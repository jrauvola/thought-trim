    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene has a 50% chance of being present (dominant) or absent (recessive), the probability of each combination is (0.5)^2 = 25%.",
    "rollout": " Since each gene has a 50% chance of being present (dominant) or absent (recessive), the probability of each combination is (0.5)^2 = 25%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But wait, the options given don't reflect that exactly. Let me look at the answer choices.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through H, each providing a specific phenotypic ratio. The correct approach is that each gene contributes a 50% chance, leading to four equally likely phenotypes. However, some of the answer choices might group them differently, especially regarding dominance. For example, checkered (c) and plain (c) may have different expressions. Wait, but in this case, both c and b are recessive. So each bird either has C (red) or c (plain), and B (brown) or b (checkered). Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these four has a 25% chance, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer choices directly match this. Instead, looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe \"red\" is a higher pigment than \"brown,\" making \"red\" the dominant phenotype. Similarly, \"checkered\" is another phenotype. So the actual phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none directly reflect this 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, let's consider the possibility that \"red\" and \"brown\" might have different dominance relationships. Suppose \"red\" is dominant over \"brown,\" meaning that any presence of C results in red color, regardless of B. Then, the phenotypes could be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nIn this scenario, if \"red\" is dominant over \"brown,\" then any bird with a dominant C would have red color, regardless of B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain (c) and brown (b)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nHere, the probabilities would still be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the answer choices don't align with this. Perhaps I'm missing something else. Looking back, the options include ones like checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. These numbers add up to 16, suggesting 16 possible phenotypes, implying that the F2 generation has multiple genotypes contributing to different phenotypes. This suggests that the parents' genotypes aren't simple homozygotes but instead involve multiple alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not homozygous. Let me go back to the problem statement. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo their F1 would be CcBb, as I previously thought. Then, F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, producing offspring with various genotypes, including CC (C and C), Cc (C and c), cc (c and c), and bb (b and b). Each of these has a certain probability. Now, the F2 generation's phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C/c):\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), it's plain.\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), it's brown.\n- If b is present (b_), it's checkered.\n\nThe phenotypes combine both traits. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and B is present. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C_ and b_: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. c_ and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. c_ and b_: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of both genes. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective trait. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of each combination is 25%, as each gene has a 50% chance of being present or not.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, they seem to group the phenotypes into categories rather than listing them individually. Let me see what the options suggest.\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the 4x4 Punnett square. But how does this relate to the actual probabilities?\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in counting the number of each phenotype type in the F2 generation, regardless of their exact probabilities. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are formed by combining CB and cb gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations where C appears alone or B appears alone. Wait, no, because the parents are homozygous, so only the gametes CB and cb are present. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: impossible, since F1 can't produce CC gametes\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 50%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB: impossible\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 50%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that's nine possible genotypes, each at 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nLet me count each phenotype:\n\n1. C_ (pigment red) and B_: brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_ and b_: checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. c_ (plain) and B_: brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, for each phenotype, how many genotypes lead to it?\n\nFor Checkered red (C_ B_):\n- C_ occurs in 75% of cases (since C is dominant), but within those, B_ also occurs. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So for pigment color, any C results in red. For body color, any B results in brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether both C and B are present (Checkered red), or C is present and B is not (Plain red), or neither is present (Checkered brown), or both are not present (Plain brown).\n\nTo determine the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use the rules of Mendelian inheritance. The F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene separately due to independent assortment, but combined, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of each phenotype based on the genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): All genotypes where C is present and B is present. In the F2, the percentage of such genotypes is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%. But since we have discrete generations, we'll look at actual counts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible genotypes and categorize them into phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_ B_) | Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb | ?\nWait, no, actually, the presence of C and B both dominant leads to Checkered red. So any bird with at least one C and at least one B will display Checkered red. Similarly, if only C is present (any B), it's Plain red. If neither is present, it's Plain brown.\n\nLet me recast the F2 genotypes into their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_, B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_, Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_, bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_, B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_, Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_, bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_, B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_, Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_, bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 possible genotypes (as listed above). Now, the actual number of each phenotype in the population would depend on the total number of individuals, but since we're dealing with ratios, we can express it as:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9\n- Checkered brown: 1/9\n- Plain red: 1/9\n- Plain brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\nBut the answer choices don't present fractions; they present absolute counts. Let's assume the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, as each gene has two alleles, leading to 2^n possible phenotypes. Wait, no, for each gene, 2^2 = 4 possibilities, so overall 4 x 4 = 16. However, the answer choices don't reach 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but the distribution is uneven\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Zero plain red, which seems unlikely unless all offspring are red\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16\n\nFrom my earlier breakdown, the proportions were 4 Checkered red, 1 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, and 3 Plain brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. However, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which sums to 16, but the distribution is inverted compared to my calculation. Option E has Plain red 1, which contradicts my finding that Plain red is 1 case (Case 6).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Case 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 16 birds (assuming diploid for each gene), but perhaps the actual number is 16. However, the answer choices don't specify the total; they just ask for the ratio. So, the proportions are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- Plain brown: 3/9 = 33.33%\n\nBut none of the answer choices match these exactly. However, option D is Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, summing to 16. That doesn't align with my calculations. Option E has Plain red 1, which isn't correct. Option C has plain red 3 and plain brown 1, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype to the others, not their absolute counts. So, the ratio of Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown would be 4 : 1 : 1 : 3. Simplifying this ratio by dividing each by 1 gives 4:1:1:3, which isn't among the answer choices. Alternatively, if we scale the ratio to make the smallest number 1, it becomes 4:1:1:3, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which includes all four phenotypes. The options provide different ratios. Among the options, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. If I consider the F2 generation size as 16, this would mean that each phenotype accounts for a fraction of the total. But according to my analysis, the actual numbers are 4 Checkered red, 1 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, and 3 Plain brown. To get the same proportions as option D, perhaps the F2 generation is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each bird is diploid for each gene, leading to 16 possible combinations, but the options represent the ratios without considering the total number. In that case, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown to Plain red to Plain brown would be 4:1:1:3, which doesn't match any option except option D, which lists 1,3,9,3. This discrepancy suggests I may have made an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the inheritance pattern. For the coat color, red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, the order matters. Let's say the genes are ordered as follows: C (dominant, red) before B (dominant, brown). So, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it's Checkered red. If it has C and not B, it's Plain red. If it has not C but has B, it's Checkered brown. And if it has neither, it's Plain brown.\n\nGiven this, the F2 generation would have the following genotypes:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) and B_ (body brown): Checkered red\n- C_ and b_: Plain red\n- cc (plain) and B_ (brown): Checkered brown\n- cc and b_: Plain brown\n\nCalculating the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Probability of having at least one C and at least one B. This is 1 minus the probability of not having C plus not having B. So, 1 - (prob(c) * prob(b)) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.75. So 75% of the F2 should be Checkered red.\n- Plain red: Probability of having C but not B. So, 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n- Checkered brown: Probability of not having C but having B. Again, 0.25.\n- Plain brown: Probability of not having either C or B. 0.25.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 3:1:1:1 for Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. However, looking at option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with 3:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects the F2 generation to be considered as having 16 birds, with each genotype represented once. In that case, the F2 would have:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n-",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene has a 50% chance of being present (dominant) or absent (recessive), the probability of each combination is (0.5)^2 = 25%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But wait, the options given don't reflect that exactly. Let me look at the answer choices.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through H, each providing a specific phenotypic ratio. The correct approach is that each gene contributes a 50% chance, leading to four equally likely phenotypes. However, some of the answer choices might group them differently, especially regarding dominance. For example, checkered (c) and plain (c) may have different expressions. Wait, but in this case, both c and b are recessive. So each bird either has C (red) or c (plain), and B (brown) or b (checkered). Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these four has a 25% chance, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer choices directly match this. Instead, looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe \"red\" is a higher pigment than \"brown,\" making \"red\" the dominant phenotype. Similarly, \"checkered\" is another phenotype. So the actual phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none directly reflect this 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, let's consider the possibility that \"red\" and \"brown\" might have different dominance relationships. Suppose \"red\" is dominant over \"brown,\" meaning that any presence of C results in red color, regardless of B. Then, the phenotypes could be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nIn this scenario, if \"red\" is dominant over \"brown,\" then any bird with a dominant C would have red color, regardless of B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain (c) and brown (b)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nHere, the probabilities would still be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the answer choices don't align with this. Perhaps I'm missing something else. Looking back, the options include ones like checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. These numbers add up to 16, suggesting 16 possible phenotypes, implying that the F2 generation has multiple genotypes contributing to different phenotypes. This suggests that the parents' genotypes aren't simple homozygotes but instead involve multiple alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not homozygous. Let me go back to the problem statement. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo their F1 would be CcBb, as I previously thought. Then, F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, producing offspring with various genotypes, including CC (C and C), Cc (C and c), cc (c and c), and bb (b and b). Each of these has a certain probability. Now, the F2 generation's phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C/c):\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), it's plain.\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), it's brown.\n- If b is present (b_), it's checkered.\n\nThe phenotypes combine both traits. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and B is present. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C_ and b_: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. c_ and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. c_ and b_: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of both genes. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective trait. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of each combination is 25%, as each gene has a 50% chance of being present or not.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, they seem to group the phenotypes into categories rather than listing them individually. Let me see what the options suggest.\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the 4x4 Punnett square. But how does this relate to the actual probabilities?\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in counting the number of each phenotype type in the F2 generation, regardless of their exact probabilities. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are formed by combining CB and cb gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations where C appears alone or B appears alone. Wait, no, because the parents are homozygous, so only the gametes CB and cb are present. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: impossible, since F1 can't produce CC gametes\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 50%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB: impossible\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 50%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that's nine possible genotypes, each at 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nLet me count each phenotype:\n\n1. C_ (pigment red) and B_: brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_ and b_: checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. c_ (plain) and B_: brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, for each phenotype, how many genotypes lead to it?\n\nFor Checkered red (C_ B_):\n- C_ occurs in 75% of cases (since C is dominant), but within those, B_ also occurs. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So for pigment color, any C results in red. For body color, any B results in brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether both C and B are present (Checkered red), or C is present and B is not (Plain red), or neither is present (Checkered brown), or both are not present (Plain brown).\n\nTo determine the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use the rules of Mendelian inheritance. The F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene separately due to independent assortment, but combined, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of each phenotype based on the genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ B_): All genotypes where C is present and B is present. In the F2, the percentage of such genotypes is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%. But since we have discrete generations, we'll look at actual counts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible genotypes and categorize them into phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (C_ B_) | Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb | ?\nWait, no, actually, the presence of C and B both dominant leads to Checkered red. So any bird with at least one C and at least one B will display Checkered red. Similarly, if only C is present (any B), it's Plain red. If neither is present, it's Plain brown.\n\nLet me recast the F2 genotypes into their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_, B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_, Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_, bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_, B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_, Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_, bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_, B_ \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_, Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_, bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 possible genotypes (as listed above). Now, the actual number of each phenotype in the population would depend on the total number of individuals, but since we're dealing with ratios, we can express it as:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9\n- Checkered brown: 1/9\n- Plain red: 1/9\n- Plain brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\nBut the answer choices don't present fractions; they present absolute counts. Let's assume the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, as each gene has two alleles, leading to 2^n possible phenotypes. Wait, no, for each gene, 2^2 = 4 possibilities, so overall 4 x 4 = 16. However, the answer choices don't reach 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but the distribution is uneven\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Zero plain red, which seems unlikely unless all offspring are red\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16\n\nFrom my earlier breakdown, the proportions were 4 Checkered red, 1 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, and 3 Plain brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. However, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which sums to 16, but the distribution is inverted compared to my calculation. Option E has Plain red 1, which contradicts my finding that Plain red is 1 case (Case 6).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Case 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 16 birds (assuming diploid for each gene), but perhaps the actual number is 16. However, the answer choices don't specify the total; they just ask for the ratio. So, the proportions are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- Plain brown: 3/9 = 33.33%\n\nBut none of the answer choices match these exactly. However, option D is Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, summing to 16. That doesn't align with my calculations. Option E has Plain red 1, which isn't correct. Option C has plain red 3 and plain brown 1, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype to the others, not their absolute counts. So, the ratio of Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown would be 4 : 1 : 1 : 3. Simplifying this ratio by dividing each by 1 gives 4:1:1:3, which isn't among the answer choices. Alternatively, if we scale the ratio to make the smallest number 1, it becomes 4:1:1:3, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which includes all four phenotypes. The options provide different ratios. Among the options, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. If I consider the F2 generation size as 16, this would mean that each phenotype accounts for a fraction of the total. But according to my analysis, the actual numbers are 4 Checkered red, 1 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, and 3 Plain brown. To get the same proportions as option D, perhaps the F2 generation is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each bird is diploid for each gene, leading to 16 possible combinations, but the options represent the ratios without considering the total number. In that case, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown to Plain red to Plain brown would be 4:1:1:3, which doesn't match any option except option D, which lists 1,3,9,3. This discrepancy suggests I may have made an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the inheritance pattern. For the coat color, red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, the order matters. Let's say the genes are ordered as follows: C (dominant, red) before B (dominant, brown). So, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it's Checkered red. If it has C and not B, it's Plain red. If it has not C but has B, it's Checkered brown. And if it has neither, it's Plain brown.\n\nGiven this, the F2 generation would have the following genotypes:\n\n- C_ (pigment red) and B_ (body brown): Checkered red\n- C_ and b_: Plain red\n- cc (plain) and B_ (brown): Checkered brown\n- cc and b_: Plain brown\n\nCalculating the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Probability of having at least one C and at least one B. This is 1 minus the probability of not having C plus not having B. So, 1 - (prob(c) * prob(b)) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.75. So 75% of the F2 should be Checkered red.\n- Plain red: Probability of having C but not B. So, 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n- Checkered brown: Probability of not having C but having B. Again, 0.25.\n- Plain brown: Probability of not having either C or B. 0.25.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 3:1:1:1 for Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. However, looking at option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with 3:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects the F2 generation to be considered as having 16 birds, with each genotype represented once. In that case, the F2 would have:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n-",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Given that both genes are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be found by considering the probabilities of each gene.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio. So let's consider the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) with a plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 would be the F2. So the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the alleles from the F1 parents. Each F1 bird contributes either CB or cb to the gametes. So for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of contributing C (dominant, red) = 50%\n- Probability of contributing c (recessive, plain) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of contributing B (dominant, brown) = 50%\n- Probability of contributing b (recessive, checkered) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype depends on the combination of these probabilities. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). So the probability is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Requires C dominant and B recessive. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n3. Plain and brown: Requires c (for pigment) and B dominant. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n4. Plain and checkered: Requires c and B recessive. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\nSo all four phenotypes occur equally in the F2 generation, each at 25% frequency.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that both genes are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be found by considering the probabilities of each gene.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio. So let's consider the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) with a plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 would be the F2. So the F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the alleles from the F1 parents. Each F1 bird contributes either CB or cb to the gametes. So for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of contributing C (dominant, red) = 50%\n- Probability of contributing c (recessive, plain) = 50%\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of contributing B (dominant, brown) = 50%\n- Probability of contributing b (recessive, checkered) = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the probability of having a particular phenotype depends on the combination of these probabilities. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). So the probability is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Requires C dominant and B recessive. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n3. Plain and brown: Requires c (for pigment) and B dominant. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\n4. Plain and checkered: Requires c and B recessive. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\nSo all four phenotypes occur equally in the F2 generation, each at 25% frequency. That makes sense because each gene acts independently, leading to equal distribution across all possible phenotypes. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for the four possible phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn't make sense.\nC. 12,2,2,0 \u2013 No.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 Hmm, doesn't match.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 Yes!

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

So let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2.

Maybe it's better to express them as fractions.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. To convert these into whole numbers, we can multiply each percentage by a common factor. The least common multiple of denominators 16 (since 1/16 is 0.0625) might work. Alternatively, since 56.25% is 9/16, 18.75% is 3/16, same for the others. So the ratios would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2.

Wait, no\u2014the F1 is from CC BB and cc bb, which when crossed, would produce F1 as CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. My earlier reasoning was that F2 would have four phenotypes with ratios 9:3:3:1. However, the answer options don't align with this. Perhaps the user made a mistake, or I misinterpreted the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2, but the prompt says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So I must stick with F2.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed among the options. This suggests either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the problem. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the user intended to refer to F1 instead of F2. If we consider F1, which is CcBb, then the phenotypes would be based on the F1 itself. So the F1 would be all CcBb, and thus all phenotypes would be a mix of red, brown, and checkered. But that also doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user included all F1 and F2 generations together, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Wait, so the two genes are linked? Because in reality, genes often assort independently unless they are linked by a chromosomal segment. But the question doesn't mention linkage, so perhaps it's assumed to be independent. Therefore, the Punnett square approach holds, treating the two genes separately.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1, but none of the options reflect this. Hmm. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Total 18. Doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16. Closest to 9:3:3:1, but scaled differently.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. Again, similar scaling.\n\nHmm, perhaps the actual question expects us to use dihybrid crosses without considering independent assortment, leading to a different ratio. But that would be incorrect under standard genetics principles.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included F1 in the question mistakenly. Let me see:\n\nThe user wrote: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So that's F1. Then, they ask about F2. But perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypes, but the user mistakenly continued to discuss F2 later. Alternatively, perhaps the user included F1 in the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option F is 4 each, which corresponds to 1:1:1:1, which wouldn't apply here. Option J: 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option A: 6,2,6,2 summing to 16. None match 9:3:3:1.\n\nThis indicates that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options provided. However, since the user expects an answer from A to H, I'll have to choose the closest match despite the discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let's reconsider the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color (gene C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor body color (gene B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Pigment red (C) OR brown (B): so both C and B dominant.\n- Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): C dominant, B recessive.\n- Plain (c) AND brown (B): c recessive, B dominant.\n- Plain (c) AND checkered (b): both recessive.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes and their probabilities are indeed 25% each for the four combinations, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options don't have 1:1:1:1. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different scenario, such as considering the F1 instead of F2.\n\nIf we look at F1, which is CcBb, then the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these would occur at a 25% rate, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options reflect this either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered only one trait, ignoring the other. But the question clearly involves two traits, so that's not applicable.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user mixed up the phenotypes. Let me recount the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 25%\n3. Plain and brown: 25%\n4. Plain and checkered: 25%\n\nTotal: 100%.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is 25% each, which doesn't match any of the provided options. This suggests that perhaps the user intended to provide a different scenario or made an error in the question.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best choice is to select an option that best fits the scenario, even if it's not exact. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum to 16, which is close to 16 possible phenotypes (4 phenotypes, each with 4 individuals). But the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't represented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe the F1 phenotypes, which would all be 100% checkered (since both parents are checkered), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's not reflected in the options either.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided options, none perfectly match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n- Probability of C (red) = 75% (since CC and Cc)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 25%\n\nFor the body color gene (B/b):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 75%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but the options given don't include decimal points. Maybe it's better to express them as fractions.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. To convert these into whole numbers, we can multiply each percentage by a common factor. The least common multiple of denominators 16 (since 1/16 is 0.0625) might work. Alternatively, since 56.25% is 9/16, 18.75% is 3/16, same for the others. So the ratios would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me approach this systematically.",
    "rollout": " Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the genotypic ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parent 1 (CC) can only produce CB gametes.\n- Parent 2 (cc) can only produce cb gametes.\nSo F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB gametes, so F2 for C locus:\n- 100% CB (so for C, presence is always dominant)\n\nFor the B locus:\nParent 1 (BB) can produce BB or Bb gametes?\nWait, no. Parent 1 is CC BB. So he has two Cs and two Bs. He can only produce gametes where he contributes one C and one B. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, producing only cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB gametes, leading to F2:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- For C: All individuals will have at least one C, so all Cc (since F1 is Cc) will remain as such. Wait, no\u2014wait, the C locus comes from F1's Cc, which will lead to F2 being CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly, the B locus comes from F1's Bb (since F1 is CcBb, so each has one B and one b allele?), no\u2014wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb, respectively. So F1 (CcBb) will have:\n\n- C: 50% (from C parent) and B: 50% (from B parent)\n- So F1's genotype is CcBb, meaning for each gene:\n  - C: 50% C and 50% c\n  - B: 50% B and 50% b\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the segregation follows independent assortment, so each gene segregates independently. Thus, the F2 for each gene will be:\n\nFor C:\n- 25% CC (dominant)\n- 50% Cc (dominant)\n- 25% cc (recessive)\n\nFor B:\n- 25% BB (dominant)\n- 50% Bb (dominant)\n- 25% bb (recessive)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotypic ratios are products of the individual ratios. That is, for each combination of C and B traits, we calculate the probability.\n\nNow, mapping these into phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. Both dominant: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red bird\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red bird\n3. C recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain brown bird\n4. Both recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown bird\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a fourth phenotype. Let me check the options again. Looking back at the user's choices, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if an animal is C dominant and B dominant, it's Checkered red. If C dominant and B recessive, it's Plain red. If C recessive and B dominant, it's Plain brown. If both recessive, it's Checkered brown. That seems right. \n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. Assuming that the F1 selfing produces 100% F2, which includes 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for each gene.\n\nBut wait, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of being Checkered red is the product of being C dominant (50%) and B dominant (50%) = 25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered red: 25% (1/4)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (1/4) [C recessive (25%) and B dominant (50%)]\n- Plain red: 25% (C recessive, B recessive)\n- Plain brown: 25% (C dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each combination would require specific calculations. Let me list them properly:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Checkered brown: C recessive (25%) and B dominant (50%) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Plain red: C recessive (25%) and B recessive (25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: C dominant (50%) and B recessive (25%) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n\nAdding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates an error in my approach. Instead, I should consider the actual numbers by looking at the F2 generation's genotypic ratios, then convert those to phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet's construct the F2 genotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, combine these:\n\nEach combination is a pair of C and B genotypes. The total number of genotypic combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9. However, some of these combinations may result in the same phenotype. To count phenotypically, we look for each bird's phenotype based on their C and B alleles.\n\nBut instead of counting each bird individually, perhaps it's easier to calculate the frequency of each phenotype. For example:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (probability 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain red (0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown (0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125)\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625)\n\nWait, adding these: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.6875, which still doesn't add up to 1. This discrepancy arises because the sum of all phenotypic probabilities isn't 1 due to overlapping counts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to count the phenotypes. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the number of F2 individuals.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation consists of 9 individuals (as the Punnett square for F1 x F1), but since F1 itself is a dihybrid, the F2 will have 16 individuals (each F1 gamete combines with another F1 gamete). Wait, but the user didn't specify whether it's F1 x F1 or F2 x F1. In the user's question, it's a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), so likely it's F1 (from CC BB x cc bb) selfed (to get F2), but the user might be referring to F2 as the next generation after F1. Anyway, focusing on the phenotypic ratios:\n\nUsing the probabilities:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 100% (assuming complete dominance).\n\nPhenotype frequencies:\n- Checkered red: 25% (from 0.5*0.5)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from 0.25*0.5)\n- Plain red: 25% (from 0.5*0.25)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from 0.25*0.25)\n\nWait, but that sums to 100%, so perhaps the user considers each phenotype as 25% of the population. However, looking back at the options, none of them have 25% for each phenotype. The closest option is A, which lists 6, 2, 6, 2\u2014summing to 12, which suggests a population size of 12. If we assume a population size of 12, then each phenotype would occur 3 times (12 / 4 = 3). But the options don't have a 3 for any except D, which also has 3. Option D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected number based on the actual F2 genotypes. Let's take a sample of 16 animals (F2 generation):\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios:\n- 25% CC (so 4 individuals)\n- 50% Cc (8 individuals)\n- 25% cc (4 individuals)\n- 25% BB (4 individuals)\n- 50% Bb (8 individuals)\n- 25% bb (4 individuals)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant): 4 individuals, all Checkered red\n- Cc (C dominant): 8 individuals, all Checkered red (since C is dominant, regardless of B)\n- cc (c recessive): 4 individuals, all Plain red\n- BB (B dominant): 4 individuals, all Checkered brown (since B is dominant, regardless of C)\n- Bb (B dominant): 8 individuals, all Plain brown\n- bb (b recessive): 4 individuals, all Plain brown\n\nWait, but that grouping is incorrect because each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. Let me recast it correctly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- For CC (C dominant):\n  - Any B allele makes it Checkered red\n- For Cc (C dominant):\n  - Any B allele makes it Checkered red\n- For cc (c recessive):\n  - Any B allele makes it Plain brown\n- For BB (B dominant):\n  - Any C allele makes it Checkered brown\n- For Bb (B dominant):\n  - Any C allele makes it Plain brown\n- For bb (b recessive):\n  - Any C allele makes it Plain brown\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps a better way is to create a table showing all possible combinations and assign phenotypes accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B, let's see:\n\nIf C is dominant (C_), the bird is Checkered (regardless of B).\nIf C is recessive (cc), then:\n  - If B is dominant (B_), it's Plain brown\n  - If B is recessive (bb), it's Checkered brown\n\nSimilarly, if B is dominant, regardless of C, it's Checkered red. If B is recessive, then:\n  - If C is dominant, it's Plain red\n  - If C is recessive, it's Checkered red\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- For Pigment Color (C):\n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n- For Body Color (B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on both genes. So:\n\n- If C is dominant AND B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is dominant AND B is recessive \u2192 Plain red\n- If C is recessive AND B is dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is recessive AND B is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypic ratios:\n- CC: 25% (1/4 of the F2)\n- Cc: 50% (1/2)\n- cc: 25% (1/4)\n\nAnd within each, the B alleles' distribution:\n\nFor each C genotype:\n- CC (25%): All B alleles are present. Since CC is always dominant, all are Checkered red.\n- Cc (50%): Half of these will have B dominant, half will have B recessive. So 25% CcB and 25% Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the Cc can produce either CB or cb gametes. Wait, no\u2014if F2 is derived from F1 selfing, then each Cc individual will produce 50% CB and 50% cb gametes. So among Cc, half will carry B (CB) and half will carry b (cb). Therefore, within Cc (50% of F2), 25% will be CB (which affects pigment and color), and 25% will be cb (which affects pigment and checkered).\n\nSimilarly, for cc (25% of F2): All will have cb gametes, so all will be plain brown.\n\nWithin Cc (50% F2):\n- 25% CB (pigment dominant, color dominant \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 25% cb (pigment recessive, color dominant \u2192 Plain red)\n\nWithin cc (25% F2):\n- All will be plain brown (since c is recessive, B must be dominant for brown).\n\nSo now, let's tabulate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Only from Cc (both dominant) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 4 individuals (if F2 population is 16)\n- Checkered brown: From cc (all have b) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 4 individuals\n- Plain red: From Cc (only cb gametes \u2192 25% of F2) \u2192 4 individuals\n- Plain brown: From cc and Cc (but wait, in Cc, 50% are cb \u2192 all plain red? Wait, confusion arises.)\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So, the breakdown should be:\n\n- C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Plain red\n- C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nIn terms of F2 population:\n\n- C dominant: 75% (25% CC + 50% Cc)\n  - Of these, B dominant: 75% (25% BB + 50% Bb)\n    - Total Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25% \u2192 4 in a population of 16\n  - B recessive: 25% (25% bb)\n    - Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3 in a population of 16\n- C recessive: 25% (cc)\n  - Of these, B dominant: 50% (50% Bb)\n    - Plain brown: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 in a population of 16\n  - B recessive: 50% (50% bb)\n    - Checkered brown: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 in a population of 16\n\nAdding these together:\n- Checkered red: 56.25% \u2248 9\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \u2248 2\n- Plain red: 18.75% \u2248 3\n- Plain brown: 12.5% \u2248 2\n\nWait, but that totals 9 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 16, which matches our assumption of 16 individuals. However, none of the answer options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the genotypic ratios for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parent 1 (CC) can only produce CB gametes.\n- Parent 2 (cc) can only produce cb gametes.\nSo F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB gametes, so F2 for C locus:\n- 100% CB (so for C, presence is always dominant)\n\nFor the B locus:\nParent 1 (BB) can produce BB or Bb gametes?\nWait, no. Parent 1 is CC BB. So he has two Cs and two Bs. He can only produce gametes where he contributes one C and one B. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, producing only cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB gametes, leading to F2:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- For C: All individuals will have at least one C, so all Cc (since F1 is Cc) will remain as such. Wait, no\u2014wait, the C locus comes from F1's Cc, which will lead to F2 being CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly, the B locus comes from F1's Bb (since F1 is CcBb, so each has one B and one b allele?), no\u2014wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb, respectively. So F1 (CcBb) will have:\n\n- C: 50% (from C parent) and B: 50% (from B parent)\n- So F1's genotype is CcBb, meaning for each gene:\n  - C: 50% C and 50% c\n  - B: 50% B and 50% b\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the segregation follows independent assortment, so each gene segregates independently. Thus, the F2 for each gene will be:\n\nFor C:\n- 25% CC (dominant)\n- 50% Cc (dominant)\n- 25% cc (recessive)\n\nFor B:\n- 25% BB (dominant)\n- 50% Bb (dominant)\n- 25% bb (recessive)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotypic ratios are products of the individual ratios. That is, for each combination of C and B traits, we calculate the probability.\n\nNow, mapping these into phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. Both dominant: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red bird\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red bird\n3. C recessive (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Plain brown bird\n4. Both recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Checkered brown bird\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a fourth phenotype. Let me check the options again. Looking back at the user's choices, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if an animal is C dominant and B dominant, it's Checkered red. If C dominant and B recessive, it's Plain red. If C recessive and B dominant, it's Plain brown. If both recessive, it's Checkered brown. That seems right. \n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. Assuming that the F1 selfing produces 100% F2, which includes 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for each gene.\n\nBut wait, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of being Checkered red is the product of being C dominant (50%) and B dominant (50%) = 25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered red: 25% (1/4)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (1/4) [C recessive (25%) and B dominant (50%)]\n- Plain red: 25% (C recessive, B recessive)\n- Plain brown: 25% (C dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each combination would require specific calculations. Let me list them properly:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Checkered brown: C recessive (25%) and B dominant (50%) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Plain red: C recessive (25%) and B recessive (25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: C dominant (50%) and B recessive (25%) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n\nAdding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates an error in my approach. Instead, I should consider the actual numbers by looking at the F2 generation's genotypic ratios, then convert those to phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet's construct the F2 genotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, combine these:\n\nEach combination is a pair of C and B genotypes. The total number of genotypic combinations is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9. However, some of these combinations may result in the same phenotype. To count phenotypically, we look for each bird's phenotype based on their C and B alleles.\n\nBut instead of counting each bird individually, perhaps it's easier to calculate the frequency of each phenotype. For example:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (probability 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain red (0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown (0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125)\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625)\n\nWait, adding these: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.6875, which still doesn't add up to 1. This discrepancy arises because the sum of all phenotypic probabilities isn't 1 due to overlapping counts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to count the phenotypes. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the number of F2 individuals.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation consists of 9 individuals (as the Punnett square for F1 x F1), but since F1 itself is a dihybrid, the F2 will have 16 individuals (each F1 gamete combines with another F1 gamete). Wait, but the user didn't specify whether it's F1 x F1 or F2 x F1. In the user's question, it's a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), so likely it's F1 (from CC BB x cc bb) selfed (to get F2), but the user might be referring to F2 as the next generation after F1. Anyway, focusing on the phenotypic ratios:\n\nUsing the probabilities:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 100% (assuming complete dominance).\n\nPhenotype frequencies:\n- Checkered red: 25% (from 0.5*0.5)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from 0.25*0.5)\n- Plain red: 25% (from 0.5*0.25)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from 0.25*0.25)\n\nWait, but that sums to 100%, so perhaps the user considers each phenotype as 25% of the population. However, looking back at the options, none of them have 25% for each phenotype. The closest option is A, which lists 6, 2, 6, 2\u2014summing to 12, which suggests a population size of 12. If we assume a population size of 12, then each phenotype would occur 3 times (12 / 4 = 3). But the options don't have a 3 for any except D, which also has 3. Option D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected number based on the actual F2 genotypes. Let's take a sample of 16 animals (F2 generation):\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios:\n- 25% CC (so 4 individuals)\n- 50% Cc (8 individuals)\n- 25% cc (4 individuals)\n- 25% BB (4 individuals)\n- 50% Bb (8 individuals)\n- 25% bb (4 individuals)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant): 4 individuals, all Checkered red\n- Cc (C dominant): 8 individuals, all Checkered red (since C is dominant, regardless of B)\n- cc (c recessive): 4 individuals, all Plain red\n- BB (B dominant): 4 individuals, all Checkered brown (since B is dominant, regardless of C)\n- Bb (B dominant): 8 individuals, all Plain brown\n- bb (b recessive): 4 individuals, all Plain brown\n\nWait, but that grouping is incorrect because each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. Let me recast it correctly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- For CC (C dominant):\n  - Any B allele makes it Checkered red\n- For Cc (C dominant):\n  - Any B allele makes it Checkered red\n- For cc (c recessive):\n  - Any B allele makes it Plain brown\n- For BB (B dominant):\n  - Any C allele makes it Checkered brown\n- For Bb (B dominant):\n  - Any C allele makes it Plain brown\n- For bb (b recessive):\n  - Any C allele makes it Plain brown\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps a better way is to create a table showing all possible combinations and assign phenotypes accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B, let's see:\n\nIf C is dominant (C_), the bird is Checkered (regardless of B).\nIf C is recessive (cc), then:\n  - If B is dominant (B_), it's Plain brown\n  - If B is recessive (bb), it's Checkered brown\n\nSimilarly, if B is dominant, regardless of C, it's Checkered red. If B is recessive, then:\n  - If C is dominant, it's Plain red\n  - If C is recessive, it's Checkered red\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- For Pigment Color (C):\n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n- For Body Color (B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on both genes. So:\n\n- If C is dominant AND B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is dominant AND B is recessive \u2192 Plain red\n- If C is recessive AND B is dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is recessive AND B is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypic ratios:\n- CC: 25% (1/4 of the F2)\n- Cc: 50% (1/2)\n- cc: 25% (1/4)\n\nAnd within each, the B alleles' distribution:\n\nFor each C genotype:\n- CC (25%): All B alleles are present. Since CC is always dominant, all are Checkered red.\n- Cc (50%): Half of these will have B dominant, half will have B recessive. So 25% CcB and 25% Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the Cc can produce either CB or cb gametes. Wait, no\u2014if F2 is derived from F1 selfing, then each Cc individual will produce 50% CB and 50% cb gametes. So among Cc, half will carry B (CB) and half will carry b (cb). Therefore, within Cc (50% of F2), 25% will be CB (which affects pigment and color), and 25% will be cb (which affects pigment and checkered).\n\nSimilarly, for cc (25% of F2): All will have cb gametes, so all will be plain brown.\n\nWithin Cc (50% F2):\n- 25% CB (pigment dominant, color dominant \u2192 Checkered red)\n- 25% cb (pigment recessive, color dominant \u2192 Plain red)\n\nWithin cc (25% F2):\n- All will be plain brown (since c is recessive, B must be dominant for brown).\n\nSo now, let's tabulate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Only from Cc (both dominant) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 4 individuals (if F2 population is 16)\n- Checkered brown: From cc (all have b) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 4 individuals\n- Plain red: From Cc (only cb gametes \u2192 25% of F2) \u2192 4 individuals\n- Plain brown: From cc and Cc (but wait, in Cc, 50% are cb \u2192 all plain red? Wait, confusion arises.)\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So, the breakdown should be:\n\n- C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Plain red\n- C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nIn terms of F2 population:\n\n- C dominant: 75% (25% CC + 50% Cc)\n  - Of these, B dominant: 75% (25% BB + 50% Bb)\n    - Total Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25% \u2192 4 in a population of 16\n  - B recessive: 25% (25% bb)\n    - Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3 in a population of 16\n- C recessive: 25% (cc)\n  - Of these, B dominant: 50% (50% Bb)\n    - Plain brown: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 in a population of 16\n  - B recessive: 50% (50% bb)\n    - Checkered brown: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 in a population of 16\n\nAdding these together:\n- Checkered red: 56.25% \u2248 9\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \u2248 2\n- Plain red: 18.75% \u2248 3\n- Plain brown: 12.5% \u2248 2\n\nWait, but that totals 9 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 16, which matches our assumption of 16 individuals. However, none of the answer options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Given that each bird is produced from a cross where both parents are homozygous, the probability for each trait is 25% for each, but combined with independence.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since the two genes are independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B). For pigment color: C (dominant) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, 3/4 chance), c = 1/4. Similarly, for color: B (dominant) = 3/4, b = 1/4. Since these are independent, the probability of any specific combination is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for C and B both dominant (red and brown), (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for C dominant and b recessive (red and checkered), (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for c and B dominant (plain and brown), and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for c and b recessive (plain and checkered). Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, so each contributes to the overall ratio. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly.

For pigment color: C (dominant) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, 3/4 chance), c = 1/4. Similarly, for color: B (dominant) = 3/4, b = 1/4. Since these are independent, the probability of any specific combination is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for C and B both dominant (red and brown), (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for C dominant and b recessive (red and checkered), (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for c and B dominant (plain and brown), and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for c and b recessive (plain and checkered). Adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, so each contributes to the overall ratio. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. But looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum 16?\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 sum 12 \u2192 Not matching.\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.

However, looking back at the user\u2019s question, the options listed include G as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which aligns with our calculation.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Because the actual phenotypic combinations are based on whether each gene is present or not. So the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2.

Maybe I should consider dominance effects differently. Wait, but in the case where both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, in reality, when both genes are involved, sometimes the ratios aren't perfectly balanced due to dominance relationships. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and don't influence each other beyond their effect on the same bird, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the actual dominance hierarchy, treating each phenotype as equally probable. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% plain-brown\n- cc bb: 25% plain-checkered\n\nBut wait, that's if we assume complete dominance, but in reality, if a bird is plain-red (cC), then it might not exhibit brown coloration because the checkered color is dominant over brown, or vice versa. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: The problem states that 'red' is determined by the dominant allele C, 'checkered' is determined by recessive c, 'brown' by dominant B, and 'plain' by recessive b. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for pigment color (gene C), presence (C) leads to red, absence (c) leads to plain. Similarly, for body color (gene B), presence (B) leads to brown, absence (b) leads to checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. If a bird is both C and B (red and brown), that's one phenotype. If it's C and b (red and checkered), another. If it's c and B (plain and brown), third. And c and b (plain and checkered), fourth.\n\nNow, in terms of dominance, if a bird is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body color, it'll display both traits. So, each of the four phenotypic combinations is possible, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided do not include such a ratio. Perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions A to H are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but ratio 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1 \u2192 Not matching our expectation of 1:1:1:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 2:1:0:1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This matches the expected 1:1:1:1 if scaled by 3, but why does it say 9,3,3,1 instead of 1:1:1:1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount the possible F2 phenotypes. Each gene has two possible alleles, leading to four possible phenotypic combinations, each with a 25% chance. So, if all four combinations are equally likely, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would imply that the phenotypic ratio isn't uniform across all four categories. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation because the two genes are linked, but the problem doesn't mention linkage. It just asks for the expected phenotypic ratio under the assumption that genes assort independently. So, with independent assortment, each of the four phenotypic combinations should occur with equal frequency. Therefore, each phenotype should be 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut the options provided don't have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16, which would mean 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent with our expectation. Unless I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation, but that's beyond the scope of the question unless stated otherwise. The question clearly states that the genes act independently, so I shouldn't worry about linkage.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering dominance hierarchies, meaning that one gene affects the expression of the other. For example, if a bird is plain-red (cC), it cannot express the B (brown) trait because the presence of the recessive allele overrides the dominant trait. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says \"red\" is determined by C, \"brown\" by B, implying that both traits are expressed regardless of dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats each gene separately, leading to four phenotypic categories with equal likelihood, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. Looking back at the options, option C is the closest, except that it's scaled up by a factor of 3. Why would that be the case? Unless the problem considers that the dihybrid cross is not producing independent segregation, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square analysis. Let me go through it again. The F1 was CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC\n- From CB x cb: Cc\n- From cb x CB: Cc\n- From cb x cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 would have:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - CC and Cc \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB and Bb \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but the problem defines the traits as:\n\n- Pigmented color: C (red), c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown), b (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. For example, a bird with C (red) and B (brown) would be red-brown. A bird with C (red) and b (checkered) would be red-checkered, etc.\n\nIf both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, each F2 bird would have a unique phenotype based on their alleles for each gene. However, if one gene's expression masks the other, the phenotypes could combine differently. But according to the problem, neither gene's expression affects the other's. So, each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by its combination of alleles for both genes.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be fourfold, each occurring 25% of the time. But since the options don't reflect this directly, perhaps the confusion arises from the way the question is framed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype rather than their ratios. Let me try that approach.\n\nIn the F2 population, each bird's phenotype depends on their genotype. Let's map the possible genotypes to their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four cases has a 25% chance, so the counts would be 4 each (assuming 16 birds in total). But none of the options match this. Looking at the options again, option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16. So perhaps the problem is counting the number of each phenotype rather than their relative frequencies. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the question is asking for the ratio or the count. If it's the ratio, each phenotype is 25%, but the options don't reflect that. If it's the count, each would appear 4 times, but again, the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to account for the fact that some phenotypes may not exist due to dominance, but the problem doesn't mention dominance hierarchies affecting the phenotypes. It simply states the traits based on the alleles.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is considering the dihybrid cross without accounting for the actual dominance order, treating each gene as completely dominant or recessive, thereby leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the F2 generation, some phenotypes may not be observed because certain genotypes are impossible. For instance, if a bird is CC, it's always red regardless of the body color. Similarly, if it's cc, it's plain regardless of body color. But since the problem doesn't mention any restrictions on the combination of traits, it's safe to assume all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option C (9:3:3:1), which implies that some phenotypes are less frequent than others. Wait, that doesn't make sense based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the possible phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird in F2 is determined by the combination of its alleles for both genes. Since each gene has two alleles, there are four possible phenotypic combinations, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming that some combinations are impossible.\n\nWait, another angle: The problem might be referring to the number of birds with each trait rather than their ratio. For example, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, and plain-checkered colors might differ depending on the dominance. But according to the problem, each trait is determined by the presence of the dominant allele, regardless of dominance order. So, for pigment color (C), presence leads to red; absence leads to plain. For body color (B), presence leads to brown; absence leads to checkered.\n\nIf a bird is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body, it's red-brown. If C (dominant) and b (recessive), it's red-checkered. If c (recessive) and B, it's plain-brown. If c and b, it's plain-checkered. So each of these is a distinct phenotype with a 25% occurrence. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this. \n\nWait, looking at option C: 9,3,3,1. The sum is 16, which would correspond to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. If we divide each by 16, the ratios would be 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Which doesn't match the expected 1:1:1:1. So perhaps the issue is that the problem is considering the dihybrid cross without accounting for the independence of the genes, but that's contrary to standard Mendelian genetics principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the dihybrid cross involves two separate crosses, but that's not indicated. Given the options provided, and considering the most plausible scenario, option C (9:3:3:1) might be the intended answer, even though it doesn't strictly follow the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the problem is expecting to treat each gene independently and scale accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate the expected phenotypic ratio properly. In a dihybrid cross where both genes are acting independently and fully dominant, each of the four possible phenotypic combinations occurs with equal frequency. Therefore, the expected ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the problem is considering that the dihybrid cross results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but in reality, the options don't provide that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, but I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the F2 generation, some genotypes are not possible. For example, if a bird is CC BB, it's red-brown, but if another bird is CC bb, it's red-checkered, etc. Each of these is distinct and occurs 25% of the time. So, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but again, none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each trait, considering that some phenotypes might not occur as often due to dominance. But according to the problem statement, both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, so each phenotype is possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the definition of the traits. Let me clarify: The problem says \"red\" is determined by C, \"checkered\" by c, \"brown\" by B, \"plain\" by b. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red or brown. If it has at least one dominant allele for body (B), it will display brown or checkered. Therefore, a bird that is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body will display both traits, i.e., red-brown. A bird that is C (dominant) for pigment and b (recessive) for body will display red-checkered. A bird that is c (recessive) for pigment and B (dominant) for body will display plain-brown. A bird that is c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for body will display plain-checkered.\n\nEach of these combinations is a distinct phenotype, each occurring with a 25% probability. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect this, so perhaps the problem is incorrectly presented, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation, but that's beyond the scope of Mendelian inheritance unless stated. Given that, I think the correct approach is to proceed with the assumption that the dihybrid cross yields a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option C (9:3:3:1), indicating that the problem accounts for some kind of non-independence or rounding error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering that some genotypes are not possible. For example, in F1, the dihybrid cross produces 25% for each genotype. When F1 selfs, the F2 includes 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nSo, red appears twice as often as plain. Similarly, for body color:\n\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nAgain, brown appears twice as often as checkered. Combining these, the phenotypic ratio becomes 4 parts for red (since 25% CC and 50% Cc are red), and 2 parts for plain (the cc genotype). Similarly, for body color, 4 parts for brown and 2 parts for checkered. Therefore, the overall ratio is 4:2 for red vs plain and 4:2 for brown",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nSince each gene acts independently, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): red-brown\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): red-checkered\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): plain-brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each combination?\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being present or absent. So:\n\n- Probability of C (red): 50%\n- Probability of c (plain): 50%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Probability of B (brown): 50%\n- Probability of b (checkered): 50%\n\nThe combined probability for any combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nTherefore, each of the four phenotypic combinations has a 25% chance. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s when all four are equally likely. But hold on, let me double-check. Are all four combinations equally probable? Yes, because each gene contributes equally. So each combination has 25% probability. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options given, none of them seem to have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Wait, the options are:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total F2: 16 birds, but the sum doesn't match 4.\nB. 8 red, 4 brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Total 16, but 0 plain red suggests some missing data.\nC. 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Sum to 16.\nWait, my calculation says each phenotype should occur 4 times. But option C sums to 16 (9+3+3+1=16). That's consistent. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let me see how that comes into play.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe I should consider dominance effects differently. Wait, but in the case where both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, in reality, when both genes are involved, sometimes the ratios aren't perfectly balanced due to dominance relationships. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and don't influence each other beyond their effect on the same bird, perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the actual dominance hierarchy, treating each phenotype as equally probable. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% plain-brown\n- cc bb: 25% plain-checkered\n\nBut wait, that's if we assume complete dominance, but in reality, if a bird is plain-red (cC), then it might not exhibit brown coloration because the checkered color is dominant over brown, or vice versa. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: The problem states that 'red' is determined by the dominant allele C, 'checkered' is determined by recessive c, 'brown' by dominant B, and 'plain' by recessive b. So, for each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for pigment color (gene C), presence (C) leads to red, absence (c) leads to plain. Similarly, for body color (gene B), presence (B) leads to brown, absence (b) leads to checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. If a bird is both C and B (red and brown), that's one phenotype. If it's C and b (red and checkered), another. If it's c and B (plain and brown), third. And c and b (plain and checkered), fourth.\n\nNow, in terms of dominance, if a bird is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body color, it'll display both traits. So, each of the four phenotypic combinations is possible, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided do not include such a ratio. Perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions A to H are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but ratio 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1 \u2192 Not matching our expectation of 1:1:1:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 2:1:0:1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This matches the expected 1:1:1:1 if scaled by 3, but why does it say 9,3,3,1 instead of 1:1:1:1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount the possible F2 phenotypes. Each gene has two possible alleles, leading to four possible phenotypic combinations, each with a 25% chance. So, if all four combinations are equally likely, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would imply that the phenotypic ratio isn't uniform across all four categories. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation because the two genes are linked, but the problem doesn't mention linkage. It just asks for the expected phenotypic ratio under the assumption that genes assort independently. So, with independent assortment, each of the four phenotypic combinations should occur with equal frequency. Therefore, each phenotype should be 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut the options provided don't have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16, which would mean 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent with our expectation. Unless I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation, but that's beyond the scope of the question unless stated otherwise. The question clearly states that the genes act independently, so I shouldn't worry about linkage.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering dominance hierarchies, meaning that one gene affects the expression of the other. For example, if a bird is plain-red (cC), it cannot express the B (brown) trait because the presence of the recessive allele overrides the dominant trait. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says \"red\" is determined by C, \"brown\" by B, implying that both traits are expressed regardless of dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats each gene separately, leading to four phenotypic categories with equal likelihood, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. Looking back at the options, option C is the closest, except that it's scaled up by a factor of 3. Why would that be the case? Unless the problem considers that the dihybrid cross is not producing independent segregation, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square analysis. Let me go through it again. The F1 was CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC\n- From CB x cb: Cc\n- From cb x CB: Cc\n- From cb x cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 would have:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - CC and Cc \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB and Bb \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but the problem defines the traits as:\n\n- Pigmented color: C (red), c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown), b (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. For example, a bird with C (red) and B (brown) would be red-brown. A bird with C (red) and b (checkered) would be red-checkered, etc.\n\nIf both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, each F2 bird would have a unique phenotype based on their alleles for each gene. However, if one gene's expression masks the other, the phenotypes could combine differently. But according to the problem, neither gene's expression affects the other's. So, each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by its combination of alleles for both genes.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be fourfold, each occurring 25% of the time. But since the options don't reflect this directly, perhaps the confusion arises from the way the question is framed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype rather than their ratios. Let me try that approach.\n\nIn the F2 population, each bird's phenotype depends on their genotype. Let's map the possible genotypes to their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these four cases has a 25% chance, so the counts would be 4 each (assuming 16 birds in total). But none of the options match this. Looking at the options again, option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16. So perhaps the problem is counting the number of each phenotype rather than their relative frequencies. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the question is asking for the ratio or the count. If it's the ratio, each phenotype is 25%, but the options don't reflect that. If it's the count, each would appear 4 times, but again, the options don't align. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to account for the fact that some phenotypes may not exist due to dominance, but the problem doesn't mention dominance hierarchies affecting the phenotypes. It simply states the traits based on the alleles.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is considering the dihybrid cross without accounting for the actual dominance order, treating each gene as completely dominant or recessive, thereby leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the F2 generation, some phenotypes may not be observed because certain genotypes are impossible. For instance, if a bird is CC, it's always red regardless of the body color. Similarly, if it's cc, it's plain regardless of body color. But since the problem doesn't mention any restrictions on the combination of traits, it's safe to assume all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option C (9:3:3:1), which implies that some phenotypes are less frequent than others. Wait, that doesn't make sense based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the possible phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird in F2 is determined by the combination of its alleles for both genes. Since each gene has two alleles, there are four possible phenotypic combinations, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming that some combinations are impossible.\n\nWait, another angle: The problem might be referring to the number of birds with each trait rather than their ratio. For example, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, and plain-checkered colors might differ depending on the dominance. But according to the problem, each trait is determined by the presence of the dominant allele, regardless of dominance order. So, for pigment color (C), presence leads to red; absence leads to plain. For body color (B), presence leads to brown; absence leads to checkered.\n\nIf a bird is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body, it's red-brown. If C (dominant) and b (recessive), it's red-checkered. If c (recessive) and B, it's plain-brown. If c and b, it's plain-checkered. So each of these is a distinct phenotype with a 25% occurrence. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this. \n\nWait, looking at option C: 9,3,3,1. The sum is 16, which would correspond to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. If we divide each by 16, the ratios would be 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Which doesn't match the expected 1:1:1:1. So perhaps the issue is that the problem is considering the dihybrid cross without accounting for the independence of the genes, but that's contrary to standard Mendelian genetics principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the dihybrid cross involves two separate crosses, but that's not indicated. Given the options provided, and considering the most plausible scenario, option C (9:3:3:1) might be the intended answer, even though it doesn't strictly follow the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the problem is expecting to treat each gene independently and scale accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate the expected phenotypic ratio properly. In a dihybrid cross where both genes are acting independently and fully dominant, each of the four possible phenotypic combinations occurs with equal frequency. Therefore, the expected ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the problem is considering that the dihybrid cross results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but in reality, the options don't provide that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, but I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the F2 generation, some genotypes are not possible. For example, if a bird is CC BB, it's red-brown, but if another bird is CC bb, it's red-checkered, etc. Each of these is distinct and occurs 25% of the time. So, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but again, none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each trait, considering that some phenotypes might not occur as often due to dominance. But according to the problem statement, both traits are expressed regardless of dominance, so each phenotype is possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the definition of the traits. Let me clarify: The problem says \"red\" is determined by C, \"checkered\" by c, \"brown\" by B, \"plain\" by b. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red or brown. If it has at least one dominant allele for body (B), it will display brown or checkered. Therefore, a bird that is C (dominant) for pigment and B (dominant) for body will display both traits, i.e., red-brown. A bird that is C (dominant) for pigment and b (recessive) for body will display red-checkered. A bird that is c (recessive) for pigment and B (dominant) for body will display plain-brown. A bird that is c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for body will display plain-checkered.\n\nEach of these combinations is a distinct phenotype, each occurring with a 25% probability. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect this, so perhaps the problem is incorrectly presented, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing independent segregation, but that's beyond the scope of Mendelian inheritance unless stated. Given that, I think the correct approach is to proceed with the assumption that the dihybrid cross yields a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option C (9:3:3:1), indicating that the problem accounts for some kind of non-independence or rounding error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering that some genotypes are not possible. For example, in F1, the dihybrid cross produces 25% for each genotype. When F1 selfs, the F2 includes 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nSo, red appears twice as often as plain. Similarly, for body color:\n\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nAgain, brown appears twice as often as checkered. Combining these, the phenotypic ratio becomes 4 parts for red (since 25% CC and 50% Cc are red), and 2 parts for plain (the cc genotype). Similarly, for body color, 4 parts for brown and 2 parts for checkered. Therefore, the overall ratio is 4:2 for red vs plain and 4:2 for brown",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of C being present is 75% (since C is dominant) and c is 25%, while B is 75% (B dominant) and b is 25%.",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of C being present is 75% (since C is dominant) and c is 25%, while B is 75% (B dominant) and b is 25%. Wait, no\u2014that's if the parents were heterozygotes. In our case, the parents are homozygous for both genes. Parent 1 is CC BB, so C is always dominant, and B is always dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so c is always recessive, and b is always recessive. Therefore, all the offspring will inherit either the dominant or recessive alleles for each gene. Specifically:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- All offspring will have at least one C allele because both parents are CC. Therefore, all offspring will have pigment (red). Only the c allele would lead to plain.\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- Both parents are BB and bb respectively, so all offspring will get one B and one b allele. Therefore, all offspring will have brown color (since B is dominant).\n\nWait, hold on. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then when they mate, all the offspring will receive one C from Parent 1 and one c from Parent 2. Similarly, they'll receive one B from Parent 1 and one b from Parent 2. Therefore, all offspring will be Cc and Bb, resulting in all red and brown. That's interesting because typically, dihybrid crosses involve more complexity, like considering different genotypes leading to different phenotypes. But in this case, since both parents are homozygous for both genes, the offspring will always have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all offspring will display both traits as dominant. So the phenotypes for all F2 individuals would be red and brown. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means both alleles are dominant for pigment and both for color. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both are recessive. Therefore, any gamete from Parent 1 will carry CC, and any gamete from Parent 2 will carry cc. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so they can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so they can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) would produce CB and cb gametes in a 1:1 ratio. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 all red and brown\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 red and brown\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 same as above\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain and brown\n\nSo the F2 would consist of four types of birds: CC BB (all red and brown), CcBb (same), cc BB (plain and brown), and cc bb (plain and brown). But how many of each? Since each gamete is produced in a 1:1 ratio, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all red and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (red and brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain and brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain and brown)\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, none directly match this scenario. Wait, the options seem to suggest different phenotypic ratios. Let me see what the options say.\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to J):\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nHmm, in my earlier reasoning, all F2 birds would be either all red and brown or plain and brown. So the phenotypic ratio would be 75% red-brown and 25% plain-brown. Looking at option D, which states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with my previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question isn't assuming that both parents are homozygous for both genes. Let me reread the question. Ah, no\u2014the parents are homozygous for both genes: Parent 1 is CC BB, Parent 2 is cc bb. So indeed, all F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them all red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should reflect that all F2 are red-brown, except those without the dominant allele for B, which is the plain bird. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird would be red and brown regardless. So all F2 would be red and brown. But that contradicts some of the options, as all options seem to mix red and brown with plain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB (since checkered implies c, and red is dominant for pigment)\n- Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb (plain implies recessive c, brown implies dominant B)\n\nTherefore, all offspring will be CcBb, which results in all red and brown (since both genes are dominant in all offspring). Therefore, all F2 would be red and brown. But looking at the options, none seem to fit this exactly. Wait, but perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The phenotype depends on whether the dominant alleles are present.\n\nIn Parent 1 (CC BB):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n\n- c is recessive (plain)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nWhen crossed, all offspring will have Cc (from C and c) and Bb (from B and b). Therefore, all offspring will have pigment (red) and brown (since B is dominant), making them red and brown. Thus, all F2 are red-brown. However, looking at the options, none directly state that. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the parent genotypes.\n\nWait, the user provided the parents as:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, producing 25% CC BB, 25% CcBb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc Bb. But wait, in reality, since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio should consider the combinations of both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's re-examine the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, meaning both alleles are dominant for both traits. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive. Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb, which means all will have at least one dominant allele for both traits, resulting in red and brown. Thus, all F2 will also have at least one dominant allele for both, hence all red and brown.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this exact scenario. Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This suggests that some F2 might be plain and brown, implying that not all offspring have the dominant alleles for both traits.\n\nAh, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me look again:\n\nThe question says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. So when crossed, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWait, but in this case, all F2 would be CcBb, which would express as red and brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant). Thus, all F2 would be red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% red and brown. But the options don't include such an option. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc Bb. That would make more sense because then the F1 would have mixed alleles, leading to varied phenotypes in the F2.\n\nLet me reevaluate. Suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and Parent 2 is cc Bb (heterozygous for B and recessive for b). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb. The F2 would result from crossing Cc Bb x Cc Bb. Now, let's calculate the phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B): dominant C \u2192 red; otherwise, plain.\n- Body color (B/b): dominant B \u2192 brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nThus, for each bird in F2, the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 red and brown.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 red and checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 plain and brown.\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc Bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb (from Cc and Bb). Then, F2 would be:\n\nPossible gametes from F1 (Cc Bb):\n\n- Cc Bb (with 25% chance)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014when you cross Cc Bb x Cc Bb, the possible gametes are:\n\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red; Body: B is dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n2. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: C \u2192 red; Body: b \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n3. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: c \u2192 plain; Body: B \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: c \u2192 plain; Body: b \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Pheno A: red and brown \u2192 25%\n- Pheno B: red and checkered \u2192 25%\n- Pheno C: plain and brown \u2192 25%\n- Pheno D: plain and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. The closest is option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because all F2 would be either red-brown or plain-brown, not a mix where checkered is less frequent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. For example, Parent 1 could be CC BB (dominant for both), and Parent 2 could be cc Bb (recessive for c and dominant for B). Then, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be Cc Bb x Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotypic distribution as before.\n\nWait, but according to the user's initial description, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which makes all F2 have at least one dominant allele for both traits, thus all red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red and brown, which none of the options reflect. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the parents to be CC Bb and cc BB, leading to a different phenotypic ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the original assumption and see which option fits best. Since all F2 are red and brown, the phenotypic ratio should reflect that. But none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 14% red and brown (checkered) and 30% plain and brown (plain), which doesn't align with our expectation.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the question expects us to consider that only one dominant allele is needed, but that would be incorrect in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to a different phenotypic outcome in F2. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc Bb:\n\n- F1: Cc Bb\n- F2: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nGametes from F1: Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb (each 25%).\n\nPhenotypes in F2:\n\n1. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n2. Cc bb \u2192 C (red), b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n3. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain), B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 c (plain), b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio remains 25% each, leading to 100% red and brown, 0% plain and brown, etc. None of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Maybe Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc Bb, as previously thought. Then, F1 is Cc Bb, and F2 is Cc Bb x Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotypic distribution.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer intended is option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only one dominant allele is needed, but that would ignore the recessive conditions.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the question refers to dihybrid ratios under certain assumptions, such as ignoring dominance, but that would lead to a different outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 ratio. Let me compute it properly.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nF1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nPossible gametes from Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n\nPossible gametes from Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the Punnett square would have:\n\nCc * Cc: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc\n\nBb * Bb: 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining the two, the F2 would be:\n\nCC BB (25%)\n\nCC Bb (25%)\n\nCC bb (25%) \u2013 Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so each cell combines a Cc gamete with a Bb gamete.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird contributes either Cc or Bb gametes. Therefore, the F2 will be combinations of Cc and Bb.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n        | Cc    | c\n      -----------------\n      Cc     | CC   | Cc\n      Bb     | Cc   | bb\n      -----------------\n      bb      | cc   | bb\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The actual Punnett square would have each gamete from the first parent contributing a Cc or Bb allele, and each gamete from the second parent contributing a Cc or Bb allele. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that's nine genotypes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. For each gene, the probability of C being present is 75% (since C is dominant) and c is 25%, while B is 75% (B dominant) and b is 25%. Wait, no\u2014that's if the parents were heterozygotes. In our case, the parents are homozygous for both genes. Parent 1 is CC BB, so C is always dominant, and B is always dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so c is always recessive, and b is always recessive. Therefore, all the offspring will inherit either the dominant or recessive alleles for each gene. Specifically:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- All offspring will have at least one C allele because both parents are CC. Therefore, all offspring will have pigment (red). Only the c allele would lead to plain.\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- Both parents are BB and bb respectively, so all offspring will get one B and one b allele. Therefore, all offspring will have brown color (since B is dominant).\n\nWait, hold on. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then when they mate, all the offspring will receive one C from Parent 1 and one c from Parent 2. Similarly, they'll receive one B from Parent 1 and one b from Parent 2. Therefore, all offspring will be Cc and Bb, resulting in all red and brown. That's interesting because typically, dihybrid crosses involve more complexity, like considering different genotypes leading to different phenotypes. But in this case, since both parents are homozygous for both genes, the offspring will always have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all offspring will display both traits as dominant. So the phenotypes for all F2 individuals would be red and brown. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means both alleles are dominant for pigment and both for color. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both are recessive. Therefore, any gamete from Parent 1 will carry CC, and any gamete from Parent 2 will carry cc. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so they can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so they can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) would produce CB and cb gametes in a 1:1 ratio. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 all red and brown\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 red and brown\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 same as above\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain and brown\n\nSo the F2 would consist of four types of birds: CC BB (all red and brown), CcBb (same), cc BB (plain and brown), and cc bb (plain and brown). But how many of each? Since each gamete is produced in a 1:1 ratio, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all red and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (red and brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain and brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain and brown)\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, none directly match this scenario. Wait, the options seem to suggest different phenotypic ratios. Let me see what the options say.\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to J):\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nHmm, in my earlier reasoning, all F2 birds would be either all red and brown or plain and brown. So the phenotypic ratio would be 75% red-brown and 25% plain-brown. Looking at option D, which states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with my previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question isn't assuming that both parents are homozygous for both genes. Let me reread the question. Ah, no\u2014the parents are homozygous for both genes: Parent 1 is CC BB, Parent 2 is cc bb. So indeed, all F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them all red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should reflect that all F2 are red-brown, except those without the dominant allele for B, which is the plain bird. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird would be red and brown regardless. So all F2 would be red and brown. But that contradicts some of the options, as all options seem to mix red and brown with plain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB (since checkered implies c, and red is dominant for pigment)\n- Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb (plain implies recessive c, brown implies dominant B)\n\nTherefore, all offspring will be CcBb, which results in all red and brown (since both genes are dominant in all offspring). Therefore, all F2 would be red and brown. But looking at the options, none seem to fit this exactly. Wait, but perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The phenotype depends on whether the dominant alleles are present.\n\nIn Parent 1 (CC BB):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n\n- c is recessive (plain)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nWhen crossed, all offspring will have Cc (from C and c) and Bb (from B and b). Therefore, all offspring will have pigment (red) and brown (since B is dominant), making them red and brown. Thus, all F2 are red-brown. However, looking at the options, none directly state that. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the parent genotypes.\n\nWait, the user provided the parents as:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, producing 25% CC BB, 25% CcBb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc Bb. But wait, in reality, since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio should consider the combinations of both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's re-examine the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, meaning both alleles are dominant for both traits. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive. Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb, which means all will have at least one dominant allele for both traits, resulting in red and brown. Thus, all F2 will also have at least one dominant allele for both, hence all red and brown.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this exact scenario. Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This suggests that some F2 might be plain and brown, implying that not all offspring have the dominant alleles for both traits.\n\nAh, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me look again:\n\nThe question says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both genes. Perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. So when crossed, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWait, but in this case, all F2 would be CcBb, which would express as red and brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant). Thus, all F2 would be red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% red and brown. But the options don't include such an option. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc Bb. That would make more sense because then the F1 would have mixed alleles, leading to varied phenotypes in the F2.\n\nLet me reevaluate. Suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and Parent 2 is cc Bb (heterozygous for B and recessive for b). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb. The F2 would result from crossing Cc Bb x Cc Bb. Now, let's calculate the phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B): dominant C \u2192 red; otherwise, plain.\n- Body color (B/b): dominant B \u2192 brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nThus, for each bird in F2, the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 red and brown.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 red and checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 plain and brown.\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc Bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb (from Cc and Bb). Then, F2 would be:\n\nPossible gametes from F1 (Cc Bb):\n\n- Cc Bb (with 25% chance)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014when you cross Cc Bb x Cc Bb, the possible gametes are:\n\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red; Body: B is dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n2. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment: C \u2192 red; Body: b \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n3. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment: c \u2192 plain; Body: B \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment: c \u2192 plain; Body: b \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Pheno A: red and brown \u2192 25%\n- Pheno B: red and checkered \u2192 25%\n- Pheno C: plain and brown \u2192 25%\n- Pheno D: plain and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. The closest is option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because all F2 would be either red-brown or plain-brown, not a mix where checkered is less frequent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. For example, Parent 1 could be CC BB (dominant for both), and Parent 2 could be cc Bb (recessive for c and dominant for B). Then, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be Cc Bb x Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotypic distribution as before.\n\nWait, but according to the user's initial description, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which makes all F2 have at least one dominant allele for both traits, thus all red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red and brown, which none of the options reflect. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the parents to be CC Bb and cc BB, leading to a different phenotypic ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the original assumption and see which option fits best. Since all F2 are red and brown, the phenotypic ratio should reflect that. But none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 14% red and brown (checkered) and 30% plain and brown (plain), which doesn't align with our expectation.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the question expects us to consider that only one dominant allele is needed, but that would be incorrect in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to a different phenotypic outcome in F2. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc Bb:\n\n- F1: Cc Bb\n- F2: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nGametes from F1: Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb (each 25%).\n\nPhenotypes in F2:\n\n1. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n2. Cc bb \u2192 C (red), b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n3. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain), B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 c (plain), b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio remains 25% each, leading to 100% red and brown, 0% plain and brown, etc. None of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Maybe Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc Bb, as previously thought. Then, F1 is Cc Bb, and F2 is Cc Bb x Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotypic distribution.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer intended is option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only one dominant allele is needed, but that would ignore the recessive conditions.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the question refers to dihybrid ratios under certain assumptions, such as ignoring dominance, but that would lead to a different outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 ratio. Let me compute it properly.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nF1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nPossible gametes from Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n\nPossible gametes from Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the Punnett square would have:\n\nCc * Cc: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc\n\nBb * Bb: 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining the two, the F2 would be:\n\nCC BB (25%)\n\nCC Bb (25%)\n\nCC bb (25%) \u2013 Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so each cell combines a Cc gamete with a Bb gamete.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird contributes either Cc or Bb gametes. Therefore, the F2 will be combinations of Cc and Bb.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n        | Cc    | c\n      -----------------\n      Cc     | CC   | Cc\n      Bb     | Cc   | bb\n      -----------------\n      bb      | cc   | bb\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect. The actual Punnett square would have each gamete from the first parent contributing a Cc or Bb allele, and each gamete from the second parent contributing a Cc or Bb allele. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that's nine genotypes. Now, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- CC bb \u2192 C (red), b (checkered) \u2192 red and checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 C (red), B",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (25%).",
    "rollout": " Given that the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: F2 is a dihybrid cross, so the possible phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene has two alleles, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the dominant trait is 3/4 (since for a dihybrid cross, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4). But since both genes determine different traits, we have to consider them together.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio for two independent traits is often represented as 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. In our case, since both genes are determining the same traits (pigeon color and body color), but each gene is acting independently, the phenotypic ratios for each trait are 3:1, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014let me think again. For a dihybrid cross, where each gene is dominant, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming that both genes are codominant. But in this case, since the genes are separate, the phenotypes combine the effects of both genes. Each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes could be any combination of the four possible combinations (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered). However, given the dominance hierarchy (C > c and B > b), the actual phenotypes might differ. Wait, no\u2014the dominance is separate for each gene. So for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment, regardless of the B allele. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. Plain (c present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. Plain (c present) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for the highest phenotype (Red-Brown), then 3/16 for the next category (Red-Checkered), another 3/16 for Plain-Brown, and 1/16 for Plain-Checkered. This comes from the binomial distribution where each gene contributes to the phenotype, and each has a 3/4 chance of being dominant, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. The correct approach is to compute the probability for each phenotype based on the combination of alleles from each gene. For example:\n\n- Red-Brown: Both C and B must be present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Red-Checkered: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain-Brown: C absent, B present. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain-Checkered: Both C and B absent. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red-Brown, Red-Checkered, Plain-Brown, Plain-Checkered respectively.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none directly match 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options:\n\nLooking at the options, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which corresponds to 1:3:9:3 ratio. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which is 3:9:1:3, also not matching. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which seems off. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which is 5:3:2:6\u2014not matching. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014nope. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\u2014also not matching. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014again, 9:3:3:1 scaled differently. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype definitions. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that checkered is determined by recessive alleles (cB?), but perhaps I got the letters wrong. Let me double-check: Gene C is C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Gene B is B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered). So a bird is checkered if it has the recessive alleles for both genes (cb). Otherwise, it's either red (CC or Cc), brown (BB or Bb), or plain (cc).\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has dominant alleles. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C (for pigment) and B (for color) present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 c present, B present.\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 c present, B absent.\n\nEach of these depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, in the F2 generation, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Probability of Pigment red AND Checkered (C present, B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of Plain (c present) AND Brown (B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of Plain AND Checkered = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which correspond to 9 parts for Pigment red and Brown, 3 for Pigment red and Checkered, 3 for Plain and Brown, and 1 for Plain and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nWait, that's 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. That makes sense if we were counting the number of each phenotype rather than their frequency. If the question asks for the count instead of the ratio, then option D would make sense. Let me check the original question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So they're asking for the ratio, not the counts. But among the options, none seem to match 9:3:3:1. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of the correct 9:3:3:1.\n\nIs there a possibility that I've misread the options? Let me check:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 12,2,2,0\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nK. 4,4,4,4\n\nL. 6,2,2,0\n\nM. 1,3,9,3\n\nN. 5,3,2,6\n\nO. 3,9,1,3\n\nP. 4,4,4,4\n\nQ. 12,2,2,0\n\nR. 5,3,2,6\n\nS. 7,5,1,3\n\nT. 2,6,3,1\n\nU. 4,4,4,4\n\nV. 6,2,2,0\n\nW. 3,9,1,3\n\nX. 5,3,2,6\n\nY. 7,5,1,3\n\nZ. 2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, I don't see 9:3:3:1 in the options. But option D presents 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse. Perhaps the question is asking for the count rather than the ratio, but that's unlikely given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the definition of the phenotypes. Let me reconsider: perhaps the colors are being considered separately, and the checkered status is part of the color. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is determined by recessive alleles (cB?), but I think I interpreted that correctly earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Let me try another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D, assuming that the user intended to ask for counts instead of ratios. But according to the question, it's the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- For Pigment red and Checkered: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- For Plain and Brown: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- For Plain and Checkered: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the options present this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nWhich one matches the correct 9:3:3:1? None do. However, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since it's multiple-choice, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio as the number of each phenotype, not the frequency. For instance, if the bird with pigmented red and brown is considered one phenotype, and others similarly, but the counts add up to 16. But that would mean option D is correct if it's referring to counts, but the question clearly asks for ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be generated by selfing F1. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nC | c\n---|---\nB | \nB | \nb | \n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all possible combinations. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are Cc and Bb, then each gamete has a 25% chance of each type. So the F2 will have 16 possible combinations. Let's categorize them into phenotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Red-Brown\n4.

Clearly, I'm making a mistake in enumeration. Let me correct this.\n\nActually, each of the 16 combinations should be evaluated:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n4. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n5. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n7. cb + cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n10. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n11. cB + cB \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n12. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n13. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n14. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n15. cB + cB \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n16. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1,2,3,4,9,10,12,16 \u2192 8 cases\n- Plain-Brown: Cases 5,6,7,8,11,13,14,15 \u2192 8 cases\n- Red-Checkered: Case 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain-Checkered: Cases 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nThis still totals 8+8+1+1=18, which is incorrect. I must be misunderstanding how to count. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. According to the standard dihybrid cross results, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So unless the options are presented incorrectly, perhaps the intended correct answer is not listed. But since the user expects a choice, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, and none of the options match exactly. However, option D is the closest if it's 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the counts, and option E is 3:9:1:3, which might not align.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement again. It says the dihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They want the F2 phenotypic ratio. My conclusion is that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. However, the closest is option D (1:3:9:3) or option E (3:9:1:3). But neither matches the correct 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct answer intended is option D, despite the ratio being inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses a different system where each trait is expressed based on dominant alleles, but the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: F2 is a dihybrid cross, so the possible phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene has two alleles, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the dominant trait is 3/4 (since for a dihybrid cross, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4). But since both genes determine different traits, we have to consider them together.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio for two independent traits is often represented as 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. In our case, since both genes are determining the same traits (pigeon color and body color), but each gene is acting independently, the phenotypic ratios for each trait are 3:1, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014let me think again. For a dihybrid cross, where each gene is dominant, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming that both genes are codominant. But in this case, since the genes are separate, the phenotypes combine the effects of both genes. Each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes could be any combination of the four possible combinations (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered). However, given the dominance hierarchy (C > c and B > b), the actual phenotypes might differ. Wait, no\u2014the dominance is separate for each gene. So for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment, regardless of the B allele. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. Plain (c present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. Plain (c present) and body checkered (B absent) \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for the highest phenotype (Red-Brown), then 3/16 for the next category (Red-Checkered), another 3/16 for Plain-Brown, and 1/16 for Plain-Checkered. This comes from the binomial distribution where each gene contributes to the phenotype, and each has a 3/4 chance of being dominant, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. The correct approach is to compute the probability for each phenotype based on the combination of alleles from each gene. For example:\n\n- Red-Brown: Both C and B must be present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Red-Checkered: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain-Brown: C absent, B present. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain-Checkered: Both C and B absent. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Red-Brown, Red-Checkered, Plain-Brown, Plain-Checkered respectively.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none directly match 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options:\n\nLooking at the options, option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which corresponds to 1:3:9:3 ratio. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which is 3:9:1:3, also not matching. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which seems off. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which is 5:3:2:6\u2014not matching. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014nope. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\u2014also not matching. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014again, 9:3:3:1 scaled differently. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype definitions. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that checkered is determined by recessive alleles (cB?), but perhaps I got the letters wrong. Let me double-check: Gene C is C (dominant, red) and c (recessive, plain). Gene B is B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered). So a bird is checkered if it has the recessive alleles for both genes (cb). Otherwise, it's either red (CC or Cc), brown (BB or Bb), or plain (cc).\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has dominant alleles. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C (for pigment) and B (for color) present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 c present, B present.\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 c present, B absent.\n\nEach of these depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, in the F2 generation, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Probability of Pigment red AND Checkered (C present, B absent) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of Plain (c present) AND Brown (B present) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Probability of Plain AND Checkered = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which correspond to 9 parts for Pigment red and Brown, 3 for Pigment red and Checkered, 3 for Plain and Brown, and 1 for Plain and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nWait, that's 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. That makes sense if we were counting the number of each phenotype rather than their frequency. If the question asks for the count instead of the ratio, then option D would make sense. Let me check the original question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So they're asking for the ratio, not the counts. But among the options, none seem to match 9:3:3:1. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of the correct 9:3:3:1.\n\nIs there a possibility that I've misread the options? Let me check:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 12,2,2,0\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nK. 4,4,4,4\n\nL. 6,2,2,0\n\nM. 1,3,9,3\n\nN. 5,3,2,6\n\nO. 3,9,1,3\n\nP. 4,4,4,4\n\nQ. 12,2,2,0\n\nR. 5,3,2,6\n\nS. 7,5,1,3\n\nT. 2,6,3,1\n\nU. 4,4,4,4\n\nV. 6,2,2,0\n\nW. 3,9,1,3\n\nX. 5,3,2,6\n\nY. 7,5,1,3\n\nZ. 2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, I don't see 9:3:3:1 in the options. But option D presents 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse. Perhaps the question is asking for the count rather than the ratio, but that's unlikely given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the definition of the phenotypes. Let me reconsider: perhaps the colors are being considered separately, and the checkered status is part of the color. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that checkered is determined by recessive alleles (cB?), but I think I interpreted that correctly earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Let me try another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D, assuming that the user intended to ask for counts instead of ratios. But according to the question, it's the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- For Pigment red and Checkered: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- For Plain and Brown: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- For Plain and Checkered: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16, which checks out. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the options present this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nWhich one matches the correct 9:3:3:1? None do. However, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since it's multiple-choice, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio as the number of each phenotype, not the frequency. For instance, if the bird with pigmented red and brown is considered one phenotype, and others similarly, but the counts add up to 16. But that would mean option D is correct if it's referring to counts, but the question clearly asks for ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be generated by selfing F1. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nC | c\n---|---\nB | \nB | \nb | \n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all possible combinations. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are Cc and Bb, then each gamete has a 25% chance of each type. So the F2 will have 16 possible combinations. Let's categorize them into phenotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Red-Brown\n4.

Clearly, I'm making a mistake in enumeration. Let me correct this.\n\nActually, each of the 16 combinations should be evaluated:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n4.

I must be misunderstanding how to count. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. According to the standard dihybrid cross results, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So unless the options are presented incorrectly, perhaps the intended correct answer is not listed. But since the user expects a choice, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, and none of the options match exactly. However, option D is the closest if it's 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the counts, and option E is 3:9:1:3, which might not align.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement again. It says the dihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They want the F2 phenotypic ratio. My conclusion is that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. However, the closest is option D (1:3:9:3) or option E (3:9:1:3). But neither matches the correct 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct answer intended is option D, despite the ratio being inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses a different system where each trait is expressed based on dominant alleles, but the",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " So for each gene:\n\nGene C: \n- C : c = 3:1 (since C is dominant)\n\nGene B: \n- B : b = 3:1\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. That is, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for the actual count, not the ratio. Actually, the number of each phenotype depends on how many combinations meet the criteria.\n\nLet me list the phenotypes and calculate the counts:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n- Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the total number of phenotypes would be in the ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, the options given don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios like 6:2:2:0, etc. Wait, none of them seems to fit 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross. The standard dihybrid cross (F2) for two linked genes typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but if the genes are not linked, the ratio would be different. In this case, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So during crossing over, since both parents are homozygous, any recombination would be impossible. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would inherit from this without any recombination. So the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer choices, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is another way of writing the same ratio, but scaled differently. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly match this. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies that the dominant alleles express their traits fully. So let me recalculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual counts.\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the number of possible phenotypes is 4: Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, Plain and checkered.\n\nThe counts for each phenotypic group in F2 would be based on the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16 of all F2 individuals\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2013 This is a different ratio, possibly if the parents were different. If the parents were, say, AaBb x AaBb, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But our parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the answer choices. Let me try recalculating the possible phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nIf the F2 generation consists of 16 individuals, with 9 having Pigment red and brown, 3 having Pigment red and checkered, 3 having Plain and brown, and 1 having Plain and checkered. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user intended the ratio as 6:2:6:2, which could come from a different scenario, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 9:3:3:1 reversed. Option J suggests 2:6:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option B has 6:2:6:2, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio when divided by 1.5 (since 9 \u00f7 1.5 = 6, etc.). So option B: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering that the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of order. Wait, but in reality, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't exactly reflected in option B. However, option B presents the ratio as 6:2:6:2, which simplifies the 9:3:3:1 ratio by dividing each term by 1.5. So perhaps the answer is B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So for each gene:\n\nGene C: \n- C : c = 3:1 (since C is dominant)\n\nGene B: \n- B : b = 3:1\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. That is, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for the actual count, not the ratio. Actually, the number of each phenotype depends on how many combinations meet the criteria.\n\nLet me list the phenotypes and calculate the counts:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n- Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the total number of phenotypes would be in the ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, the options given don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios like 6:2:2:0, etc. Wait, none of them seems to fit 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross. The standard dihybrid cross (F2) for two linked genes typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but if the genes are not linked, the ratio would be different. In this case, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So during crossing over, since both parents are homozygous, any recombination would be impossible. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would inherit from this without any recombination. So the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking at the answer choices, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't match. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is another way of writing the same ratio, but scaled differently. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly match this. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies that the dominant alleles express their traits fully. So let me recalculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual counts.\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the number of possible phenotypes is 4: Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, Plain and checkered.\n\nThe counts for each phenotypic group in F2 would be based on the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16 of all F2 individuals\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2013 This is a different ratio, possibly if the parents were different. If the parents were, say, AaBb x AaBb, then the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But our parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the answer choices. Let me try recalculating the possible phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nIf the F2 generation consists of 16 individuals, with 9 having Pigment red and brown, 3 having Pigment red and checkered, 3 having Plain and brown, and 1 having Plain and checkered. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user intended the ratio as 6:2:6:2, which could come from a different scenario, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 9:3:3:1 reversed. Option J suggests 2:6:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option B has 6:2:6:2, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio when divided by 1.5 (since 9 \u00f7 1.5 = 6, etc.). So option B: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering that the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of order. Wait, but in reality, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't exactly reflected in option B. However, option B presents the ratio as 6:2:6:2, which simplifies the 9:3:3:1 ratio by dividing each term by 1.5. So perhaps the answer is B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

C absent, B present: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (plain and brown)\n4. Both C and B absent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (plain and checkered)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when scaled up by 16 (to eliminate decimals).\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios.

Each part being 1/16. Wait, this matches our calculation.\nWait, but option C says 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes with counts proportional to 9,3,3,1 respectively. That would mean each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, etc. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype is 1/4, which is 4/16 each. So why is option C matching? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, I made a mistake earlier. Because each gene has two alleles, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc for each gene. But when considering both genes together, the number of phenotypic classes depends on how many dominant alleles each bird has for each trait. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether the dominant alleles are present for each trait. \n\nBut another approach is to consider the possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined separately by a single gene, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1 for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Thus, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, but scaled appropriately based on the actual numbers of individuals.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none directly correspond to 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, which makes sense because 4^2=16. But according to my previous reasoning, each phenotype would be 4/16 each, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that the parents are homozygous for both genes. That is, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be formed by selfing F1. The F2 would have possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C gene (pigment):\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B gene (color):\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply. So for example, the probability of having C dominant (C) and B dominant (B) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Similarly for the others.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, as each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes would result in a distinct phenotype. Therefore, the F2 would have 16 birds, with 4 of each phenotype. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, but looking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which also sums to 16. Option C is \"9:3:3:1,\" which would imply each phenotype is represented 9,3,3,1 times respectively, totaling 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the issue is that the genes don't work independently because they share the same locus. Wait, no, they're different genes, so they should assort independently. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for pigment color (C) and body color (B):\n\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B): red and brown\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b): red and checkered\n- If c (plain) is dominant (c) and B is dominant (B): plain and brown\n- If c (plain) is dominant (c) and B is recessive (b): plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for each combination. So each phenotype occurs 25% of the time in F2. Therefore, in a group of 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But the options don't reflect this. Instead, option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which totals 16, but the ratio is 9:3:3:1, implying that checkered red (which would be the case where C is dominant and B is recessive) occurs 9/16, whereas checkered brown (C dominant, B dominant) is 3/16, plain red (c dominant, B recessive) is 3/16, and plain brown (c dominant, B dominant) is 1/16. That contradicts what I thought before.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let's clarify:\n\nIf each bird must have at least one dominant allele for both genes to express the corresponding phenotype, then:\n\n- Checkered red: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Cb\n- Checkered brown: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 CB\n- Plain red: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 cb\n- Plain brown: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 cc\n\nIn terms of the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by these combinations. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each type of bird in the F2.\n\nGiven that each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. Therefore, in a sample of 16 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1 ratios. Instead, option C has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which suggests that the count is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. That implies that checkered red (CB) is 9/16, checkered brown (CB) is 3/16, plain red (cb) is 3/16, and plain brown (cc) is 1/16. This would happen if the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the genetic loci. Another possibility is that the presence of the recessive allele for one gene masks the effect of the other. For example, if the C gene's effect is only visible if the B gene is dominant, then the phenotypic ratio could change. But that's not stated in the problem. So I'll proceed under the assumption that both genes are working independently, leading to four phenotypes with equal representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options reflect this, I must reevaluate. Looking back at the options, option C states a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which is typical for two linked genes, but in this case, the genes are independent, so this shouldn't apply unless there's linkage. Therefore, I must conclude that option C is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of birds with each phenotype. Let me recalculate the number of birds for each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by selfing F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Assuming equal segregation (25% each), the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBB\n- 25% ccbb\n\nBut when considering the phenotypes, each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CcBb: Pigment red (C), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n3. ccBB: Pigment plain (c), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. ccbb: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So in CcBb:\n\n- Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red\n- Body: B is dominant \u2192 brown\nSo phenotype is checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, for each bird:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 checkered red\n- ccBB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- ccbb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CC BB and CcBb)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from ccBB)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from ccbb)\n- Plain red: 25% (from ccBB and ccbb)\n\nThis adds up to 100%, but since the options don't reflect this, I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the genes aren't independent. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves incomplete dominance or something else.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: It mentions that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). The checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'b' in the B gene, and the plain is due to 'c'. Pigmentation is due to the C gene. So, if a bird is heterozygous for either gene, their phenotype is intermediate. But the problem states that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So when these are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfed would lead to F2.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have four phenotypes each occurring 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided don't include this ratio. Option C has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which suggests that the presence of dominant alleles for one gene affects the expression of the other. But without any indication of linkage or epistasis, this scenario should not hold.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me consider that the presence of dominant alleles for one gene may mask the effect of the other. For instance, if the B gene's expression is dependent on the presence of the dominant C allele, then the phenotypes would change accordingly.\n\nAssuming that:\n\n- B is expressed only if C is dominant. So, if C is present (C_), then B is expressed. Otherwise, B is not expressed.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C dominant (C_) and B dominant (B_) \u2192 checkered red\n- C dominant (C_) and B recessive (b_) \u2192 checkered brown\n- c (plain) dominant (c_), regardless of B \u2192 plain brown\n- c (plain) recessive (c_), regardless of B \u2192 plain red\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: C_ (which includes cB and CB)\n  - C_ and B_: 25%\n  - C_ and b_: 25%\n- Checkered brown: C_ and b_\n  - 25%\n- Plain brown: c_ and B_: 25%\n- Plain red: c_ and b_: 25%\n\nBut this doesn't explain the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if the B gene's expression is independent, but influenced by the presence of C, the phenotypic ratios would still be 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the B gene's expression is independent of the C gene's expression, leading to four phenotypes with equal distribution. In that case, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore linkage and assume independent assortment, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But this would require that the B gene is influenced by the C gene, such as through epistasis or codominance. Without such details, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which adds up to 16, following a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting that the B gene is expressed only when C is present. For example, if B is expressed only when C is dominant, then:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is expressed \u2192 checkered red\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is not expressed \u2192 checkered brown\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is always expressed \u2192 plain brown\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is never expressed \u2192 plain red\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C dominant (C_) and B dominant (B_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C dominant (C_) and B recessive (b_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C recessive (cc) and B dominant (B_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C recessive (cc) and B recessive (b_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nBut this still results in four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, I'm concluding that the problem expects us to treat the B gene as influencing the presence of the C gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Thus, the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene is segregating independently, the combined ratios would be (prob C) * (prob B) : (prob C)*(prob b) : (prob c)*(prob B) : (prob c)*(prob b). Each probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 for each gene. So:\n\n- C dominant (C) and B dominant (B): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 red and brown\n- C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 red and checkered\n- c (plain) dominant (c) and B dominant (B): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 plain and brown\n- c (plain) dominant (c) and B recessive (b): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often. However, looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 doesn't make sense because each phenotype is 1/4 of the population.\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2013 Hmm, seems like some phenotypes might be zero, which isn't the case here.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This adds up to 16 parts, which aligns with 4^2=16. Each part being 1/16. Wait, this matches our calculation.\nWait, but option C says 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes with counts proportional to 9,3,3,1 respectively. That would mean each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, etc. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype is 1/4, which is 4/16 each. So why is option C matching? Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, I made a mistake earlier. Because each gene has two alleles, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc for each gene. But when considering both genes together, the number of phenotypic classes depends on how many dominant alleles each bird has for each trait. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether the dominant alleles are present for each trait. \n\nBut another approach is to consider the possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined separately by a single gene, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1 for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Thus, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, but scaled appropriately based on the actual numbers of individuals.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none directly correspond to 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, which makes sense because 4^2=16. But according to my previous reasoning, each phenotype would be 4/16 each, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that the parents are homozygous for both genes. That is, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be formed by selfing F1. The F2 would have possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C gene (pigment):\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B gene (color):\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply. So for example, the probability of having C dominant (C) and B dominant (B) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Similarly for the others.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, as each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes would result in a distinct phenotype. Therefore, the F2 would have 16 birds, with 4 of each phenotype. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, but looking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which also sums to 16. Option C is \"9:3:3:1,\" which would imply each phenotype is represented 9,3,3,1 times respectively, totaling 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the issue is that the genes don't work independently because they share the same locus. Wait, no, they're different genes, so they should assort independently. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for pigment color (C) and body color (B):\n\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B): red and brown\n- If C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b): red and checkered\n- If c (plain) is dominant (c) and B is dominant (B): plain and brown\n- If c (plain) is dominant (c) and B is recessive (b): plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for each combination. So each phenotype occurs 25% of the time in F2. Therefore, in a group of 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But the options don't reflect this. Instead, option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which totals 16, but the ratio is 9:3:3:1, implying that checkered red (which would be the case where C is dominant and B is recessive) occurs 9/16, whereas checkered brown (C dominant, B dominant) is 3/16, plain red (c dominant, B recessive) is 3/16, and plain brown (c dominant, B dominant) is 1/16. That contradicts what I thought before.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let's clarify:\n\nIf each bird must have at least one dominant allele for both genes to express the corresponding phenotype, then:\n\n- Checkered red: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Cb\n- Checkered brown: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 CB\n- Plain red: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 cb\n- Plain brown: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 cc\n\nIn terms of the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by these combinations. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each type of bird in the F2.\n\nGiven that each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. Therefore, in a sample of 16 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1 ratios. Instead, option C has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which suggests that the count is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16. That implies that checkered red (CB) is 9/16, checkered brown (CB) is 3/16, plain red (cb) is 3/16, and plain brown (cc) is 1/16. This would happen if the presence of dominant alleles for both genes leads to certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the genetic loci. Another possibility is that the presence of the recessive allele for one gene masks the effect of the other. For example, if the C gene's effect is only visible if the B gene is dominant, then the phenotypic ratio could change. But that's not stated in the problem. So I'll proceed under the assumption that both genes are working independently, leading to four phenotypes with equal representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options reflect this, I must reevaluate. Looking back at the options, option C states a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which is typical for two linked genes, but in this case, the genes are independent, so this shouldn't apply unless there's linkage. Therefore, I must conclude that option C is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of birds with each phenotype. Let me recalculate the number of birds for each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by selfing F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Assuming equal segregation (25% each), the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBB\n- 25% ccbb\n\nBut when considering the phenotypes, each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. CcBb: Pigment red (C), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n3. ccBB: Pigment plain (c), Body brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. ccbb: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So in CcBb:\n\n- Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red\n- Body: B is dominant \u2192 brown\nSo phenotype is checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, for each bird:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 checkered red\n- ccBB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- ccbb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (from CC BB and CcBb)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (from ccBB)\n- Plain brown: 25% (from ccbb)\n- Plain red: 25% (from ccBB and ccbb)\n\nThis adds up to 100%, but since the options don't reflect this, I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the genes aren't independent. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves incomplete dominance or something else.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: It mentions that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). The checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'b' in the B gene, and the plain is due to 'c'. Pigmentation is due to the C gene. So, if a bird is heterozygous for either gene, their phenotype is intermediate. But the problem states that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So when these are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfed would lead to F2.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have four phenotypes each occurring 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1.

But without any indication of linkage or epistasis, this scenario should not hold.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Which adds up to 16, following a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting that the B gene is expressed only when C is present. For example, if B is expressed only when C is dominant, then:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is expressed \u2192 checkered red\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is not expressed \u2192 checkered brown\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is always expressed \u2192 plain brown\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is never expressed \u2192 plain red\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C dominant (C_) and B dominant (B_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C dominant (C_) and B recessive (b_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C recessive (cc) and B dominant (B_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n- C recessive (cc) and B recessive (b_): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nBut this still results in four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, I'm concluding that the problem expects us to treat the B gene as influencing the presence of the C gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Thus, the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.",
    "rollout": " Given that both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo let's compute the probabilities for each bird:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of c (recessive): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive): 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. The four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25%\n2. C dominant, b (checkered): 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%\n3. c dominant, B (brown): 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75%\n4. c dominant, b (plain): 0.25 * 0.25 = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap in terms of phenotypes. For example, if C and B are both dominant, the bird would be red and brown. If C is dominant and B is recessive, it's red and checkered. Similarly for the others. So the phenotypic ratios would be 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. Adding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. That makes sense.\n\nNow, translating these percentages into ratios: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25: \n\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to the classic Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Not matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. Option E has 3,9,1,3. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions \"checkered\" as one phenotype, \"plain\" as another, \"red\" as another, and \"brown\" as the last. But according to the genetic analysis, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. However, the problem might be simplifying it to four phenotypes rather than four combinations. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes, but the way the options are presented might require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of each type of genotype directly instead of using phenotypic ratios. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that adds up to 12, which isn't the same as 100. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem wants the count of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype, without converting to phenotypic ratios. Let me try that approach.\n\nGiven the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype. The F2 population consists of four types of birds:\n\n1. CC BB: All checkered, red\n2. CC bb: All checkered, brown\n3. cc BB: All plain, red\n4. cc bb: All plain, brown\n\nBut based on the parents being CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the dihybrid cross. In a standard dihybrid cross, the expected counts for each genotype are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nIf we convert these to phenotypes, considering that:\n\n- CC (any color) \u2192 checkered, regardless of B\n- cc \u2192 plain, regardless of B\n- BB \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that's not what any of the options seem to present. Looking back, the options don't have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they have various numbers like 2,6,3,1. Maybe the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation rather than the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have 9 genotypes. Since each parent is crossed to produce 25% of each genotype, the F2 will have 4 types. However, the question might be expecting the count of each phenotype, not the ratio. Let's calculate how many of each phenotype there are in the F2.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to the phenotype. So for each bird, if it's CC BB, it's checkered red. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown. cc BB \u2192 plain red. cc bb \u2192 plain brown. Assuming a large population, the number of each phenotype would be approximately 25% each. However, since the options provide specific numbers (like 1,3,2,6), perhaps we need to consider the actual counts based on the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, the question mentions showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So perhaps the answer involves calculating the phenotypic distribution based on the genotypic frequencies.\n\nLet me approach this methodically. First, determine the genotypic ratios for the F2 generation. As established earlier, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc bb. Now, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, each of these genotypes maps directly to a phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. However, none of the options provided reflect this exact ratio. Instead, the options list different numerical values. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the count of each phenotype in terms of the number of individuals rather than their frequency.\n\nAssuming a large population where each bird is randomly assigned a genotype, the expected count of each phenotype would be proportional to the number of each genotype. Since each genotype accounts for 25% of the population, and each has a unique phenotype, the expected counts would be roughly equal. But again, this doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual counts in a sample without assuming a large population. For instance, if the parents are crossed to produce 100 birds, then each genotype would occur 25 times, leading to 25 checkered red, 25 checkered brown, 25 plain red, and 25 plain brown birds. However, none of the options match this exact distribution either.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. These add up to 12, which is less than 100. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype within a subset of the F2 generation, such as the 16 birds produced by a dihybrid cross, which includes all four phenotypes with counts 4,4,4,4. But that still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup. The question mentions that the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the cross of F1 x F1. Therefore, the F2 would include all possible genotypes from the F1 parents. As previously determined, the F2 genotypes would be 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc bb. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often.\n\nHowever, the options do not reflect this. Instead, they have varying counts. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is intended to use the concept of dihybrid crosses and expect the student to identify the correct ratio based on the products of the Punnett square. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the actual number of each phenotype in a larger context, such as the number of each genotype contributing to the phenotype.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. For each bird, if both dominant alleles are present (either C and B, or C and b, c and B), then the bird is either red or brown. If only one dominant allele is present, it could be either checkered or plain. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio without worrying about the actual counts beyond identifying the correct ratio among the options. Looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but this is not reflected in any of the options. The closest is option G: 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 100. Option H: 5,3,2,6 also sums to 16, which is too low. Option F: 4,4,4,4 sums to 16, which is incorrect. Option D: 1,3,9,3 sums to 16, also incorrect. Option C: 9,3,3,1 sums to 16. None of these add up to 100 except for option G and H, which are invalid.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question is not asking for the correct ratio but rather the actual counts based on the dihybrid cross. Let me recast the dihybrid cross outcome for a larger population. For example, if there are 16 birds, each genotype would occur once, resulting in four phenotypes, each appearing once. But this doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of possible phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's about counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without considering the frequency, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses a different system where the checkered phenotype is considered as one category and the others as separate. For example, perhaps \"checkered\" and \"plain\" are grouped together, reducing the phenotypic ratio. But that would change the interpretation significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the concepts of dihybrid ratios and actual counts. Let me try to calculate the expected number of each phenotype based on the dihybrid cross. Since the F2 generation is a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes (CC BB and cc bb), the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but scaled according to the possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not reflect this. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 100. Option H: 5,3,2,6 also doesn't add up. Option F: 4,4,4,4 adds up to 16, which is too small. Option C: 9,3,3,1 adds to 16 as well. None of these seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not accounting for all possible phenotypes but is focusing on the number of each phenotype in a subset of the F2 generation. For example, if considering only the checkered and plain phenotypes, ignoring the brown and red ones, the ratio would be 9:3 (since 9 checkered and 3 plain). But that would correspond to option C: 9,3,3,1, but excluding the brown and red parts. However, this interpretation might not align with the question's intent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presenting the options, or I'm misunderstanding the setup. Another thought: perhaps the question refers to the dihybrid cross as producing a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but when considering the actual number of each phenotype, it's represented differently. For example, in a sample of 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But that still doesn't fit the options.\n\nAt this point, I realize that perhaps the problem is intended to recognize that the dihybrid cross results in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but the options provided don't reflect this. However, the closest option is option G: 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't make sense because it implies zero plain red. Option C: 9,3,3,1 adds up to 16, which might represent a smaller sample size. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each genotype in the F2 generation. If each parent produces 25% of each genotype, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these has a unique phenotype. Therefore, the number of each phenotype in the F2 would be equal if the population is large enough. However, the options provided don't include equal counts. Instead, they vary widely.\n\nPerhaps the question is mistakenly providing the options in a non-standard way, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Given that, I'll proceed to choose the option that best fits the expected phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross, even though it doesn't perfectly align with the given choices. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the understanding that each of the four possible genotypes results in one phenotype, thus giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect this.\n\nUpon reflection, the most accurate phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross is 1:1:1:1. However, since none of the options present this, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I understood it correctly.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, along with the expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc. Given that, the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is testing knowledge of dihybrid ratios, and the intended answer is option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype in a subset of the F2 generation, such as the 16 birds produced by a dihybrid cross, each having a unique phenotype, which would result in 4 of each phenotype. But this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy, where only certain alleles contribute to the phenotype. For example, if B is required for brown, and b is for plain, and similarly, C is required for red, while c is for checkered. But the problem states that B is dominant for brown and recessive for checkered, implying that B is needed to express brownness, and b expresses plain. Similarly, C is dominant for red and recessive for checkered. So, in this case, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these has a unique phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 also sums to 16. Perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, grouping checkered and plain as one category and brown as another, but that changes the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options fit.\n\nGiven this confusion, I might have to select the option that best represents the dihybrid cross ratio, even if it's not perfect, but considering that option G sums to 12+2+2+0=16, which is less than 100, and perhaps the question is considering a smaller sample or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the actual number of each genotype, which would be 25% for each genotype.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo let's compute the probabilities for each bird:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of c (recessive): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive): 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. The four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25%\n2. C dominant, b (checkered): 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%\n3. c dominant, B (brown): 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75%\n4. c dominant, b (plain): 0.25 * 0.25 = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap in terms of phenotypes. For example, if C and B are both dominant, the bird would be red and brown. If C is dominant and B is recessive, it's red and checkered. Similarly for the others. So the phenotypic ratios would be 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. Adding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. That makes sense.\n\nNow, translating these percentages into ratios: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25: \n\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to the classic Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio. Now, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Not matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. Option E has 3,9,1,3. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions \"checkered\" as one phenotype, \"plain\" as another, \"red\" as another, and \"brown\" as the last. But according to the genetic analysis, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. However, the problem might be simplifying it to four phenotypes rather than four combinations. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes, but the way the options are presented might require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of each type of genotype directly instead of using phenotypic ratios. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that adds up to 12, which isn't the same as 100. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem wants the count of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype, without converting to phenotypic ratios. Let me try that approach.\n\nGiven the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype. The F2 population consists of four types of birds:\n\n1. CC BB: All checkered, red\n2. CC bb: All checkered, brown\n3. cc BB: All plain, red\n4. cc bb: All plain, brown\n\nBut based on the parents being CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the dihybrid cross. In a standard dihybrid cross, the expected counts for each genotype are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nIf we convert these to phenotypes, considering that:\n\n- CC (any color) \u2192 checkered, regardless of B\n- cc \u2192 plain, regardless of B\n- BB \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that's not what any of the options seem to present. Looking back, the options don't have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, they have various numbers like 2,6,3,1. Maybe the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation rather than the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have 9 genotypes. Since each parent is crossed to produce 25% of each genotype, the F2 will have 4 types. However, the question might be expecting the count of each phenotype, not the ratio. Let's calculate how many of each phenotype there are in the F2.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to the phenotype. So for each bird, if it's CC BB, it's checkered red. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown. cc BB \u2192 plain red. cc bb \u2192 plain brown. Assuming a large population, the number of each phenotype would be approximately 25% each. However, since the options provide specific numbers (like 1,3,2,6), perhaps we need to consider the actual counts based on the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, the question mentions showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So perhaps the answer involves calculating the phenotypic distribution based on the genotypic frequencies.\n\nLet me approach this methodically. First, determine the genotypic ratios for the F2 generation. As established earlier, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc bb. Now, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, each of these genotypes maps directly to a phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. However, none of the options provided reflect this exact ratio. Instead, the options list different numerical values. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the count of each phenotype in terms of the number of individuals rather than their frequency.\n\nAssuming a large population where each bird is randomly assigned a genotype, the expected count of each phenotype would be proportional to the number of each genotype. Since each genotype accounts for 25% of the population, and each has a unique phenotype, the expected counts would be roughly equal. But again, this doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual counts in a sample without assuming a large population. For instance, if the parents are crossed to produce 100 birds, then each genotype would occur 25 times, leading to 25 checkered red, 25 checkered brown, 25 plain red, and 25 plain brown birds. However, none of the options match this exact distribution either.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. These add up to 12, which is less than 100. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype within a subset of the F2 generation, such as the 16 birds produced by a dihybrid cross, which includes all four phenotypes with counts 4,4,4,4. But that still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup. The question mentions that the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the cross of F1 x F1. Therefore, the F2 would include all possible genotypes from the F1 parents. As previously determined, the F2 genotypes would be 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc bb. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often.\n\nHowever, the options do not reflect this. Instead, they have varying counts. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is intended to use the concept of dihybrid crosses and expect the student to identify the correct ratio based on the products of the Punnett square. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the actual number of each phenotype in a larger context, such as the number of each genotype contributing to the phenotype.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. For each bird, if both dominant alleles are present (either C and B, or C and b, c and B), then the bird is either red or brown. If only one dominant allele is present, it could be either checkered or plain. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio without worrying about the actual counts beyond identifying the correct ratio among the options. Looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nFrom my earlier analysis, the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but this is not reflected in any of the options. The closest is option G: 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 100. Option H: 5,3,2,6 also sums to 16, which is too low. Option F: 4,4,4,4 sums to 16, which is incorrect. Option D: 1,3,9,3 sums to 16, also incorrect. Option C: 9,3,3,1 sums to 16. None of these add up to 100 except for option G and H, which are invalid.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question is not asking for the correct ratio but rather the actual counts based on the dihybrid cross. Let me recast the dihybrid cross outcome for a larger population. For example, if there are 16 birds, each genotype would occur once, resulting in four phenotypes, each appearing once. But this doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of possible phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question and it's about counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without considering the frequency, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses a different system where the checkered phenotype is considered as one category and the others as separate. For example, perhaps \"checkered\" and \"plain\" are grouped together, reducing the phenotypic ratio. But that would change the interpretation significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the concepts of dihybrid ratios and actual counts. Let me try to calculate the expected number of each phenotype based on the dihybrid cross. Since the F2 generation is a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes (CC BB and cc bb), the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but scaled according to the possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not reflect this. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 100. Option H: 5,3,2,6 also doesn't add up. Option F: 4,4,4,4 adds up to 16, which is too small. Option C: 9,3,3,1 adds to 16 as well. None of these seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not accounting for all possible phenotypes but is focusing on the number of each phenotype in a subset of the F2 generation. For example, if considering only the checkered and plain phenotypes, ignoring the brown and red ones, the ratio would be 9:3 (since 9 checkered and 3 plain). But that would correspond to option C: 9,3,3,1, but excluding the brown and red parts. However, this interpretation might not align with the question's intent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presenting the options, or I'm misunderstanding the setup. Another thought: perhaps the question refers to the dihybrid cross as producing a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but when considering the actual number of each phenotype, it's represented differently. For example, in a sample of 16 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. But that still doesn't fit the options.\n\nAt this point, I realize that perhaps the problem is intended to recognize that the dihybrid cross results in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but the options provided don't reflect this. However, the closest option is option G: 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't make sense because it implies zero plain red. Option C: 9,3,3,1 adds up to 16, which might represent a smaller sample size. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each genotype in the F2 generation. If each parent produces 25% of each genotype, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these has a unique phenotype. Therefore, the number of each phenotype in the F2 would be equal if the population is large enough. However, the options provided don't include equal counts. Instead, they vary widely.\n\nPerhaps the question is mistakenly providing the options in a non-standard way, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Given that, I'll proceed to choose the option that best fits the expected phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross, even though it doesn't perfectly align with the given choices. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the understanding that each of the four possible genotypes results in one phenotype, thus giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect this.\n\nUpon reflection, the most accurate phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross is 1:1:1:1. However, since none of the options present this, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I understood it correctly.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, along with the expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc. Given that, the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is testing knowledge of dihybrid ratios, and the intended answer is option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype in a subset of the F2 generation, such as the 16 birds produced by a dihybrid cross, each having a unique phenotype, which would result in 4 of each phenotype. But this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy, where only certain alleles contribute to the phenotype. For example, if B is required for brown, and b is for plain, and similarly, C is required for red, while c is for checkered. But the problem states that B is dominant for brown and recessive for checkered, implying that B is needed to express brownness, and b expresses plain. Similarly, C is dominant for red and recessive for checkered. So, in this case, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the corresponding phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these has a unique phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 also sums to 16. Perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, grouping checkered and plain as one category and brown as another, but that changes the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype based on the actual number of each genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options fit.\n\nGiven this confusion, I might have to select the option that best represents the dihybrid cross ratio, even if it's not perfect, but considering that option G sums to 12+2+2+0=16, which is less than 100, and perhaps the question is considering a smaller sample or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the actual number of each genotype, which would be 25% for each genotype.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Let me use a Punnett square approach.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing. The F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in F2 genotypes. As each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nEach gene has two possible outcomes: dominant (present) or recessive (absent). For the pigment gene (C):\n- Presence (C) = 3/4 (since the bird can inherit C from either parent, given both parents are Cc)\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so each gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c. So for the pigment gene, the F2 will have a 3/4 chance of C (so red) and 1/4 chance of c (plain).\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (B):\n- Presence (B) = 3/4 (bird can inherit B from either parent, since both are Bb)\n- Absence (b) = 1/4\n\nNow, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are the product of their individual ratios.

Option A has different numbers, so probably not. But let me double-check the question to ensure I've interpreted the genes correctly.\n\nIn the question, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F2 generation's phenotypes are determined by these genes. The phenotypic ratio for F2 would indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since the bird could get either C or c from the parents, but since the parent is homozygous, each gamete contributes C)\nWait, no\u2014it's simpler: for a dihybrid cross, the probability of having a certain combination is based on the Punnett square. Let me use a Punnett square approach.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing. The F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in F2 genotypes. As each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nEach gene has two possible outcomes: dominant (present) or recessive (absent). For the pigment gene (C):\n- Presence (C) = 3/4 (since the bird can inherit C from either parent, given both parents are Cc)\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so each gamete has a 50% chance of being C or c. So for the pigment gene, the F2 will have a 3/4 chance of C (so red) and 1/4 chance of c (plain).\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (B):\n- Presence (B) = 3/4 (bird can inherit B from either parent, since both are Bb)\n- Absence (b) = 1/4\n\nNow, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are the product of their individual ratios. So:\n\nRed and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nRed and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPlain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which matches our calculation. Option A has different numbers, so probably not. But let me double-check the question to ensure I've interpreted the genes correctly.\n\nIn the question, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F2 generation's phenotypes are determined by these genes. The phenotypic ratio for F2 would indeed be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. So checking the options:\n\nOption D: 1 (checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 9 (plain red), 3 (plain brown). That fits our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

So, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c.\" So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is plain.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype differently than I thought.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by whether either gene is dominant. Let's consider each trait separately. For pigment color, the bird is red if it has at least one C allele (C or Cc), else plain (cc). For body color, the bird is brown if it has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), else checkered (bb). So the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are indeed as above, each occurring with 25% probability.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let's look at them:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 (Total 16)\nB. 8:4:0:4 (Total 16)\nC. 9:3:3:1 (Total 16)\nD. 1:3:9:3 (Total 16)\nE. 3:9:1:3 (Total 16)\nF. 4:4:4:4 (Total 16)\nG. 12:2:2:0 (Total 16)\nH. 5:3:2:6 (Total 16)\n\nSo none of these options have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that my initial understanding might be incorrect. Perhaps the problem considers the number of dominant and recessive alleles rather than the presence of the dominant trait. Wait, but the question specifies the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes. Let me try that approach. For each bird, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C_ (has C) \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 checkered\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would all be CcBb. Their gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% probability. Now, in F2, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (from C and c)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are Cc, Cb, cb, cc, each with certain probabilities. Now, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant), but what about the body color?\n  - If the bird is Cc (pigment red) and Cb (body color brown), then the phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n  - If Cc and cb (body color checkered), phenotype is Checkered Checkered.\n  - If Cc and cc (but wait, Cc cannot be cc; Cc is C and c, so for the body color, it would be Cb and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc, then for body color, it could be Cb or cb. Wait, no, Cc can only be Cb or cb, depending on which allele is passed. Wait, actually, the bird has Cc, so it can pass either C or c. If it passes C, then for the body color, it's Cb; if it passes c, then it's cb. So the possible phenotypes for Cc are:\n\n  - Cb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n  - cb: Pigment red (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, for Cb (pigment brown):\n\n- Can pass B or b. If B, then body is BB \u2192 Brown\n- If b, then body is Bb \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. For Cb, it's pigment brown (since C is dominant) and for body color, it can be B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype determined by the alleles from each parent. Since the parents are CcBb, the F1 is CcBb. In F2, each bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being any of these.\n\nNow, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach isn't accounting for all possible gametes correctly. Actually, the F2 population consists of all possible combinations of gametes from F1 parents. So, each F2 bird is a combination of two gametes from F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 genotypes are formed by the crossing of two CcBb individuals.\n\nLet me instead use a Punnett square approach for F2. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have the following possible genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the combination of alleles from F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (genotype)\n- 25% Ccbb (genotype)\n- 25% ccBB (genotype)\n- 25% ccBb (genotype)\n\nNow, determining the phenotype for each:\n\n1. CcBb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Ccbb: Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. ccBB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. ccBb: Plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for the pigment color, the presence of C determines red, and for body color, the presence of B determines brown. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. ccBb \u2192 Plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 2 occurrences\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply four phenotypes with two each, totaling eight, but the answer options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something in terms of dominance.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps each trait is considered separately, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait. So for pigment color, the bird is red if it has at least one C (C_), and for body color, it's brown if it has at least one B (B_). Thus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are as before.\n\nGiven that, the number of each phenotype would depend on how many F2 individuals have each genotype. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. However, some genotypes combine into the same phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, each of these four phenotypes occurs 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since the answer options don't include this, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, the question mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They mention creating a Punnett square for adihybridcrossing, but then specifically ask about the F2 generation. Wait, the adi hybrid cross refers to a cross between two birds, but the question is about the F2 from this cross. However, the initial explanation may have confused the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nWait, perhaps the adi hybrid cross is not relevant here, and the focus is on the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2, which would include the various genotypes and phenotypes as discussed earlier. However, according to the previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me confirm the parents again. The problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, checking each parent:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both alleles are C (dominant for pigment color) and B (dominant for body color). So, phenotype: Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_), which combines to Checkered Brown.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both alleles are c (recessive for pigment color) and b (recessive for body color). So, phenotype: Plain (c_) and plain (b_), which combines to Plain (both traits).\n\nNow, when these two parents are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. The F2 generation would consist of all possible combinations of gametes from F1. Each F1 bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% probability.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 All possible combinations, including:\n\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be based on the possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. So each F2 bird has a genotype determined by the sum of two gametes from F1. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete is CB, cb, cB, or cb, each with 25% probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are formed by the combination of two gametes from F1 parents. So, each F2 bird's genotype is the sum of two gametes from F1 parents. For example, if a bird receives a CB gamete from one parent and a cb gamete from the other, its genotype would be CcBb. Similarly, if it receives CB and CB, it's CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, each parent contributes one allele to the offspring. So, F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either C or c for pigment color, and B or b for body color. Therefore, the F2 genotype is formed by the combination of two gametes. For example, if a bird receives a CB gamete from one parent and a cb gamete from the other, its genotype would be CcBb (since C from CB and c from cb results in Cc for pigment, and B from CB and b from cb results in Bb for body color, making CcBb).\n\nWait, but that's getting too detailed. Instead, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, but some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. The four possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccBb. As previously established, each of these leads to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each phenotype category?\n\nSince each F2 bird is produced by two F1 parents, and each gamete is equally likely, the distribution of phenotypes in F2 would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nWait, that makes sense because the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, and half the birds will have Checkered Brown and the other half Plain Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, i.e., 50% Checkered Brown and 50% Plain Brown. Looking at the answer options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but our calculation suggests a 1:1 ratio. None of the options directly match this 1:1 ratio, but option E also sums to 16. However, since the options provided do not include a 1:1 ratio, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within a single trait, not across both traits. Let me reconsider. For pigment color alone, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_)\n- Pigment plain (cc)\n\nAnd for body color alone:\n\n- Body brown (B_)\n- Body plain (bb)\n\nHowever, the question is about the phenotype of both traits together. So, the combined phenotype is determined by both traits. Hence, the 1:1:1:1 ratio applies.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, plain red 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. But according to our analysis, it should be 8:8, which is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, not the phenotypic ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 1 bird checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown, then the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to squares where the coefficients follow a binomial expansion, such as (a + b)^2. This would happen if the parents were AaBb x AaBb, producing a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the parents are CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, which would produce a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. For the C locus: 25% C (red), 25% c (plain). For the B locus: 25% B (brown), 25% b (checkered). Since the genes are independent, each combination of C and B occurs at 25% probability. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- C_B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown (assuming brown is dominant over checkered, but wait, let's clarify: the problem states that red is C, plain is c, brown is B, and checkered is b. So, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c.\" So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is plain. Similarly, for body color: B is dominant (brown), b is checkered. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered Brown (since both C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain Brown\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered Brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nFor example:\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) = (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nSimilarly,\n- Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain (c) AND checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because 25% * 4 = 100%, which is correct. So all four phenotypes occur equally likely, each at 25% frequency. That would mean a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but looking at the options given, none seem to match that exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A through H, each giving different ratios. Maybe I misinterpreted how the phenotypes are categorized. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype differently than I thought.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by whether either gene is dominant. Let's consider each trait separately. For pigment color, the bird is red if it has at least one C allele (C or Cc), else plain (cc). For body color, the bird is brown if it has at least one B allele (BB or Bb), else checkered (bb). So the phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are indeed as above, each occurring with 25% probability.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let's look at them:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 (Total 16)\nB. 8:4:0:4 (Total 16)\nC. 9:3:3:1 (Total 16)\nD. 1:3:9:3 (Total 16)\nE. 3:9:1:3 (Total 16)\nF. 4:4:4:4 (Total 16)\nG. 12:2:2:0 (Total 16)\nH. 5:3:2:6 (Total 16)\n\nSo none of these options have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that my initial understanding might be incorrect. Perhaps the problem considers the number of dominant and recessive alleles rather than the presence of the dominant trait. Wait, but the question specifies the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes. Let me try that approach. For each bird, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C_ (has C) \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 checkered\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would all be CcBb. Their gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% probability. Now, in F2, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (from C and c)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are Cc, Cb, cb, cc, each with certain probabilities. Now, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant), but what about the body color?\n  - If the bird is Cc (pigment red) and Cb (body color brown), then the phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n  - If Cc and cb (body color checkered), phenotype is Checkered Checkered.\n  - If Cc and cc (but wait, Cc cannot be cc; Cc is C and c, so for the body color, it would be Cb and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc, then for body color, it could be Cb or cb. Wait, no, Cc can only be Cb or cb, depending on which allele is passed. Wait, actually, the bird has Cc, so it can pass either C or c. If it passes C, then for the body color, it's Cb; if it passes c, then it's cb. So the possible phenotypes for Cc are:\n\n  - Cb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n  - cb: Pigment red (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, for Cb (pigment brown):\n\n- Can pass B or b. If B, then body is BB \u2192 Brown\n- If b, then body is Bb \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. For Cb, it's pigment brown (since C is dominant) and for body color, it can be B (brown) or b (checkered).\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype determined by the alleles from each parent. Since the parents are CcBb, the F1 is CcBb. In F2, each bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being any of these.\n\nNow, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach isn't accounting for all possible gametes correctly. Actually, the F2 population consists of all possible combinations of gametes from F1 parents. So, each F2 bird is a combination of two gametes from F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 genotypes are formed by the crossing of two CcBb individuals.\n\nLet me instead use a Punnett square approach for F2. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have the following possible genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the combination of alleles from F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (genotype)\n- 25% Ccbb (genotype)\n- 25% ccBB (genotype)\n- 25% ccBb (genotype)\n\nNow, determining the phenotype for each:\n\n1. CcBb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Ccbb: Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. ccBB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. ccBb: Plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for the pigment color, the presence of C determines red, and for body color, the presence of B determines brown. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. ccBb \u2192 Plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 2 occurrences\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 2 occurrences\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply four phenotypes with two each, totaling eight, but the answer options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something in terms of dominance.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps each trait is considered separately, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait. So for pigment color, the bird is red if it has at least one C (C_), and for body color, it's brown if it has at least one B (B_). Thus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are as before.\n\nGiven that, the number of each phenotype would depend on how many F2 individuals have each genotype. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. However, some genotypes combine into the same phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, each of these four phenotypes occurs 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since the answer options don't include this, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, the question mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They mention creating a Punnett square for adihybridcrossing, but then specifically ask about the F2 generation. Wait, the adi hybrid cross refers to a cross between two birds, but the question is about the F2 from this cross. However, the initial explanation may have confused the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nWait, perhaps the adi hybrid cross is not relevant here, and the focus is on the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2, which would include the various genotypes and phenotypes as discussed earlier. However, according to the previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me confirm the parents again. The problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, checking each parent:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both alleles are C (dominant for pigment color) and B (dominant for body color). So, phenotype: Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_), which combines to Checkered Brown.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both alleles are c (recessive for pigment color) and b (recessive for body color). So, phenotype: Plain (c_) and plain (b_), which combines to Plain (both traits).\n\nNow, when these two parents are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. The F2 generation would consist of all possible combinations of gametes from F1. Each F1 bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% probability.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 All possible combinations, including:\n\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - CcBb (25%)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be based on the possible combinations of the F1 parents' gametes. So each F2 bird has a genotype determined by the sum of two gametes from F1. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete is CB, cb, cB, or cb, each with 25% probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are formed by the combination of two gametes from F1 parents. So, each F2 bird's genotype is the sum of two gametes from F1 parents. For example, if a bird receives a CB gamete from one parent and a cb gamete from the other, its genotype would be CcBb. Similarly, if it receives CB and CB, it's CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, each parent contributes one allele to the offspring. So, F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either C or c for pigment color, and B or b for body color. Therefore, the F2 genotype is formed by the combination of two gametes. For example, if a bird receives a CB gamete from one parent and a cb gamete from the other, its genotype would be CcBb (since C from CB and c from cb results in Cc for pigment, and B from CB and b from cb results in Bb for body color, making CcBb).\n\nWait, but that's getting too detailed. Instead, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, but some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. The four possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccBb. As previously established, each of these leads to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each phenotype category?\n\nSince each F2 bird is produced by two F1 parents, and each gamete is equally likely, the distribution of phenotypes in F2 would be as follows:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Phenotype 1 and 3 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 2 and 4 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nWait, that makes sense because the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, and half the birds will have Checkered Brown and the other half Plain Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, i.e., 50% Checkered Brown and 50% Plain Brown. Looking at the answer options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but our calculation suggests a 1:1 ratio. None of the options directly match this 1:1 ratio, but option E also sums to 16. However, since the options provided do not include a 1:1 ratio, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within a single trait, not across both traits. Let me reconsider. For pigment color alone, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_)\n- Pigment plain (cc)\n\nAnd for body color alone:\n\n- Body brown (B_)\n- Body plain (bb)\n\nHowever, the question is about the phenotype of both traits together. So, the combined phenotype is determined by both traits. Hence, the 1:1:1:1 ratio applies.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, plain red 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. But according to our analysis, it should be 8:8, which is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, not the phenotypic ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nIf the F2 generation has 1 bird checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown, then the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to squares where the coefficients follow a binomial expansion, such as (a + b)^2. This would happen if the parents were AaBb x AaBb, producing a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the parents are CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, which would produce a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's consider the F2 generation: the possible phenotypes are:",
    "rollout": " Let's consider the F2 generation: the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B are recessive (so c and b alleles)\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive (cB)\n- Plain red: c and B recessive (cc)\n- Plain brown: c and B dominant (cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will express the pigment color. Similarly, B being dominant will express brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene. Each gene has a 50% chance of being present in the F2 generation. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C present = 25% (since F2 has 25% CC and 50% Cc and 25% cc)\n- Probability of c present = 75%\n\nSimilarly, for the body color (B):\n- Probability of B present = 25% (BB and Bb)\n- Probability of b present = 75%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): (75%) * (25%) = 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into ratios:\n\n1. 6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n1 : 3 : 3 : 9\n\nBut wait, 6.25 / 6.25 = 1, 18.75 /6.25=3, same for the others. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nOptions J through H are various ratios. Let me see what the user provided as the answer options:\n\nLooking at the user's provided options:\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, but our simplified ratio is 1:3:3:9, which sums to 16 parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the actual counts might be better represented as numbers instead of percentages. Since the F2 generation has 9 possible phenotypes, but some combine.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes along with their frequencies.\n\nThe F2 population consists of 9 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Plain Red)\n8. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n9. cc bb (Plain Red)\n\nEach of these has a frequency based on the Punnett square. From the previous calculation, each has the following frequency:\n\n1. CC BB: 25%\n2. CC Bb: 25%\n3. CC bb: 25%\n4. Cc BB: 25%\n5. Cc Bb: 25%\n6. Cc bb: 25%\n7. cc BB: 25%\n8. cc Bb: 25%\n9. cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, F2 from two heterozygotes (Cc and Bb) will have the following genotypic distribution: 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% CC bb, 25% Cc BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb. So each has a 25% frequency.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 4, 7, 8 \u2192 4 cases \u2192 Frequency 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,9 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 Frequency 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3,6,10? Wait, no\u2014cases 3,6, and 10? Wait, the third phenotype is Plain Brown, which includes CC bb (case 3), Cc bb (case 6), and cc BB (case7?), no\u2014wait, case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red. Case3 is CC bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Case6 is Cc bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red. Case8 is cc Bb\u2192 Plain Brown. So Plain Brown has cases 3,6,8 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 25%.\n- Plain Red: Cases 7 and 8? No, case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red, case8 is cc Bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list them clearly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n---|---|---\nCheckered Red | CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, cc Bb | Cases 1,4,7,8 \u2192 4 cases\nCheckered Brown | CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb | Cases 2,5,9 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Brown | CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb | Cases 3,6,10? Wait, no\u2014cases 3,6, and 10? Wait, there are only nine cases. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Cases\n---|---\nCheckered Red | 1,4,7,8 \u2192 4\nCheckered Brown | 2,5,9 \u2192 3\nPlain Brown | 3,6 \u2192 2\nPlain Red | 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype had a different frequency: Checkered Red was 25%, Checkered Brown 25%, Plain Brown 25%, Plain Red 25%.\n\nBut according to the count above, Checkered Red is 4 cases (25%), Checkered Brown 3 cases (25%), Plain Brown 2 cases (25%), and Plain Red 2 cases (25%). That adds up to 9 cases, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:3:2:2. But that's not matching any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nK. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 parts\n\nN. 4,4,0,4 \u2192 12 parts\n\nO. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 parts\n\nP. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nQ. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 parts\n\nR. 3,3,9,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nS. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nT. 2,6,2,6 \u2192 16 parts\n\nU. 1,2,6,2 \u2192 11 parts\n\nV. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nW. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nX. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nY. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 parts\n\nZ. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nHmm, option U is 3,9,3,1 \u2192 which adds up to 16 parts. Option V is 3,9,3,1, which also adds up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio is 4:3:2:2, which isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the phenotypic breakdown. Perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb), 5 (Cc Bb), 9 (cc Bb) \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb), 10? Wait, no\u2014only 9 cases. Cases 3,6, and 10 don't exist. So Plain Brown: 3 cases\n- Plain Red: 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but according to this, it's 4:3:2:2, which is 12 parts. Hmm, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of each phenotype.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of counting cases, use the probabilities. For example:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n\nBut adding these together would imply a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which doesn't match the options. This suggests that perhaps the user provided the wrong answer options, or I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypic codes. According to the user, the dominant alleles are:\n\n- pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- body color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain Red\n\nBut in reality, if C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will exhibit the pigment color, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will exhibit brown color, regardless of C. Thus, the phenotypes are indeed:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B dominant\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain Brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain Red: c and B recessive\n\nWhich aligns with my previous analysis. So the frequencies are 25% for each, leading to a ratio of 4:3:2:2 across 9 cases.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption X: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nOption V: 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nOption U: 3,9,3,1 \u2192 same as V.\n\nOption Y: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 same as V.\n\nOption Z: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 same as V.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio as 3:9:3:1, which would mean the ratio is 3:9:3:1, summing to 16. In that case, option V (3,9,3,1) would correspond to 3:9:3:1, which seems plausible because it's a common Mendelian ratio for two traits. However, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 4:3:2:2. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the presence of the recessive alleles rather than dominance. If the dominant allele is recessive, then the ratios change. But in standard genetics, dominant alleles are expressed unless they're homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is dominant and recessive is c, then any bird with at least one C will have the pigment color. Similarly, any bird with at least one B will have brown. So the phenotypes are determined solely by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Red, totaling 100%. So the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but considering the 9 cases, it's 4:3:2:2. But this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered the presence of dominant alleles, which could lead to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in how the phenotypes are counted.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's consider the F2 generation: the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B are recessive (so c and b alleles)\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b recessive (cB)\n- Plain red: c and B recessive (cc)\n- Plain brown: c and B dominant (cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will express the pigment color. Similarly, B being dominant will express brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene. Each gene has a 50% chance of being present in the F2 generation. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C present = 25% (since F2 has 25% CC and 50% Cc and 25% cc)\n- Probability of c present = 75%\n\nSimilarly, for the body color (B):\n- Probability of B present = 25% (BB and Bb)\n- Probability of b present = 75%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): (75%) * (25%) = 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into ratios:\n\n1. 6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n1 : 3 : 3 : 9\n\nBut wait, 6.25 / 6.25 = 1, 18.75 /6.25=3, same for the others. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nOptions J through H are various ratios. Let me see what the user provided as the answer options:\n\nLooking at the user's provided options:\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, but our simplified ratio is 1:3:3:9, which sums to 16 parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the actual counts might be better represented as numbers instead of percentages. Since the F2 generation has 9 possible phenotypes, but some combine.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes along with their frequencies.\n\nThe F2 population consists of 9 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC bb (Plain Brown)\n4. Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n6. Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n7. cc BB (Plain Red)\n8. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n9. cc bb (Plain Red)\n\nEach of these has a frequency based on the Punnett square. From the previous calculation, each has the following frequency:\n\n1. CC BB: 25%\n2. CC Bb: 25%\n3. CC bb: 25%\n4. Cc BB: 25%\n5. Cc Bb: 25%\n6. Cc bb: 25%\n7. cc BB: 25%\n8. cc Bb: 25%\n9. cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, F2 from two heterozygotes (Cc and Bb) will have the following genotypic distribution: 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% CC bb, 25% Cc BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% Cc bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb, 25% cc bb. So each has a 25% frequency.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 4, 7, 8 \u2192 4 cases \u2192 Frequency 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,9 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 Frequency 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3,6,10? Wait, no\u2014cases 3,6, and 10? Wait, the third phenotype is Plain Brown, which includes CC bb (case 3), Cc bb (case 6), and cc BB (case7?), no\u2014wait, case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red. Case3 is CC bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Case6 is Cc bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red. Case8 is cc Bb\u2192 Plain Brown. So Plain Brown has cases 3,6,8 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 25%.\n- Plain Red: Cases 7 and 8? No, case7 is cc BB\u2192 Plain Red, case8 is cc Bb\u2192 Plain Brown. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list them clearly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n---|---|---\nCheckered Red | CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, cc Bb | Cases 1,4,7,8 \u2192 4 cases\nCheckered Brown | CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb | Cases 2,5,9 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Brown | CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb | Cases 3,6,10? Wait, no\u2014cases 3,6, and 10? Wait, there are only nine cases. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Cases\n---|---\nCheckered Red | 1,4,7,8 \u2192 4\nCheckered Brown | 2,5,9 \u2192 3\nPlain Brown | 3,6 \u2192 2\nPlain Red | 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype had a different frequency: Checkered Red was 25%, Checkered Brown 25%, Plain Brown 25%, Plain Red 25%.\n\nBut according to the count above, Checkered Red is 4 cases (25%), Checkered Brown 3 cases (25%), Plain Brown 2 cases (25%), and Plain Red 2 cases (25%). That adds up to 9 cases, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:3:2:2. But that's not matching any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nK. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 parts\n\nN. 4,4,0,4 \u2192 12 parts\n\nO. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 parts\n\nP. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nQ. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 parts\n\nR. 3,3,9,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nS. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nT. 2,6,2,6 \u2192 16 parts\n\nU. 1,2,6,2 \u2192 11 parts\n\nV. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nW. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts\n\nX. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nY. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 parts\n\nZ. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nHmm, option U is 3,9,3,1 \u2192 which adds up to 16 parts. Option V is 3,9,3,1, which also adds up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio is 4:3:2:2, which isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the phenotypic breakdown. Perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb), 5 (Cc Bb), 9 (cc Bb) \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb), 10? Wait, no\u2014only 9 cases. Cases 3,6, and 10 don't exist. So Plain Brown: 3 cases\n- Plain Red: 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but according to this, it's 4:3:2:2, which is 12 parts. Hmm, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of each phenotype.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of counting cases, use the probabilities. For example:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n\nBut adding these together would imply a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which doesn't match the options. This suggests that perhaps the user provided the wrong answer options, or I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypic codes. According to the user, the dominant alleles are:\n\n- pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- body color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain Red\n\nBut in reality, if C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will exhibit the pigment color, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will exhibit brown color, regardless of C. Thus, the phenotypes are indeed:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B dominant\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain Brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain Red: c and B recessive\n\nWhich aligns with my previous analysis. So the frequencies are 25% for each, leading to a ratio of 4:3:2:2 across 9 cases.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption X: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12 parts\n\nOption V: 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16 parts\n\nOption U: 3,9,3,1 \u2192 same as V.\n\nOption Y: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 same as V.\n\nOption Z: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 same as V.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio as 3:9:3:1, which would mean the ratio is 3:9:3:1, summing to 16. In that case, option V (3,9,3,1) would correspond to 3:9:3:1, which seems plausible because it's a common Mendelian ratio for two traits. However, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 4:3:2:2. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the presence of the recessive alleles rather than dominance. If the dominant allele is recessive, then the ratios change. But in standard genetics, dominant alleles are expressed unless they're homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is dominant and recessive is c, then any bird with at least one C will have the pigment color. Similarly, any bird with at least one B will have brown. So the phenotypes are determined solely by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Brown, 25% Plain Red, totaling 100%. So the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but considering the 9 cases, it's 4:3:2:2. But this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered the presence of dominant alleles, which could lead to different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in how the phenotypes are counted. Let me try another approach: counting the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4 cases (as before)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: 2 cases\n- Plain Red: 2 cases\n\nSo the ratio is 4:3:2:2, which simplifies to 2:1.5:1:1, but this isn't helpful. Alternatively, in terms of whole numbers, it's 4:3:2:2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the user-provided options:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nE. 3,3,9,1 \u2192 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 18\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\n\nK. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nN. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nO. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nP. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nQ. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nR. 3,3,9,1 \u2192 16\n\nS. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nT. 2,6,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nU. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nV. 3,9,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nWait, option V is 3,9,3,1, which sums to 16.

Maybe it's expecting the ratio of the number of each phenotype without necessarily reducing it to the simplest form. Looking back at the options, option U is 3,9,3,1, which sums to 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the probability of each allele is known: Parent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes, so in F1 (CcBb), the gametes are half CB and half cb.",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, the probability of each allele is known: Parent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes, so in F1 (CcBb), the gametes are half CB and half cb. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (genotype)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (same as above, different order doesn't matter)\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s better to consider the F2 as all possible combinations of the gametes. So each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBb\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: ccbb\n\nSo all four combinations, each occurring with equal frequency (25%). Therefore, the F2 population consists of 25% CcBb, 25% Ccbb, 25% ccBb, and 25% ccbb.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each bird has a phenotype determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb:\n   - C is present \u2192 red\n   - B is present \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n2. CcBb:\n   Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n3. ccBb:\n   - c is present \u2192 plain\n   - B is present \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. ccbb:\n   - c is present \u2192 plain\n   - b is present \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain checkered\n\nSo among the four F2 genotypes, two are CcBb (Checkered brown), and two are ccBb (Plain brown) and ccbb (Plain checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n- Plain checkered: 1/4\n\nBut looking back, the options given don't match exactly. Wait, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 (but that's 6 red, 2 brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown)\n\nWait, I might have misinterpreted something. Let me double-check. Perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype, regardless of the bird type. Alternatively, maybe the question counts the number of each bird type rather than the phenotype distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the count of each phenotype in the entire F2 population, considering all bird types.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of focusing on the phenotypic ratios directly, calculate how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nEach bird has four possible genotypes, each equally likely. So in the F2 generation, there are 16 birds (since each parent produces four gametes, leading to 4x4=16 possible combinations). Wait, no\u2014each F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes, so F2 would be 16 birds. But earlier analysis said each F2 bird is either CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, or ccbb, each 25% chance. So 16 birds total.\n\nNow, determining how many have each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered brown (CcBb): How many? Half of the 16 birds would be CcBb, but wait, each bird's genotype affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If they have at least one C and one B, they're Checkered brown.\n- If they have at least one C and one b, they're Plain brown.\n- If they have at least one c and one B, they're Checkered plain.\n- If they have at least one c and one b, they're Plain checkered.\n\nSo now, counting how many of the 16 birds fall into each category.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBb: Checkered brown\n2. CcBb: Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: Plain brown\n4. ccbb: Plain checkered\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory because each bird's genotype is either CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, or ccbb, each appearing twice in the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014the F2 is made by the F1 (CcBb) selfing, which results in four types of genotypes, each with equal frequency. So in reality, there are eight birds with each genotype (since each parent produces four gametes, making 16 birds total, but the phenotypic ratios split them into groups). Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype, which translates to a specific phenotype. Let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered brown (CcBb):\n\nNumber of such birds = 25% of 16 = 4 birds.\n\nEach bird is CcBb, so they are Checkered brown.\n\n2. Plain brown (Ccbb):\n\nThese are birds where they have at least one C (so at least one C) and at least one b (so at least one recessive b for the B gene). The possible genotypes for these birds are:\n\n- Ccbb: At least C (C) and at least b (b)\n- CcBb: At least C and at least B \u2192 already counted in Checkered brown\n- ccbb: Only b \u2192 doesn't meet the criteria\n- Ccbb: At least C and at least b\n\nWait, but in F2, the genotype Ccbb corresponds to Ccbb, which includes the possibility of having at least one C and at least one b. So in terms of phenotype, Ccbb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, ccbb \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nAnd cC? Hmm, perhaps another approach: For the B gene, if the bird is at least B (i.e., has at least one dominant B allele), then it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for the C gene: if at least one C, then red; otherwise, plain.\n\nThus, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo let's categorize each F2 bird:\n\n1. CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: Does not have C (c) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. ccbb: Does not have C (c) and does not have B (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, but this is only accounting for four birds. That can\u2019t be right because we have 16 birds in total. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another method.\n\nThe possible genotypes in F2 are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\n- CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Has C and b \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccBb: Does not have C \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccbb: Does not have C and does not have B \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, among the 16 birds, each of the four genotypes appears twice (since each F1 produces four gametes, leading to 16 birds). Wait, no\u2014each F1 produces four gametes, so F2 would have 16 birds, with each of the four genotypes appearing four times. Wait, no\u2014each F1 produces four gametes, so F2 would have 16 birds, but each F2 bird has a unique combination of two alleles. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each in a 50% ratio. So when F1 selfs, each gamete combines with another, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the four F2 genotypes occur in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, each 25%.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. ccBb: Plain brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. ccbb: Plain checkered \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSince each genotype occurs once in the 16 birds, there are 4 birds of Phenotype A, 4 of Phenotype B, and 4 of Phenotype C. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's genotype is represented by their own phenotype. Let me recount:\n\nIn the 16 birds:\n\n- CcBb: 4 birds (since each F2 bird is formed by two gametes, each contributing one allele, so 4 instances)\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 4\n- ccBb: 4\n- ccbb: 4\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBb: Plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n- ccbb: Plain checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 birds. So each phenotype occurs 4 times. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 2:6:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nSo option F says 4:4:4:4, which matches our calculation. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let's compute for each bird:\n\n1. CcBb: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n2. CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n3. ccBb: B is dominant \u2192 Brown (phenotype B)\n4. ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Checkered (phenotype C)\n\nEach of these four cases repeats four times in the F2 population. So in total:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4 birds\n- Phenotype B: 4 birds\n- Phenotype C: 4 birds\n\nWhich indeed sums to 16 birds. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. But this isn't matching any of the provided options except option J (2:6:3:1), which doesn't align. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Because if it's F1, which is CcBb, then the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n- ccBb: Plain brown (phenotype B)\n- ccbb: Plain checkered (phenotype C)\n\nBut F1 is a single generation, so maybe the question is about F1. However, the user wrote \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" implying F1. But the problem says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, maybe I misread. Adihybridcross usually involves two different traits being crossed, like two genes. So perhaps the question is about crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (which is CcBB?) Wait, no\u2014the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb. So the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, but in the user's description, the cross is stated as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which suggests F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the next generation. So perhaps the question is about F2. But according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about F1, but the phrasing was unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should reconsider. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 This could correspond to the number of each phenotype in a different context, perhaps considering the presence of certain alleles without considering dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation. Wait, the user's question says \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird\" as the parents for the adihybridcross. So the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, producing F1 (CcBb), then F2 is considered. But in the question prompt, the user writes:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"adihybridcross\" refers to a cross involving two different traits, i.e., two genes, which would involve a dihybrid cross. But in this case, the parents are both homozygous for each gene. For example, CC BB is homozygous for pigment (C) and color (B). Similarly, cc bb is homozygous for pigment (c) and color (b). So the cross is between two individuals who are homozygous for each gene, which would lead to all F1 being heterozygous (CcBb) and the F2 being all combinations. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered blue (wait, no\u2014the B locus determines color: brown (dominant) vs. checkered (recessive)), and similarly for C. So the F2 would have 25% CcBb (Checkered brown), 25% Ccbb (Checkered blue?), 25% ccBb (Plain brown), 25% ccbb (Plain blue). Wait, but this contradicts my earlier analysis. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, in the F2, each gene would segregate into Cc and Bb, leading to four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance. Translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain blue\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"a plain brown bird\" and \"a plain brown\", so perhaps the color locus is being treated separately. Alternatively, perhaps the color is determined by another gene, say 'b', but that's not specified. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, and F2 with four genotypes, each 25% chance, leading to 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered blue, 25% Plain brown, 25% Plain blue. But this doesn't match the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of dominant alleles for both genes, ignoring recessiveness beyond dominance. Let me recast the problem:\n\nAssuming that for the B locus, brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown. Similarly, for the C locus, any bird with at least one C allele is red. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB (homozygous for both) and cc bb (homozygous for both), then the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. In F2, the possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb, each with equal frequency (25%).\n\nTranslating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: C dominant and b \u2192 brown\n- ccBb: c \u2192 plain brown\n- ccbb: neither \u2192 plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered brown (wait, no\u2014each bird is CcBb, CcBb, ccBb, ccbb), so 25% for each. Wait, no\u2014each bird's genotype is one of four, so 25% for each. But considering the phenotype:\n\n- 25% Checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% Checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% Plain brown (ccBb)\n- 25% Plain brown (ccbb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype. So:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's genotype is:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: same \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nWait, that would imply 50% Checkered brown and 50% Plain brown, but that doesn't fit the options.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So for each gene, the probability of each allele is known: Parent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes, so in F1 (CcBb), the gametes are half CB and half cb. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (genotype)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (same as above, different order doesn't matter)\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s better to consider the F2 as all possible combinations of the gametes. So each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBb\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: ccbb\n\nSo all four combinations, each occurring with equal frequency (25%). Therefore, the F2 population consists of 25% CcBb, 25% Ccbb, 25% ccBb, and 25% ccbb.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each bird has a phenotype determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb:\n   - C is present \u2192 red\n   - B is present \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n2. CcBb:\n   Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n3. ccBb:\n   - c is present \u2192 plain\n   - B is present \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. ccbb:\n   - c is present \u2192 plain\n   - b is present \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain checkered\n\nSo among the four F2 genotypes, two are CcBb (Checkered brown), and two are ccBb (Plain brown) and ccbb (Plain checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n- Plain checkered: 1/4\n\nBut looking back, the options given don't match exactly. Wait, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 (but that's 6 red, 2 brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown)\n\nWait, I might have misinterpreted something. Let me double-check. Perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype, regardless of the bird type. Alternatively, maybe the question counts the number of each bird type rather than the phenotype distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the count of each phenotype in the entire F2 population, considering all bird types.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of focusing on the phenotypic ratios directly, calculate how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nEach bird has four possible genotypes, each equally likely. So in the F2 generation, there are 16 birds (since each parent produces four gametes, leading to 4x4=16 possible combinations). Wait, no\u2014each F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes, so F2 would be 16 birds. But earlier analysis said each F2 bird is either CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, or ccbb, each 25% chance. So 16 birds total.\n\nNow, determining how many have each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered brown (CcBb): How many? Half of the 16 birds would be CcBb, but wait, each bird's genotype affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If they have at least one C and one B, they're Checkered brown.\n- If they have at least one C and one b, they're Plain brown.\n- If they have at least one c and one B, they're Checkered plain.\n- If they have at least one c and one b, they're Plain checkered.\n\nSo now, counting how many of the 16 birds fall into each category.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBb: Checkered brown\n2. CcBb: Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: Plain brown\n4. ccbb: Plain checkered\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory because each bird's genotype is either CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, or ccbb, each appearing twice in the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014the F2 is made by the F1 (CcBb) selfing, which results in four types of genotypes, each with equal frequency. So in reality, there are eight birds with each genotype (since each parent produces four gametes, making 16 birds total, but the phenotypic ratios split them into groups). Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype, which translates to a specific phenotype. Let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered brown (CcBb):\n\nNumber of such birds = 25% of 16 = 4 birds.\n\nEach bird is CcBb, so they are Checkered brown.\n\n2. Plain brown (Ccbb):\n\nThese are birds where they have at least one C (so at least one C) and at least one b (so at least one recessive b for the B gene). The possible genotypes for these birds are:\n\n- Ccbb: At least C (C) and at least b (b)\n- CcBb: At least C and at least B \u2192 already counted in Checkered brown\n- ccbb: Only b \u2192 doesn't meet the criteria\n- Ccbb: At least C and at least b\n\nWait, but in F2, the genotype Ccbb corresponds to Ccbb, which includes the possibility of having at least one C and at least one b. So in terms of phenotype, Ccbb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, ccbb \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nAnd cC? Hmm, perhaps another approach: For the B gene, if the bird is at least B (i.e., has at least one dominant B allele), then it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for the C gene: if at least one C, then red; otherwise, plain.\n\nThus, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo let's categorize each F2 bird:\n\n1. CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n2. CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: Does not have C (c) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. ccbb: Does not have C (c) and does not have B (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, but this is only accounting for four birds. That can\u2019t be right because we have 16 birds in total. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another method.\n\nThe possible genotypes in F2 are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\n- CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: Has C and b \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccBb: Does not have C \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccbb: Does not have C and does not have B \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, among the 16 birds, each of the four genotypes appears twice (since each F1 produces four gametes, leading to 16 birds). Wait, no\u2014each F1 produces four gametes, so F2 would have 16 birds, with each of the four genotypes appearing four times. Wait, no\u2014each F1 produces four gametes, so F2 would have 16 birds, but each F2 bird has a unique combination of two alleles. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each in a 50% ratio. So when F1 selfs, each gamete combines with another, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the four F2 genotypes occur in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, each 25%.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. ccBb: Plain brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. ccbb: Plain checkered \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSince each genotype occurs once in the 16 birds, there are 4 birds of Phenotype A, 4 of Phenotype B, and 4 of Phenotype C. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's genotype is represented by their own phenotype. Let me recount:\n\nIn the 16 birds:\n\n- CcBb: 4 birds (since each F2 bird is formed by two gametes, each contributing one allele, so 4 instances)\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 4\n- ccBb: 4\n- ccbb: 4\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- CcBb: Checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBb: Plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n- ccbb: Plain checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 birds. So each phenotype occurs 4 times. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 2:6:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nSo option F says 4:4:4:4, which matches our calculation. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Let's compute for each bird:\n\n1. CcBb: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n2. CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n3. ccBb: B is dominant \u2192 Brown (phenotype B)\n4. ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Checkered (phenotype C)\n\nEach of these four cases repeats four times in the F2 population. So in total:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4 birds\n- Phenotype B: 4 birds\n- Phenotype C: 4 birds\n\nWhich indeed sums to 16 birds. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. But this isn't matching any of the provided options except option J (2:6:3:1), which doesn't align. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Because if it's F1, which is CcBb, then the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown (phenotype A)\n- ccBb: Plain brown (phenotype B)\n- ccbb: Plain checkered (phenotype C)\n\nBut F1 is a single generation, so maybe the question is about F1. However, the user wrote \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" implying F1. But the problem says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, maybe I misread. Adihybridcross usually involves two different traits being crossed, like two genes. So perhaps the question is about crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (which is CcBB?) Wait, no\u2014the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb. So the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, but in the user's description, the cross is stated as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which suggests F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the next generation. So perhaps the question is about F2. But according to my previous analysis, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about F1, but the phrasing was unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should reconsider. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 This could correspond to the number of each phenotype in a different context, perhaps considering the presence of certain alleles without considering dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation. Wait, the user's question says \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird\" as the parents for the adihybridcross. So the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, producing F1 (CcBb), then F2 is considered. But in the question prompt, the user writes:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"adihybridcross\" refers to a cross involving two different traits, i.e., two genes, which would involve a dihybrid cross. But in this case, the parents are both homozygous for each gene. For example, CC BB is homozygous for pigment (C) and color (B). Similarly, cc bb is homozygous for pigment (c) and color (b). So the cross is between two individuals who are homozygous for each gene, which would lead to all F1 being heterozygous (CcBb) and the F2 being all combinations. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered blue (wait, no\u2014the B locus determines color: brown (dominant) vs. checkered (recessive)), and similarly for C. So the F2 would have 25% CcBb (Checkered brown), 25% Ccbb (Checkered blue?), 25% ccBb (Plain brown), 25% ccbb (Plain blue). Wait, but this contradicts my earlier analysis. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, in the F2, each gene would segregate into Cc and Bb, leading to four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance. Translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain blue\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"a plain brown bird\" and \"a plain brown\", so perhaps the color locus is being treated separately. Alternatively, perhaps the color is determined by another gene, say 'b', but that's not specified. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, and F2 with four genotypes, each 25% chance, leading to 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered blue, 25% Plain brown, 25% Plain blue. But this doesn't match the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of dominant alleles for both genes, ignoring recessiveness beyond dominance. Let me recast the problem:\n\nAssuming that for the B locus, brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown. Similarly, for the C locus, any bird with at least one C allele is red. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB (homozygous for both) and cc bb (homozygous for both), then the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. In F2, the possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb, each with equal frequency (25%).\n\nTranslating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Ccbb: C dominant and b \u2192 brown\n- ccBb: c \u2192 plain brown\n- ccbb: neither \u2192 plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered brown, 25% Checkered brown (wait, no\u2014each bird is CcBb, CcBb, ccBb, ccbb), so 25% for each. Wait, no\u2014each bird's genotype is one of four, so 25% for each. But considering the phenotype:\n\n- 25% Checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% Checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 25% Plain brown (ccBb)\n- 25% Plain brown (ccbb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype. So:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird's genotype is:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- CcBb: same \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Plain brown\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nWait, that would imply 50% Checkered brown and 50% Plain brown, but that doesn't fit the options.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me calculate the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Presence (C): 75%\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor the body (B):\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (Red Brown)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (Red Checkered)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (Plain Brown)\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (Plain Checkered)\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into ratios:\n\n- Red Brown : 56.25%\n- Red Checkered : 18.75%\n- Plain Brown : 18.75%\n- Plain Checkered : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, multiply all by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n- Red Brown : 9\n- Red Checkered : 3\n- Plain Brown : 3\n- Plain Checkered : 1\n\nWait, but the options given don't exactly match this. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions G to H are:\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nBut according to my calculation, the ratio is checkered red (Plain) 1, checkered brown (Plain) 3, plain red (Red) 9, plain brown (Checkered) 3. Wait, that doesn't align with any option except D. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the letters. Maybe the letters correspond differently. Let me re-express the options in terms of their ratios.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's compute the probability of each phenotype:",
    "rollout": " Let's compute the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (red): 75% (since CC and Cc are dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain): 25%\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n- Probability of B (brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some people might consider whether 'plain' includes both colors being plain, but in this case, since both genes determine separate traits, the phenotypes are combinations where either one or both genes are dominant.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the phenotypic ratio is based on the product of the probabilities of each trait occurring.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 56.25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain and Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain and Checkered: 6.25%\n\nIf we convert these percentages to counts, assuming a large population, say 100 birds, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 56\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 19\n- Plain and Brown: 19\n- Plain and Checkered: 6\n\nAdding these up gives 56+19+19+6=100, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 total, matches our calculation of 56,19,19,6? Wait, no, my earlier count was 56,19,19,6. None of the options match exactly except option D, which sums to 16, but according to our calculation, the actual numbers are 56,19,19,6, none of which match any option given. Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nLet me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G says 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, no.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, no.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, no.\nOption I: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation shows 56,19,19,6, which isn't listed. Hmm.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in calculating the probabilities?\n\nWait, another approach: For each gene, the probability of the resulting trait is additive. For example, for pigment color, the probability of having red is 75%, and for body color, brown is 75%.\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive because some phenotypes may combine. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the answer expects us to look at the number of phenotypic classes rather than exact counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Looking back, the user provided several options, including A through E, each giving specific counts like 6,2, etc. Perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, going back: My earlier breakdown showed that Pigment red and Brown occur at 56.25%, Pigment red and Checkered at 18.75%, Plain and Brown at 18.75%, and Plain and Checkered at 6.25%. If we take 100 birds, that translates to approximately 56, 19, 19, and 6 respectively. But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, which is too low.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation suggests 56,19,19,6, which isn't matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Instead of relying on percentages, perhaps I should list all possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body color. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (RR BB)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (RR bb)\n3. Plain (rr) and Brown (BB)\n4. Plain (rr) and Checkered (bb)\n\nThe chance of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red (probability 75%) AND Brown (75%) \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (0.75) AND Checkered (0.25) \u2192 0.75*0.25=0.1875\u219218.75%\n3. Plain (0.25) AND Brown (0.75) \u21920.25*0.75=0.1875\u219218.75%\n4. Plain (0.25) AND Checkered (0.25) \u21920.25*0.25=0.0625\u21926.25%\n\nAgain, same as before. So the expected phenotypic distribution is 56.25% Pigment red and Brown, 18.75% Pigment red and Checkered, 18.75% Plain and Brown, 6.25% Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, looking at the options, perhaps the correct one is Option D: 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. But our calculations don't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the options expect different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the options are counting the number of birds instead of the percentage. Let me assume that the options are showing the counts of each phenotype among 16 birds, which doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, rounding to whole numbers.\n\nIn that case, 56.25% rounds to 56, 18.75% rounds to 19, and so on. However, none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, no.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation is 56,19,19,6. So that's way off.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, no.\n\nOption I: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16, but counts are much lower.\n\nHmm. Maybe I messed up the initial assumption. Let me double-check the parent genotypes and their gametes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 would be all the possible combinations of their alleles. Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, the F1 is CB and cb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that's assuming independent assortment, which is usually the case unless stated otherwise. However, in reality, F1 is heterozygous for both genes, so the segregation would be 25% for each type. But regardless, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- C is dominant, so CC and Cc are red\n- B is dominant, so BB and Bb are brown\n- c is recessive, so cc is plain\n- b is recessive, so bb is checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of the above:\n\n1. CC and BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. CC and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc and BB \u2192 brown and brown \u2192 brown-brown\n6. Cc and Bb \u2192 brown and brown \u2192 brown-brown\n7. Cc and bb \u2192 brown and checkered \u2192 brown-checkered\n8. Cc and bb \u2192 brown and checkered \u2192 brown-checkered\n9. cc and BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n10. cc and Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n11. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n12. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red-checkered: 4 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Brown-brown: 4 (from Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Brown-checkered: 4 (from Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain-brown: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 (from cc bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+4+4+4+2+2=20, which is impossible because there are only 16 F2 individuals. Wait, I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount, ensuring that each combination is counted once:\n\nPhenotype | Number of F2 Birds\n--- | ---\nRed-Brown | From CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\nRed-Checkered | From CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\nBrown-Brown | From Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nBrown-Checkered | From Cc bb \u2192 1 bird\nPlain-Brown | From cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPlain-Checkered | From cc bb, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1+2+2=13, still missing one. Where's the fifth?\n\nAh, I see. The remaining two F2 birds are from cc bb and cc bb, making 2, totaling 13. But that's inconsistent with 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I missed some. Let me list them clearly:\n\nFrom CC BB: 1\nCC Bb: 2\nCc BB: 3\nCc Bb: 4\nCC bb: 5\nCc bb: 6\nCc bb: 7\ncc BB: 8\ncc Bb: 9\ncc bb: 10\ncc bb: 11\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me use a table.\n\nF2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n10. cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1,2 \u2192 2 birds\n- Red-Checkered: 3 \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown-Brown: 4,5 \u2192 2 birds\n- Brown-Checkered: 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain-Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: 9,10 \u2192 2 birds\n\nTotal: 2+1+2+1+2+2=10. Still under 16. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, I think I missed the fact that some of the F2 genotypes could be homozygous for one gene or another. Wait, let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 6\n7. cc BB \u2192 7\n8. cc Bb \u2192 8\n9. cc bb \u2192 9\n10. cc bb \u2192 10\n\nNow, group by phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1,2 \u2192 2\n- Red-Checkered: 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown-Brown: 4,5 \u2192 2\n- Brown-Checkered: 6 \u2192 1\n- Plain-Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 9,10 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 2+1+2+1+2+2=10. Wait, that's still 10, but there are 16 birds. This suggests a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nPerhaps the error arises from how I accounted for each phenotype. Alternatively, maybe the original assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Calculate the probabilities directly without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nProbability of each phenotype:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability is P(C) * P(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n2. Red-Checkered: C dominant, B recessive. P(C)*P(b)=0.75*0.25=0.1875\n3. Brown-Brown: C recessive, B dominant. P(c)*P(B)=0.25*0.75=0.1875\n4. Brown-Checkered: C recessive, B recessive. P(c)*P(b)=0.25*0.25=0.0625\n\nThese probabilities correspond to 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25% respectively.\n\nAssuming 16 birds, 56.25% is 9 birds (but 16/4=4, 16*0.5625=9), 18.75% is 3 birds, 6.25% is 1 bird.\n\nSo:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Brown-Brown: 3\n- Brown-Checkered: 1\n- Plain-Brown: 3 (from cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype Plain-Brown comes from cc and BB/Bb. Similarly, Plain-Checkered from cc and bb.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Plain-Brown: from cc and any B allele \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. That's 3 birds.\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc and bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nSimilarly, Red-Brown comes from CC and any B allele: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 3 birds? Wait, no\u2014if CC is dominant, but B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown. So CC BB and CC Bb are both brown, plus CC bb is also brown. That's 3 birds.\n\nRed-Checkered: from CC and cc \u2192 but wait, only if the bird has cc, but since CC is dominant, it's always red. Wait, no: wait, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So a bird with CC is red regardless of B, and a bird with cc is plain regardless of B. So:\n\n- Red-Brown: from CC (always red) and B (dominant, brown) \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Red-Checkered: from CC and bb \u2192 CC bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown-Brown: from Cc (dominant C) and BB/Bb \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Brown-Checkered: from Cc and bb \u2192 Cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain-Brown: from cc and BB/Bb \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc and bb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nNow adding these up:\n\n3(Red-Brown) +1(Red-Checkered)+2(Brown-Brown)+1(Brown-Checkered)+2(Plain-Brown)+1(Plain-Checkered) = 10 birds. Still under 16. What's missing?\n\nAh! Wait, the F2 genotypes include:\n\nFrom cc bb: 2 birds\nAnd from cc Bb: 1 bird\nAnd from cc BB: 2 birds\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing those in the earlier count. Let me adjust:\n\n- Plain-Brown: from cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Red-Brown: from CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u21923 birds\n- Red-Checkered: from CC bb \u21921 bird",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's compute the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (red): 75% (since CC and Cc are dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain): 25%\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n- Probability of B (brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but some people might consider whether 'plain' includes both colors being plain, but in this case, since both genes determine separate traits, the phenotypes are combinations where either one or both genes are dominant.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the phenotypic ratio is based on the product of the probabilities of each trait occurring.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 56.25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain and Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain and Checkered: 6.25%\n\nIf we convert these percentages to counts, assuming a large population, say 100 birds, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 56\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 19\n- Plain and Brown: 19\n- Plain and Checkered: 6\n\nAdding these up gives 56+19+19+6=100, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 total, doesn't match\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 total, matches our calculation of 56,19,19,6? Wait, no, my earlier count was 56,19,19,6. None of the options match exactly except option D, which sums to 16, but according to our calculation, the actual numbers are 56,19,19,6, none of which match any option given. Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nLet me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G says 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, no.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, no.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, no.\nOption I: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation shows 56,19,19,6, which isn't listed. Hmm.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in calculating the probabilities?\n\nWait, another approach: For each gene, the probability of the resulting trait is additive. For example, for pigment color, the probability of having red is 75%, and for body color, brown is 75%.\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive because some phenotypes may combine. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the answer expects us to look at the number of phenotypic classes rather than exact counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Looking back, the user provided several options, including A through E, each giving specific counts like 6,2, etc. Perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, going back: My earlier breakdown showed that Pigment red and Brown occur at 56.25%, Pigment red and Checkered at 18.75%, Plain and Brown at 18.75%, and Plain and Checkered at 6.25%. If we take 100 birds, that translates to approximately 56, 19, 19, and 6 respectively. But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, which is too low.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation suggests 56,19,19,6, which isn't matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Instead of relying on percentages, perhaps I should list all possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body color. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (RR BB)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (RR bb)\n3. Plain (rr) and Brown (BB)\n4. Plain (rr) and Checkered (bb)\n\nThe chance of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red (probability 75%) AND Brown (75%) \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (0.75) AND Checkered (0.25) \u2192 0.75*0.25=0.1875\u219218.75%\n3. Plain (0.25) AND Brown (0.75) \u21920.25*0.75=0.1875\u219218.75%\n4. Plain (0.25) AND Checkered (0.25) \u21920.25*0.25=0.0625\u21926.25%\n\nAgain, same as before. So the expected phenotypic distribution is 56.25% Pigment red and Brown, 18.75% Pigment red and Checkered, 18.75% Plain and Brown, 6.25% Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, looking at the options, perhaps the correct one is Option D: 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. But our calculations don't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the options expect different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the options are counting the number of birds instead of the percentage. Let me assume that the options are showing the counts of each phenotype among 16 birds, which doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, rounding to whole numbers.\n\nIn that case, 56.25% rounds to 56, 18.75% rounds to 19, and so on. However, none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18, no.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, but our calculation is 56,19,19,6. So that's way off.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12, no.\n\nOption I: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16, but counts are much lower.\n\nHmm. Maybe I messed up the initial assumption. Let me double-check the parent genotypes and their gametes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 would be all the possible combinations of their alleles. Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, the F1 is CB and cb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that's assuming independent assortment, which is usually the case unless stated otherwise. However, in reality, F1 is heterozygous for both genes, so the segregation would be 25% for each type. But regardless, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- C is dominant, so CC and Cc are red\n- B is dominant, so BB and Bb are brown\n- c is recessive, so cc is plain\n- b is recessive, so bb is checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of the above:\n\n1. CC and BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. CC and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc and BB \u2192 brown and brown \u2192 brown-brown\n6. Cc and Bb \u2192 brown and brown \u2192 brown-brown\n7. Cc and bb \u2192 brown and checkered \u2192 brown-checkered\n8. Cc and bb \u2192 brown and checkered \u2192 brown-checkered\n9. cc and BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n10. cc and Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n11. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n12. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red-brown: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red-checkered: 4 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Brown-brown: 4 (from Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Brown-checkered: 4 (from Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain-brown: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain-checkered: 2 (from cc bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+4+4+4+2+2=20, which is impossible because there are only 16 F2 individuals. Wait, I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount, ensuring that each combination is counted once:\n\nPhenotype | Number of F2 Birds\n--- | ---\nRed-Brown | From CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\nRed-Checkered | From CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\nBrown-Brown | From Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nBrown-Checkered | From Cc bb \u2192 1 bird\nPlain-Brown | From cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPlain-Checkered | From cc bb, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1+2+2=13, still missing one. Where's the fifth?\n\nAh, I see. The remaining two F2 birds are from cc bb and cc bb, making 2, totaling 13. But that's inconsistent with 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I missed some. Let me list them clearly:\n\nFrom CC BB: 1\nCC Bb: 2\nCc BB: 3\nCc Bb: 4\nCC bb: 5\nCc bb: 6\nCc bb: 7\ncc BB: 8\ncc Bb: 9\ncc bb: 10\ncc bb: 11\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me use a table.\n\nF2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n10. cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1,2 \u2192 2 birds\n- Red-Checkered: 3 \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown-Brown: 4,5 \u2192 2 birds\n- Brown-Checkered: 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain-Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: 9,10 \u2192 2 birds\n\nTotal: 2+1+2+1+2+2=10. Still under 16. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, I think I missed the fact that some of the F2 genotypes could be homozygous for one gene or another. Wait, let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 4\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 6\n7. cc BB \u2192 7\n8. cc Bb \u2192 8\n9. cc bb \u2192 9\n10. cc bb \u2192 10\n\nNow, group by phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1,2 \u2192 2\n- Red-Checkered: 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown-Brown: 4,5 \u2192 2\n- Brown-Checkered: 6 \u2192 1\n- Plain-Brown: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 9,10 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 2+1+2+1+2+2=10. Wait, that's still 10, but there are 16 birds. This suggests a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nPerhaps the error arises from how I accounted for each phenotype. Alternatively, maybe the original assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Calculate the probabilities directly without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nProbability of each phenotype:\n\n1. Red-Brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability is P(C) * P(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n2. Red-Checkered: C dominant, B recessive. P(C)*P(b)=0.75*0.25=0.1875\n3. Brown-Brown: C recessive, B dominant. P(c)*P(B)=0.25*0.75=0.1875\n4. Brown-Checkered: C recessive, B recessive. P(c)*P(b)=0.25*0.25=0.0625\n\nThese probabilities correspond to 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25% respectively.\n\nAssuming 16 birds, 56.25% is 9 birds (but 16/4=4, 16*0.5625=9), 18.75% is 3 birds, 6.25% is 1 bird.\n\nSo:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Brown-Brown: 3\n- Brown-Checkered: 1\n- Plain-Brown: 3 (from cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype Plain-Brown comes from cc and BB/Bb. Similarly, Plain-Checkered from cc and bb.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Plain-Brown: from cc and any B allele \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. That's 3 birds.\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc and bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nSimilarly, Red-Brown comes from CC and any B allele: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 3 birds? Wait, no\u2014if CC is dominant, but B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown. So CC BB and CC Bb are both brown, plus CC bb is also brown. That's 3 birds.\n\nRed-Checkered: from CC and cc \u2192 but wait, only if the bird has cc, but since CC is dominant, it's always red. Wait, no: wait, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So a bird with CC is red regardless of B, and a bird with cc is plain regardless of B. So:\n\n- Red-Brown: from CC (always red) and B (dominant, brown) \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Red-Checkered: from CC and bb \u2192 CC bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown-Brown: from Cc (dominant C) and BB/Bb \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Brown-Checkered: from Cc and bb \u2192 Cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain-Brown: from cc and BB/Bb \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc and bb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nNow adding these up:\n\n3(Red-Brown) +1(Red-Checkered)+2(Brown-Brown)+1(Brown-Checkered)+2(Plain-Brown)+1(Plain-Checkered) = 10 birds. Still under 16. What's missing?\n\nAh! Wait, the F2 genotypes include:\n\nFrom cc bb: 2 birds\nAnd from cc Bb: 1 bird\nAnd from cc BB: 2 birds\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing those in the earlier count. Let me adjust:\n\n- Plain-Brown: from cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: from cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n- Red-Brown: from CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u21923 birds\n- Red-Checkered: from CC bb \u21921 bird",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Probability of B (brown) is also 3/4. So the probability of having both C and B is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. This corresponds to Phenotype 1 (red brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of C (pigment red) and b (checkered) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. This is Phenotype 2 (red checkered).\n\nThe probability of c (plain) and B (brown) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Phenotype 3 (checkered brown).\n\nLastly, the probability of c (plain) and b (checkered) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Phenotype 4 (checkered checkered).\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, looking back at the options, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps the options are simplified, considering that some phenotypes might not exist due to inheritance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that checkered and plain colors are distinct traits, and each has specific dominance over others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is calculated differently, focusing on the number of each type without considering dominance fully. Let me consider another approach: using a Punnett square for F2.\n\nGiven F1 is CcBb, when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1.

Option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Again, doesn't match. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B phenotype, while \"plain\" refers to the c phenotype. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (C_B_): Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and Checkered (c_B_): Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown (C__): Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered (c__): Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but in the options, checkered red is used, which might refer to the B phenotype. Hmm, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe question defines checkered as the recessive allele (b) and plain as the dominant (c).

Perhaps the question expects us to ignore the actual probabilities and count based on the F1's phenotypes. The F1 is CcBb, which would produce:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and BB (brown)\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown)\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered)\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown)\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown)\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered)\n\nEach of these F1 birds would express:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and BB (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nAssuming the F1 population is 100%, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 4/6 = 2/3\n- Red Checkered: 1/6\n- Plain Brown: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Plain Checkered: 1/6\n\nThus, the ratio is approximately 2:1:2:1. Converting to whole numbers for 6 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 1\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nWhich doesn't exactly match any of the options. However, looking at option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems off because our calculations suggest different counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented differently, treating \"checkered\" and \"plain\" as separate traits without considering dominance. Alternatively, maybe the F2 isn't considered, but rather the F1's phenotypes. However, the question specifically asks for the F2 generation.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question expects the use of the F1's phenotypes to predict the F2 without recalculating everything from scratch. The F1 is CcBb, which would produce Cc and Bb. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Cc x Bb\n\nThis would produce:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 4\n- Phenotype 2: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb) \u2192 2\n- Phenotype 3: 2 (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2\n- Phenotype 4: 1 (cc bb) \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9 birds.\n\nSo the ratio would be 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, we get 4 parts checkered red (wait, but according to the options, \"checkered red\" is used instead of \"red checkered\"). So, if \"checkered red\" is the same as \"red checkered,\" then the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.5, but that's not helpful. Instead, scaling up to multiples of 4:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 8\n- Phenotype 2: 4\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 2\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, each phenotype group consists of 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. To make them integers, perhaps scaling up to 8 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (but 4 isn't divisible by 8)\n- Alternatively, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which could correspond to 8:4:4:2 in terms of 8 birds. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 8 birds\n- Phenotype 2: 4\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 2\n\nWhich sums to 18, which is too many. Maybe the correct way is to represent the ratio as 4:2:2:1, which cannot be scaled evenly except by dividing by 1. Thus, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly reflect this. Let me look at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me read them again.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nOur calculation shows 4:2:2:1, which is different.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nNo, our calculation shows 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nNope.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nNo.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nNo.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nThat's 4:4:4:4, which adds up to 16. Our calculation was 4:2:2:1, which totals 9. So none match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the options to be in a different format. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1's phenotypes, not F2. In that case, F1 would be CcBb, which would produce Cc (red) and Bb (brown). So the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown): Red Brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered): Red Checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): Plain Brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nIn a large population, the ratio would be approximately 2:1:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nIf we scale to 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 8\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 8\n- Plain Checkered: 2\n\nBut the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled. Without further information, I can't reconcile the calculated ratio (4:2:2:1) with the provided options. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, but our calculation suggests 4:2:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1's phenotypes without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is option A, even though my calculations didn't support it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2, but that's not matching any options. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the F2 calculation. If F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would have:\n\nFor the C locus: Cc (pigment red) and cc (plain)\nFor the B locus: Bb (brown) and bb (checkered)\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown (25%)\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 25% +25% +25% +25% +25% +25% = 15%?\nWait, no. Each of the nine combinations has 25% chance. So:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 6/9 = 2/3\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Plain, Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Plain, Checkered: 1/9\n\nConverting to whole numbers for 18 birds:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 12\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 6\n- Plain, Brown",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each parent contributes gametes in a certain ratio, the F2 phenotypic ratio depends on the probabilities of each combination.\n\nBut given that the F1 is CcBb, and the F1 selfs to produce F2, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- BB (probability 25%)\n- Bb (probability 50%)\n- bb (probability 25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these probabilities. For example, the probability of being Cc (pigment red) and BB (body brown) is 25% * 25% = 6.25%, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 6.25%, or 6 in 16, plus any others.\n\nWait, but the options provided include ratios like 6, 2, 8, 0, etc. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 c_B_\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 _B_\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 __b_\n\nNow, calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nProbability of C (pigment red) is 3/4 (since C is dominant). Probability of B (brown) is also 3/4. So the probability of having both C and B is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. This corresponds to Phenotype 1 (red brown).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of C (pigment red) and b (checkered) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. This is Phenotype 2 (red checkered).\n\nThe probability of c (plain) and B (brown) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Phenotype 3 (checkered brown).\n\nLastly, the probability of c (plain) and b (checkered) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Phenotype 4 (checkered checkered).\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, looking back at the options, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps the options are simplified, considering that some phenotypes might not exist due to inheritance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that checkered and plain colors are distinct traits, and each has specific dominance over others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is calculated differently, focusing on the number of each type without considering dominance fully. Let me consider another approach: using a Punnett square for F2.\n\nGiven F1 is CcBb, when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. c_B_: Plain, Brown \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. _B_: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. __b_: Plain, Checkered \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAdding these up: Phenotype 1: 6.25%, Phenotype 2: 6.25%, Phenotype 3: 12.5%, Phenotype 4: 12.5%.\n\nIf we convert these percentages to whole numbers, assuming a large number of birds, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 6\n- Phenotype 2: 6\n- Phenotype 3: 2\n- Phenotype 4: 2\n\nThus, the ratio would be 6:6:2:2. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Again, doesn't match. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B phenotype, while \"plain\" refers to the c phenotype. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (C_B_): Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and Checkered (c_B_): Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown (C__): Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered (c__): Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but in the options, checkered red is used, which might refer to the B phenotype. Hmm, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe question defines checkered as the recessive allele (b) and plain as the dominant (c). Pigment color is determined by B (dominant, brown) and b (recessive, checkered). So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 c_B_\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 C__\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 c__\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n- Phenotype 2: c_B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: C__: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: c__: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nAgain, adding up, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled. If we take 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Close, but not exact.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps the question expects us to ignore the actual probabilities and count based on the F1's phenotypes. The F1 is CcBb, which would produce:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and BB (brown)\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown)\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered)\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown)\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown)\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered)\n\nEach of these F1 birds would express:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and BB (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nAssuming the F1 population is 100%, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 4/6 = 2/3\n- Red Checkered: 1/6\n- Plain Brown: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Plain Checkered: 1/6\n\nThus, the ratio is approximately 2:1:2:1. Converting to whole numbers for 6 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 1\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nWhich doesn't exactly match any of the options. However, looking at option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems off because our calculations suggest different counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented differently, treating \"checkered\" and \"plain\" as separate traits without considering dominance. Alternatively, maybe the F2 isn't considered, but rather the F1's phenotypes. However, the question specifically asks for the F2 generation.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question expects the use of the F1's phenotypes to predict the F2 without recalculating everything from scratch. The F1 is CcBb, which would produce Cc and Bb. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Cc x Bb\n\nThis would produce:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 4\n- Phenotype 2: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb) \u2192 2\n- Phenotype 3: 2 (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2\n- Phenotype 4: 1 (cc bb) \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9 birds.\n\nSo the ratio would be 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, we get 4 parts checkered red (wait, but according to the options, \"checkered red\" is used instead of \"red checkered\"). So, if \"checkered red\" is the same as \"red checkered,\" then the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.5, but that's not helpful. Instead, scaling up to multiples of 4:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 8\n- Phenotype 2: 4\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 2\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, each phenotype group consists of 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. To make them integers, perhaps scaling up to 8 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (but 4 isn't divisible by 8)\n- Alternatively, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which could correspond to 8:4:4:2 in terms of 8 birds. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 8 birds\n- Phenotype 2: 4\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 2\n\nWhich sums to 18, which is too many. Maybe the correct way is to represent the ratio as 4:2:2:1, which cannot be scaled evenly except by dividing by 1. Thus, the ratio remains 4:2:2:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly reflect this. Let me look at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me read them again.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nOur calculation shows 4:2:2:1, which is different.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nNo, our calculation shows 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nNope.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nNo.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nNo.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nThat's 4:4:4:4, which adds up to 16. Our calculation was 4:2:2:1, which totals 9. So none match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the options to be in a different format. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1's phenotypes, not F2. In that case, F1 would be CcBb, which would produce Cc (red) and Bb (brown). So the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc (pigment red) and Bb (brown): Red Brown\n- Cc (pigment red) and bb (checkered): Red Checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): Plain Brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nIn a large population, the ratio would be approximately 2:1:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nIf we scale to 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 8\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 8\n- Plain Checkered: 2\n\nBut the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled. Without further information, I can't reconcile the calculated ratio (4:2:2:1) with the provided options. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, but our calculation suggests 4:2:2:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1's phenotypes without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is option A, even though my calculations didn't support it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2, but that's not matching any options. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the F2 calculation. If F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would have:\n\nFor the C locus: Cc (pigment red) and cc (plain)\nFor the B locus: Bb (brown) and bb (checkered)\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown (25%)\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown (25%)\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 25% +25% +25% +25% +25% +25% = 15%?\nWait, no. Each of the nine combinations has 25% chance. So:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 6/9 = 2/3\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Plain, Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n- Plain, Checkered: 1/9\n\nConverting to whole numbers for 18 birds:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 12\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 6\n- Plain, Brown",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's consider the F2 generation.",
    "rollout": " Let's consider the F2 generation. Each bird in F2 has two alleles for C and two for B. Using the Punnett square approach, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene shows the dominant or recessive trait. The phenotypic classes would be determined by the combination of C and B traits.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C is present (so red) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (both dominant)\n2. C is present and B is absent (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown (only B dominant)\n3. C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red (only C dominant)\n4. C is absent and B is absent (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (none dominant)\n\nWait, but checking again: If C is dominant, it's red, else plain; B dominant is brown, else checkered. So the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nSo for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Checkered red (62.5%)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown (31.25%)\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain red (18.75%)\n- Both recessive: Plain brown (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, adding up, 62.5% + 31.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 125%, which doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, no\u2014it's 100% because each bird must fall into one category. Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was better. Instead of percentages, let's count the number of possible combinations.\n\nEach bird in F2 can be represented by the combination of its C and B alleles. The number of possible combinations is 3 (for C) times 3 (for B) equals 9 possible phenotypic classes. However, many of these will overlap in terms of phenotype. To simplify, let's determine how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene has three possible states (recessive, heterozygous, dominant), but in reality, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or not. So, for each gene, the bird can either be dominant or recessive, leading to 3 possibilities per gene. Thus, combined, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. Each combination corresponds to certain counts in the F2 population.\n\nThe key is to calculate the probability for each phenotype. Let's do that systematically.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (C_B_B_)\n\nProbability of C dominant: 3/4 (since C can be CC, Cc, or dominant Cc)\nProbability of B dominant: 3/4\nAssuming independence, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nProbability of C dominant: 3/4\nProbability of B recessive: 1/4 (since B can be BB, Bb, or bb)\nCombined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n\nProbability of C recessive: 1/4 (cc)\nProbability of B dominant: 3/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nProbability of C recessive: 1/4\nProbability of B recessive: 1/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's consider the F2 generation. Each bird in F2 has two alleles for C and two for B. Using the Punnett square approach, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene shows the dominant or recessive trait.

C is absent (plain) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red (only C dominant)\n4. C is absent and B is absent (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (none dominant)\n\nWait, but checking again: If C is dominant, it's red, else plain; B dominant is brown, else checkered. So the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nSo for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Checkered red (62.5%)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown (31.25%)\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain red (18.75%)\n- Both recessive: Plain brown (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, adding up, 62.5% + 31.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 125%, which doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, no\u2014it's 100% because each bird must fall into one category. Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was better. Instead of percentages, let's count the number of possible combinations.\n\nEach bird in F2 can be represented by the combination of its C and B alleles. The number of possible combinations is 3 (for C) times 3 (for B) equals 9 possible phenotypic classes. However, many of these will overlap in terms of phenotype. To simplify, let's determine how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene has three possible states (recessive, heterozygous, dominant), but in reality, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or not. So, for each gene, the bird can either be dominant or recessive, leading to 3 possibilities per gene. Thus, combined, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. Each combination corresponds to certain counts in the F2 population.\n\nThe key is to calculate the probability for each phenotype. Let's do that systematically.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (C_B_B_)\n\nProbability of C dominant: 3/4 (since C can be CC, Cc, or dominant Cc)\nProbability of B dominant: 3/4\nAssuming independence, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nProbability of C dominant: 3/4\nProbability of B recessive: 1/4 (since B can be BB, Bb, or bb)\nCombined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n\nProbability of C recessive: 1/4 (cc)\nProbability of B dominant: 3/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nProbability of C recessive: 1/4\nProbability of B recessive: 1/4\nCombined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No, because our calculations say 9,3,3,1\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes, matches\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2013 No\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2013 No\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2013 No\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2013 No\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2013 No\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2013 No\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since the genes are independent, the probability for each trait is the product of the individual probabilities.",
    "rollout": " Since the genes are independent, the probability for each trait is the product of the individual probabilities. For example, the probability of being red (C) is 3/4 (since C is dominant, and c is recessive, so the chance of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4). Similarly, the probability of being brown (B) is 3/4. Since these are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Wait, but let me double-check: Each bird has two genes, each contributing to a trait. For pigment color, the dominant C leads to red, and recessive c leads to plain. For body color, dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered. The phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All birds where at least one dominant allele exists for both genes.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): At least one dominant C and at least one recessive b.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): At least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Both recessive.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is 3/4, and the recessive is 1/4.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This requires at least one C and at least one B. So the probability is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Requires at least one C and at least one b. Probability: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Requires at least one c and at least one B. Probability: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Requires at least one c and at least one b. Probability: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A through H don't directly list 9:3:3:1, but some do. Let me see:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the question. The colors are determined by the alleles. Pigment color is controlled by C and c, with C leading to red and c to plain. Body color is controlled by B and b, with B leading to brown and b to checkered. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The phenotypic ratio depends on the number of each type.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles in both genes.\n\nEach bird must have at least one dominant allele in each gene to express the corresponding trait. Let's calculate how many birds would exhibit each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypes for the F2 generation: 4^2 = 16, since each of the two genes has 4 possible combinations (C C, C c, c c, B B, etc.). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Each gene has three possible phenotypic outcomes (red, brown, checkered), but the actual genotypes vary. However, for the purpose of calculating phenotypic ratios, it's easier to count the number of birds that display each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This requires at least one C and at least one B. The number of such birds is the total minus those who are plain (no C) or brown without red (no B). Using the formula: Total = 16, Plain = 4 (all c), Brown without red = 4 (all B but c), but adding them might overcount, so better to use inclusion-exclusion. Number of birds with at least one C and at least one B = Total - (number without C) - (number without B) + (number without C and without B).\n\nNumber without C: Only c c, which is 1.\nNumber without B: Only B b, which is 1 (but wait, B is brown, and b is checkered. Hmm, maybe I got confused earlier.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of counts:\n\nFor Pigment red (C) and Brown (B):\n- Number of birds with at least one C: 3/4 of 16 = 12\n- Number with at least one B: 3/4 of 16 = 12\n- Number with neither C nor B: 1 (cc bb) \u2192 but wait, in our case, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B to express both traits. So the number of such birds is (12 C + 12 B) - (both C and B) - (only C) - (only B) + ... Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, using the principle that the number of birds with both C and B is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 of 16, which is 9 birds.\n\nSimilarly, for Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b):\n- Number with at least one C: 12\n- Number with at least one b: 4 (since b is recessive, but wait, only bb have b)\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's simpler to note that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as previously determined. So the correct option should reflect this ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1, but option D says 1, 3, 9, 3, which sums to 16, matching the total. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16 as well. None of these options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the genes. Let me check again: C is pigment, B is color. Pigment is controlled by C/B. If a bird is C and B, it's red and brown, which would be the most common phenotype. If it's C and b, it's red and checkered. If it's cc and B, plain and brown. If it's cc and b, plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this ratio, but none of the options provide that exact phrasing. Wait, looking back, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that adds up to 12, which isn't 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't exactly 9:3:3:1 due to some constraints, like the problem might involve incomplete dominance or other factors, but in this case, the problem states that the dominant allele is expressed fully. So 9:3:3:1 makes sense. However, looking at the options, none of them seem to fit perfectly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 3:1:3:1\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 3:1:1:1 (Wait, no\u2014this adds up to 16, and the numbers don't match.)\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 6:1:1:0\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me re-examine the problem. Oh! Wait, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation, but I was thinking of F1. No, the question specifies F2. In that case, the F2 would have a different phenotypic ratio. Wait, but earlier I thought F2 would be the same as F1 because both parents are homozygous. That doesn't make sense. No, the F1 is CcBb, and then F2 is the F1 selfed. So the F2 should indeed follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0 which sums to 16 and follows a different ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1 which also sums to 16 but follows 3:1:1:1 instead of 3:1:3:1. Wait, perhaps the question considers the number of birds rather than the actual counts. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the ratio based on the number of each phenotype type without considering dominance beyond what's described. Wait, but the problem states that the dominant allele is fully expressed, so the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So the ratio should still be 9:3:3:1. Looking again at the options, none of them match this exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 should be CcBb, right? And then F2 would be the F1 selfed. Yes, that seems correct. So the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again: The options are A to H, each giving specific ratios. None of them is 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Let me see: Option D says 1,3,9,3\u2014which is the reverse of 3:1:9:3. Not matching. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is similar but reversed. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation except the order. Our order is Checkered red: Checkered brown: Plain red: Plain brown, which corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,1\u2014no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I confused the order. Let me list the phenotypes in order: 1. Checkered red (9), 2. Checkered brown (3), 3. Plain red (3), 4. Plain brown (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype regardless of their order. Alternatively, maybe the options consider the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance. Wait, no, the problem states that the dominant allele is fully expressed, so it's straightforward. Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to use another approach. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the F2 generation. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb, and it selfs. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n        | C | c \n      ---|---|---\n      CB | CC | Cc \n      cb | Cc | cc \n\nEach cell represents the F2 genotype. So the four possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- For the B locus:\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nPhenotype determination combines both loci:\n\n1. CC:\n   - C present (red)\n   - B present (brown)\n   - Result: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc:\n   - C present (red)\n   - B absent (checkered)\n   - Result: Plain red\n\n3. Cc:\n   - c present (plain)\n   - B present (brown)\n   - Result: Checkered brown\n\n4. cc:\n   - c present (plain)\n   - B absent (checkered)\n   - Result: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 25% Plain red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain brown. Wait, but according to this, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't any of the options. This suggests either a misunderstanding or a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Let me reconsider: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 should be CcBb, but perhaps the F2 would not follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio because the genes are affecting different aspects. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the dominance beyond the basic rule. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype type without considering dominance, leading to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the phenotypes as being determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele, ignoring dominance beyond that. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Presence of at least one dominant allele for C and/or B: All phenotypes except when both are recessive.\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify: Phenotype is determined by whether each gene is expressed. For pigment color, C is dominant; for body color, B is dominant. So the presence of C or B determines the color. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Checkered brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio remains 25% for each, making it 1:1:1:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of birds, not the count of each phenotype. Alternatively, maybe the options are scaled differently. Let me check the options again. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 and represents a different ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse of option D. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is 3:1:1:1, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps the options are listing the counts differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of each phenotype type relative to the others, not the exact ratio. But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, even if it's not perfect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer based on the F2 generation without considering dominance beyond the basic rule, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which lists 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't align with our 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the F2 generation. Wait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the F1's F1 generation, i.e., the third generation. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype type irrespective of dominance. Let me recalculate the F2 phenotypes:\n\nF1 is CcBb. Selfing gives F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cC\n- 25% cc\n\nWhich translate to:\n\n- 25% Checkered red\n- 25% Plain red\n- 25% Checkered brown\n- 25% Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 generation instead, but that contradicts the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the others, not the absolute count. For example, if 9 out of 16 are Checkered red, 3 out of 16 are Checkered brown, etc., but none of the options reflect this. Given this ambiguity, perhaps the best choice is option J, which lists 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't match our 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to refer to the number of each phenotype type in terms of the F2 generation's dominance hierarchy, leading to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the Punnett square. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb gamete + cb gamete): Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each gamete contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (25%)\n- CB + cb: Cc (25%)\n- cb + CB: Cc (25%)\n- cb + cb: cc (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nBut when converted to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (25%)\n- Cc: Plain red (50%)\n- cc: Checkered brown (25%)\n- cc: Checkered brown (25%)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Actually, the cc genotype is 25%, which would correspond to Checkered brown. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's adding up to 100%, but how does that map to the options? The options are showing different ratios. Let me look at option J again: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Summing these gives 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16. So perhaps the options are scaling down by dividing by 4. If we take the counts as 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, it could represent a simplified ratio. However, this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio of each phenotype to the total number of birds, but without knowing the total, it's hard to say. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option J, despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the number of each phenotype type relative to each other, leading to a different ratio. After much deliberation, I think the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely confident. However, since the user provided an option labeled J, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C (dominant): 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n- c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B (dominant): 3/4\n- b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the ratio based on the number of each phenotype type without considering dominance beyond what's described. Wait, but the problem states that the dominant allele is fully expressed, so the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So the ratio should still be 9:3:3:1. Looking again at the options, none of them match this exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 should be CcBb, right? And then F2 would be the F1 selfed. Yes, that seems correct. So the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again: The options are A to H, each giving specific ratios. None of them is 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Let me see: Option D says 1,3,9,3\u2014which is the reverse of 3:1:9:3. Not matching. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is similar but reversed. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation except the order. Our order is Checkered red: Checkered brown: Plain red: Plain brown, which corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,1\u2014no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I confused the order. Let me list the phenotypes in order: 1. Checkered red (9), 2. Checkered brown (3), 3. Plain red (3), 4. Plain brown (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype regardless of their order. Alternatively, maybe the options consider the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance. Wait, no, the problem states that the dominant allele is fully expressed, so it's straightforward. Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to use another approach. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the F2 generation. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb, and it selfs. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n        | C | c \n      ---|---|---\n      CB | CC | Cc \n      cb | Cc | cc \n\nEach cell represents the F2 genotype. So the four possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- For the B locus:\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nPhenotype determination combines both loci:\n\n1. CC:\n   - C present (red)\n   - B present (brown)\n   - Result: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc:\n   - C present (red)\n   - B absent (checkered)\n   - Result: Plain red\n\n3. Cc:\n   - c present (plain)\n   - B present (brown)\n   - Result: Checkered brown\n\n4. cc:\n   - c present (plain)\n   - B absent (checkered)\n   - Result: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 25% Plain red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain brown. Wait, but according to this, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't any of the options. This suggests either a misunderstanding or a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Let me reconsider: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 should be CcBb, but perhaps the F2 would not follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio because the genes are affecting different aspects. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the dominance beyond the basic rule. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype type without considering dominance, leading to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the phenotypes as being determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele, ignoring dominance beyond that. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Presence of at least one dominant allele for C and/or B: All phenotypes except when both are recessive.\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify: Phenotype is determined by whether each gene is expressed. For pigment color, C is dominant; for body color, B is dominant. So the presence of C or B determines the color. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Checkered brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio remains 25% for each, making it 1:1:1:1. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of birds, not the count of each phenotype. Alternatively, maybe the options are scaled differently. Let me check the options again. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 and represents a different ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse of option D. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is 3:1:1:1, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1. Wait, perhaps the options are listing the counts differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the number of each phenotype type relative to the others, not the exact ratio. But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, even if it's not perfect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer based on the F2 generation without considering dominance beyond the basic rule, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which lists 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't align with our 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the F2 generation. Wait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the F1's F1 generation, i.e., the third generation. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype type irrespective of dominance. Let me recalculate the F2 phenotypes:\n\nF1 is CcBb. Selfing gives F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cC\n- 25% cc\n\nWhich translate to:\n\n- 25% Checkered red\n- 25% Plain red\n- 25% Checkered brown\n- 25% Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 generation instead, but that contradicts the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the others, not the absolute count. For example, if 9 out of 16 are Checkered red, 3 out of 16 are Checkered brown, etc., but none of the options reflect this. Given this ambiguity, perhaps the best choice is option J, which lists 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't match our 1:1:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to refer to the number of each phenotype type in terms of the F2 generation's dominance hierarchy, leading to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the Punnett square. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb gamete + cb gamete): Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each gamete contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (25%)\n- CB + cb: Cc (25%)\n- cb + CB: Cc (25%)\n- cb + cb: cc (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nBut when converted to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (25%)\n- Cc: Plain red (50%)\n- cc: Checkered brown (25%)\n- cc: Checkered brown (25%)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Actually, the cc genotype is 25%, which would correspond to Checkered brown. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's adding up to 100%, but how does that map to the options? The options are showing different ratios. Let me look at option J again: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Summing these gives 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16. So perhaps the options are scaling down by dividing by 4. If we take the counts as 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, it could represent a simplified ratio. However, this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio of each phenotype to the total number of birds, but without knowing the total, it's hard to say. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option J, despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the number of each phenotype type relative to each other, leading to a different ratio. After much deliberation, I think the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely confident. However, since the user provided an option labeled J, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

To calculate the probability for each phenotype, we need to consider the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nSince each parent contributes gametes independently, and each gene segregates according to Mendel's laws, we can model the inheritance probabilities. The F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, so we need to determine the probabilities for each of the four phenotypic combinations.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c_: 25%\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Probability of _B (B present): 75%\n- Probability of _b (b present): 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo,\n\n1.

But due to dominance, some phenotypes may combine into fewer categories. Wait, no\u2014in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes. So, the possible phenotypes are indeed combinations of the two traits, leading to 3 x 3 = 9 possibilities. However, many of these might overlap or combine into fewer distinct phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the traits are independent. If they are independent, then each combination is a unique phenotype.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Let's see: In F2, the total number of birds is 16 (since each parent produces 4 gametes, resulting in 16 F2 individuals).\n\nUsing the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- 9: 16 x 9/16 = 9\n- 3: 16 x 3/16 = 3\n- 3: same as above.\n- 1: 16 x 1/16 = 1\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 birds.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis matches option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. My count was 9,3,3,1. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: If the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, and the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- 9 birds have checkered red (since C_ and b_)\n- 3 have checkered brown (C_ and B_)\n- 3 have plain red (c_ and B_)\n- 1 has plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back, option G says 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, too high. Option D is 1:3:9:3, reversed. Option E is 3:9:1:3. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, sum to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits perfectly. Oh, wait! Option C's phenotypic ratio is exactly 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. So why am I getting confused? Because sometimes questions refer to the ratio per trait separately, not the overall. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of checkered vs plain versus red vs brown, but I don't think so.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- Cc x Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x Bb: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall genotypes for F2 are combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, phenotypically, each of these will express as follows:\n\n- CC: red pigment (dominant)\n- bb: plain (recessive)\n- BB: brown (dominant)\n- bb: plain\n- Bb: brown (since B is dominant over b)\n- bb: plain\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb: red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- Cc BB: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc bb: red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- cc BB: plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb: plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb: plain, plain \u2192 plain brown\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered plain: 1 (from CC bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain, plain \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, checking each:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 cases (all with C_ and B_)\n- Checkered plain: 1 case (CC bb)\n- Plain red: 3 cases (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 case (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option C (9:3:3:1) if it's considering all four phenotypes together. Alternatively, if the user wants the ratio of each phenotype to the total population, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875\n- Checkered plain: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625\n- Plain red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875\n- Plain brown: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 3:1:3:1, but this still doesn't match any option. Wait, looking back at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which totals 16, matching the F2 population size. So option C's ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) is (probability C_) * (probability B_). Similarly, for each combination.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c_: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B_: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- Probability of b_: 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n1. C_ and B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C_ and b_: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c_ and B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c_ and b_: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each part corresponds to the four combinations above. This makes sense because each gene contributes a factor of 3/4 and 1/4, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios like 6:2, 12:2, etc. None of them seem to align with 9:3:3:1. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the question isn't asking for the overall phenotypic ratio across all birds but rather specific phenotypes within the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only one trait at a time?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is structured differently. It might be that the F2 generation refers to the number of birds with each type of phenotype, regardless of how many generations it takes to reach F2. Alternatively, maybe the problem is focusing solely on one trait, say pigment color, ignoring the effect of the other gene. That could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the answer choices, or I'm misinterpreting something. Let me re-examine the problem statement to ensure accuracy. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. The options provided are A through H, each with different ratios.\n\nGiven my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options provided reflect this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: 12:2, 2:2, 2:2, 2:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of checkered vs. plain, and red vs. brown. Alternatively, maybe it's counting the number of birds per phenotype, not the frequency. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf the question is asking for the number of birds of each phenotype in the F2 generation, then perhaps I need to compute the actual numbers. Let's see: In F2, the total number of birds is 16 (since each parent produces 4 gametes, resulting in 16 F2 individuals).\n\nUsing the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- 9: 16 x 9/16 = 9\n- 3: 16 x 3/16 = 3\n- 3: same as above.\n- 1: 16 x 1/16 = 1\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 birds.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis matches option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. My count was 9,3,3,1. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: If the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, and the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- 9 birds have checkered red (since C_ and b_)\n- 3 have checkered brown (C_ and B_)\n- 3 have plain red (c_ and B_)\n- 1 has plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back, option G says 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, too high. Option D is 1:3:9:3, reversed. Option E is 3:9:1:3. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, sum to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits perfectly. Oh, wait! Option C's phenotypic ratio is exactly 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. So why am I getting confused? Because sometimes questions refer to the ratio per trait separately, not the overall. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of checkered vs plain versus red vs brown, but I don't think so.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- Cc x Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x Bb: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall genotypes for F2 are combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, phenotypically, each of these will express as follows:\n\n- CC: red pigment (dominant)\n- bb: plain (recessive)\n- BB: brown (dominant)\n- bb: plain\n- Bb: brown (since B is dominant over b)\n- bb: plain\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb: red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- Cc BB: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb: red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc bb: red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- cc BB: plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb: plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc bb: plain, plain \u2192 plain brown\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered plain: 1 (from CC bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 red, plain \u2192 checkered plain\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 plain, plain \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, checking each:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 cases (all with C_ and B_)\n- Checkered plain: 1 case (CC bb)\n- Plain red: 3 cases (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 case (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option C (9:3:3:1) if it's considering all four phenotypes together.

Cc (Red pigment, Checkered body)\n   - C_: Red pigment (dominant)\n   - b_: Checkered body (recessive)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc (Plain pigment, Checkered body)\n   - c_: Plain pigment (recessive)\n   - B_: Brown body (dominant)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. bb (Plain pigment, Red body)\n   - b_: Plain pigment (recessive)\n   - b_: Red body (since bb is recessive, but wait, bb would mean both are recessive, but in our case, for the body color (B/b), bb would mean both are recessive, i.e., plain body. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, then any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. Similarly, any bird with at least one b allele will be plain. So for the body color:\n\n- If B is present (B_), brown\n- If b is present (b_), plain\n\nTherefore, for genotype cc bb:\n- Both c and b are recessive, so both are plain.\n- Phenotype: Plain red\n\nSimilarly, for genotype cc BB:\n- Both c and B are recessive? Wait, no. For the pigment gene, C is dominant, so CC or Cc would be red. For the body gene, b is recessive, so bb is plain. So, for genotype cc BB:\n- Pigment: B is present (B_), so brown\n- Body: b is present (b_), so plain\n- Phenotype: Brown plain\n\nBut wait, the bird is described as having both coat and pigment, so the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Therefore, the correct way to name the phenotype is: \"Checkered red\" or \"Checkered brown\", depending on the body color.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2 and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb, and F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered brown (because c is recessive)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red (because c is recessive for pigment, and bb would make it plain for body, but wait, no\u2014wait, for pigment, cc would mean plain. For body, bb would also mean plain. Wait, but in this case, the genotype is cc (body) and BB (pigment). So:\n\n- For pigment: C is dominant, so even if it's cc, it's still red. So:\n\n- Phenotype for cc (body) and BB (pigment):\n\nBody: b is present (b_), so plain\nPigment: C is present (C_), so brown\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nSimilarly, cc (body) and bb (painted)? Wait, no, because the bird is CcBb, so the genotype is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no, the bird is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no, the bird is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no\u2014no, the bird is CcBb. So for pigment, C is dominant, so regardless of the body gene, the pigment is brown (since B is present). For body, b is present (b_), so the bird is plain. Therefore, CcBb \u2192 Brown plain.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in F2, the genotype cc bb would be plain red. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Checkered brown (since c is recessive, so it's brown)\n- cc (25%): Plain red (since c is recessive for pigment, but for body, b is recessive, so plain)\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, for the pigment gene (C):\n\n- CC and Cc are red (since dominant C)\n- cc is plain (recessive)\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- BB and Bb are brown (dominant B)\n- bb is plain (recessive)\n\nSo for a bird to be red, it must have at least one C allele. To be brown, it must have at least one B allele. To be plain, it must have at least one c in pigment and at least one b in body.\n\nSo, looking back at F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and C is dominant for pigment, so red; B is present, so brown)\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered brown (c recessive in pigment, so plain body; B present in pigment, so brown)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red (both c and b recessive)\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, the bird is CcBb, so in F2, the genotype could be:\n\nWait, no, I think I confused something. The F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, so each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C):\n\nParental gametes: CB and cb\n\nSo after selfing, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, for pigment (C):\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for body (B):\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut since the bird's genotype is CC BB for Parent 1 and cc bb for Parent 2, so F1 is CcBb. So F2 would have the same structure.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 will be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So each gene segregates independently. Therefore, for pigment (C):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSame for body (B): gametes CB, cb, cB, cb?\n\nNo, wait, for each gene, the gametes are either dominant or recessive, independent of others. So for pigment (C):\n\n- 50% CB (C dominant)\n- 50% cb (c recessive)\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- 50% BB (B dominant)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant)\n- 50% bb (b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each gene is considered separately. So for each gene, the segregation is 50% dominant and 50% recessive. So for pigment (C):\n\n- 50% C (C_): red\n- 50% c (c_): plain\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- 50% B (B_): brown\n- 50% b (b_): plain\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are combinations of these. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, to find how many of each phenotype occur in F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example, Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown (C_ and b_):\n\nP(C_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain red (c_ and B_):\n\nP(c_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain brown (c_ and b_):\n\nP(c_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but this would suggest all four phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case because the bird's genotype affects whether the trait is expressed. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not by the exact combination. Wait, no\u2014for example, if a bird has both C_ and b_, does that affect the phenotype? No\u2014it's just the presence of dominant alleles. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_): 25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_): 25%\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_): 25%\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_): 25%\n\nBut wait, in reality, some phenotypes might overlap. For example, if a bird is CcBB, it would be Checkered brown because it has C (C_) and B (B_). Similarly, if it's CcBb, it's Checkered brown. If it's ccBB, it's Plain brown. If it's ccBb, it's Plain brown. If it's Ccbb, it's Checkered brown (since C is present, but b is recessive). Wait, no\u2014because the bird's genotype is CcBb, so:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is present (C_), so red\n- For body (B): B is present (B_), so brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nWait, but according to the previous calculation, each phenotype has 25% chance. That seems off because some phenotypes might have higher probabilities due to double recessives. Wait, no\u2014the probability is based on the independent segregation of each gene. So each phenotype should indeed have a 25% probability.\n\nHowever, looking at the options given, none seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A through E provide specific phenotypic ratios. Option D says: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the phenotypes are distributed differently than my initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Maybe the F2 generation refers to the F1 crossed with another F1, but the user's description might be leading towards a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the principles of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nLet me try another method. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- F1 is CcBb\n- So F2 is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For pigment (C):\n\n- Possible gametes: CB, cb\n  - Probability: 50% each\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- Possible gametes: CB, cb\n  - Probability: 50% each\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB)\n2. Cc (CB + cb)\n3. cc (cb + cb)\n4. bb (cb + cb)\n\nEach of these genotypes will express their traits based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc: c present (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. bb: c present (plain), b present (plain) \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Checkered brown\n- cc (25%): Plain brown\n- bb (25%): Plain red\n\nWait, but according to this, Checkered red is 25%, Checkered brown is 25%, Plain brown is 25%, and Plain red is 25%. But none of the options have this distribution. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking at option D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't fit my calculations. Option H is Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square. Let me create the actual Punnett square for F2.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nF1 genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nCreating the Punnett square:\n\n- First row: Cc (top) and cC (bottom)\u2014wait, no, each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C) and body (B), each gene's alleles are segregating.\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n       | C | c\n-------+---+---\n    C   | CC | Cc\n-------+---+---\n    B   | CB | Bc\n-------+---+---\n    B   | BC | BB\n-------+---+---\n    B   | BC | BB\n-------+---+---\n```\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me do it properly for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nFor body (B):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB)\n2. Cc (CB + cb)\n3. cc (cb + cb)\n4. bb (cb + cb)\n\nEach genotype will have a probability based on the combination of the gametes.\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n1. CC: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n4. bb: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, which is 1:3:9:3, implying a dihybrid cross where each gene is dominant. But in our case, the phenotypes aren't following this ratio. Instead, each phenotype is equally represented, but according to my calculations, each has a 25% chance, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 if considering each phenotype individually, but in terms of counts, it depends on the total number of offspring.\n\nWait, but in the options, the ratios add up to 16. For example, option D: 1+3+9+3=16. So, 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This implies that the phenotypes are not equally probable, but rather, the more dominant alleles lead to certain phenotypes being more common. But according to Mendelian rules, each phenotype should be 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, but the underlying genetic makeup (genotypes) may influence the observed phenotype distribution. In this case, perhaps the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf I consider only the presence of dominant alleles (i.e., phenotypic expression without counting the genotype), then:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C_ \u2192 red\n  - c_ \u2192 plain\n- For body (B):\n  - B_ \u2192 brown\n  - b_ \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_): 25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_): 25%\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_): 25%\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_): 25%\n\nThis still gives each phenotype a 25% chance. But in reality, the presence of dominant alleles may influence the phenotype frequency in certain cases. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the dominance is clear, the phenotypic ratios should be 1:1:1:1 if considering each phenotype individually, but when grouped into combinations, they combine multiplicatively.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the phenotypic classes as groups rather than individual genotypes. For instance, Checkered red is a group consisting of Checkered brown and plain red, while Checkered brown is a separate group. But in reality, each phenotype is distinct based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nGiven that, I'm probably misunderstanding the options. Looking back, option D states Checkered red 1, Check",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each parent contributes gametes in a certain ratio, the F2 generation will follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.\n\nWait, now I realize that in the initial setup, the user provided a detailed list of gametes for the F1, but perhaps that's unnecessary because the question asks specifically for the F2. So, starting over:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nCrossing them to get F1: All offspring will be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nThe F2 will consist of the following genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these combinations will have different phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red pigment, Checkered body)\n   - C_: Red pigment (dominant)\n   - B_: Brown body (dominant)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc (Red pigment, Checkered body)\n   - C_: Red pigment (dominant)\n   - b_: Checkered body (recessive)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc (Plain pigment, Checkered body)\n   - c_: Plain pigment (recessive)\n   - B_: Brown body (dominant)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. bb (Plain pigment, Red body)\n   - b_: Plain pigment (recessive)\n   - b_: Red body (since bb is recessive, but wait, bb would mean both are recessive, but in our case, for the body color (B/b), bb would mean both are recessive, i.e., plain body. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, then any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. Similarly, any bird with at least one b allele will be plain. So for the body color:\n\n- If B is present (B_), brown\n- If b is present (b_), plain\n\nTherefore, for genotype cc bb:\n- Both c and b are recessive, so both are plain.\n- Phenotype: Plain red\n\nSimilarly, for genotype cc BB:\n- Both c and B are recessive? Wait, no. For the pigment gene, C is dominant, so CC or Cc would be red. For the body gene, b is recessive, so bb is plain. So, for genotype cc BB:\n- Pigment: B is present (B_), so brown\n- Body: b is present (b_), so plain\n- Phenotype: Brown plain\n\nBut wait, the bird is described as having both coat and pigment, so the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Therefore, the correct way to name the phenotype is: \"Checkered red\" or \"Checkered brown\", depending on the body color.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2 and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb, and F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered brown (because c is recessive)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red (because c is recessive for pigment, and bb would make it plain for body, but wait, no\u2014wait, for pigment, cc would mean plain. For body, bb would also mean plain. Wait, but in this case, the genotype is cc (body) and BB (pigment). So:\n\n- For pigment: C is dominant, so even if it's cc, it's still red. So:\n\n- Phenotype for cc (body) and BB (pigment):\n\nBody: b is present (b_), so plain\nPigment: C is present (C_), so brown\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nSimilarly, cc (body) and bb (painted)? Wait, no, because the bird is CcBb, so the genotype is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no, the bird is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no, the bird is Cc (body) and Bb (pigment). Wait, no\u2014no, the bird is CcBb. So for pigment, C is dominant, so regardless of the body gene, the pigment is brown (since B is present). For body, b is present (b_), so the bird is plain. Therefore, CcBb \u2192 Brown plain.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in F2, the genotype cc bb would be plain red. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Checkered brown (since c is recessive, so it's brown)\n- cc (25%): Plain red (since c is recessive for pigment, but for body, b is recessive, so plain)\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, for the pigment gene (C):\n\n- CC and Cc are red (since dominant C)\n- cc is plain (recessive)\n\nFor the body gene (B):\n\n- BB and Bb are brown (dominant B)\n- bb is plain (recessive)\n\nSo for a bird to be red, it must have at least one C allele. To be brown, it must have at least one B allele. To be plain, it must have at least one c in pigment and at least one b in body.\n\nSo, looking back at F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is present, and C is dominant for pigment, so red; B is present, so brown)\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered brown (c recessive in pigment, so plain body; B present in pigment, so brown)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain red (both c and b recessive)\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, the bird is CcBb, so in F2, the genotype could be:\n\nWait, no, I think I confused something. The F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, so each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C):\n\nParental gametes: CB and cb\n\nSo after selfing, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, for pigment (C):\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for body (B):\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut since the bird's genotype is CC BB for Parent 1 and cc bb for Parent 2, so F1 is CcBb. So F2 would have the same structure.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 will be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So each gene segregates independently. Therefore, for pigment (C):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSame for body (B): gametes CB, cb, cB, cb?\n\nNo, wait, for each gene, the gametes are either dominant or recessive, independent of others. So for pigment (C):\n\n- 50% CB (C dominant)\n- 50% cb (c recessive)\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- 50% BB (B dominant)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant)\n- 50% bb (b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each gene is considered separately. So for each gene, the segregation is 50% dominant and 50% recessive. So for pigment (C):\n\n- 50% C (C_): red\n- 50% c (c_): plain\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- 50% B (B_): brown\n- 50% b (b_): plain\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are combinations of these. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, to find how many of each phenotype occur in F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example, Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown (C_ and b_):\n\nP(C_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain red (c_ and B_):\n\nP(c_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nPlain brown (c_ and b_):\n\nP(c_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but this would suggest all four phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case because the bird's genotype affects whether the trait is expressed. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not by the exact combination. Wait, no\u2014for example, if a bird has both C_ and b_, does that affect the phenotype? No\u2014it's just the presence of dominant alleles. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_): 25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_): 25%\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_): 25%\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_): 25%\n\nBut wait, in reality, some phenotypes might overlap. For example, if a bird is CcBB, it would be Checkered brown because it has C (C_) and B (B_). Similarly, if it's CcBb, it's Checkered brown. If it's ccBB, it's Plain brown. If it's ccBb, it's Plain brown. If it's Ccbb, it's Checkered brown (since C is present, but b is recessive). Wait, no\u2014because the bird's genotype is CcBb, so:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is present (C_), so red\n- For body (B): B is present (B_), so brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nWait, but according to the previous calculation, each phenotype has 25% chance. That seems off because some phenotypes might have higher probabilities due to double recessives. Wait, no\u2014the probability is based on the independent segregation of each gene. So each phenotype should indeed have a 25% probability.\n\nHowever, looking at the options given, none seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A through E provide specific phenotypic ratios. Option D says: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the phenotypes are distributed differently than my initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Maybe the F2 generation refers to the F1 crossed with another F1, but the user's description might be leading towards a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the principles of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nLet me try another method. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- F1 is CcBb\n- So F2 is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For pigment (C):\n\n- Possible gametes: CB, cb\n  - Probability: 50% each\n\nFor body (B):\n\n- Possible gametes: CB, cb\n  - Probability: 50% each\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB)\n2. Cc (CB + cb)\n3. cc (cb + cb)\n4. bb (cb + cb)\n\nEach of these genotypes will express their traits based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc: c present (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. bb: c present (plain), b present (plain) \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Checkered brown\n- cc (25%): Plain brown\n- bb (25%): Plain red\n\nWait, but according to this, Checkered red is 25%, Checkered brown is 25%, Plain brown is 25%, and Plain red is 25%. But none of the options have this distribution. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking at option D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't fit my calculations. Option H is Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Punnett square. Let me create the actual Punnett square for F2.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nF1 genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nCreating the Punnett square:\n\n- First row: Cc (top) and cC (bottom)\u2014wait, no, each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C) and body (B), each gene's alleles are segregating.\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n       | C | c\n-------+---+---\n    C   | CC | Cc\n-------+---+---\n    B   | CB | Bc\n-------+---+---\n    B   | BC | BB\n-------+---+---\n    B   | BC | BB\n-------+---+---\n```\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me do it properly for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nFor body (B):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB)\n2. Cc (CB + cb)\n3. cc (cb + cb)\n4. bb (cb + cb)\n\nEach genotype will have a probability based on the combination of the gametes.\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n1. CC: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n4. bb: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16, which is 1:3:9:3, implying a dihybrid cross where each gene is dominant. But in our case, the phenotypes aren't following this ratio. Instead, each phenotype is equally represented, but according to my calculations, each has a 25% chance, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 if considering each phenotype individually, but in terms of counts, it depends on the total number of offspring.\n\nWait, but in the options, the ratios add up to 16. For example, option D: 1+3+9+3=16. So, 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This implies that the phenotypes are not equally probable, but rather, the more dominant alleles lead to certain phenotypes being more common. But according to Mendelian rules, each phenotype should be 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, but the underlying genetic makeup (genotypes) may influence the observed phenotype distribution. In this case, perhaps the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf I consider only the presence of dominant alleles (i.e., phenotypic expression without counting the genotype), then:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C_ \u2192 red\n  - c_ \u2192 plain\n- For body (B):\n  - B_ \u2192 brown\n  - b_ \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_): 25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and b_): 25%\n3. Plain red (c_ and B_): 25%\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_): 25%\n\nThis still gives each phenotype a 25% chance. But in reality, the presence of dominant alleles may influence the phenotype frequency in certain cases. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the dominance is clear, the phenotypic ratios should be 1:1:1:1 if considering each phenotype individually, but when grouped into combinations, they combine multiplicatively.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the phenotypic classes as groups rather than individual genotypes. For instance, Checkered red is a group consisting of Checkered brown and plain red, while Checkered brown is a separate group. But in reality, each phenotype is distinct based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nGiven that, I'm probably misunderstanding the options. Looking back, option D states Checkered red 1, Check",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in this case, each bird is characterized by the combination of C/B and c/b.",
    "rollout": " But in this case, each bird is characterized by the combination of C/B and c/b. Let me consider the F2 generation. The F2 generation would have four possible phenotypic combinations based on the parents' cross. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Also, the user mentions showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the F2 generation's possible genotypes. As established earlier, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n2. CC Bb (homozygous for C, heterozygous for B)\n3. CC bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n4. Cc BB (heterozygous for C, homozygous for B)\n5. Cc Bb (heterozygous for both genes)\n6. Cc bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n7. cc BB (homozygous recessive for C, homozygous dominant for B)\n8. cc Bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n9. cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nBut this seems too many. Actually, since each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each possible combination. Wait, no\u2014it's better to model the inheritance properly. Each gene acts independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratios can be found by considering each gene separately and then combining them. For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- C (Red)\n- c (Plain)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- B (Brown)\n- b (Checkered)\n\nThe phenotypic combinations are the product of these, leading to four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red (only C dominant, B recessive)\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B dominant, C recessive)\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown (both recessive, c and b)\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene follows a Mendelian pattern, the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 3:1 ratio. But in our case, the F2 would have four phenotypic classes. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from CC BB x cc bb was all CcBb. So the F2 would be formed by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC BB (25%), CcBb (50%), cc bb (25%). Now, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both genes dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nSince F2 is a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we've got four phenotypic classes, perhaps we need to calculate the number of each class based on the F2 genotypes. Let's see:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25/100\n- Checkered Brown (CcBb) \u2192 50% of F2 \u2192 50/100\n- Plain Red (CcBb) \u2192 50% of F2 \u2192 50/100\n- Plain Brown (cc bb) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25/100\n\nBut wait, this doesn't align with the options given because none of the choices seem to reflect exactly this 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, the options provide different ratios like 6:2:6:2 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the question isn't asking for the phenotypic ratio across all possible phenotypes but rather the ratio among specific phenotypes, possibly grouping some together due to dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual phenotypes observed in the F2 generation without aggregating all possible combinations. Let's re-examine the options.\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which might suggest a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that's inconsistent with typical Mendelian ratios. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16, suggesting a 6:2:6:2 distribution. But I thought the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe the question is considering the phenotypes based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive, regardless of the exact counts. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps instead of looking at the entire F2, we focus on the phenotypes that express distinctly. In dihybrid crosses, the F2 often shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but sometimes phenotypes are grouped into dominant and recessive categories. Alternatively, the user might have intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio within certain categories, such as dominant vs recessive.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the dominant traits. For the bird's appearance, if both pigment and body color are dominant, it's Checkered Red; otherwise, it depends on the combination. Alternatively, perhaps the question groups phenotypes differently. Let me look back at the original question.\n\nThe original question says: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\" So, we need to list each phenotype along with their count, frequency, and ratio.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Plain Red (C_bb)\n3. Checkered Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Brown (cccc)\n\nEach of these phenotypes will occur based on the F2 genotypes. From earlier, we know the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (25%)\n- CcBb: Checkered Brown (50%)\n- CcBb: Plain Red (50%)\n- cc bb: Plain Brown (25%)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:1. However, none of the answer options directly match this. The closest option seems to be E, which has a 3:9:3:1 ratio, indicating a 3:9:3:1 distribution for each gene. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting only dominant traits, excluding recessive ones. \n\nWait, let me clarify: If we group phenotypes into those that are at least partially dominant, perhaps the dominant phenotype would include Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain Red, while Plain Brown is recessive. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 12:4 (since 3 dominant plus 1 recessive?), but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to compare the number of individuals expressing dominant versus recessive traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance, ignoring the exact counts. Let me approach this by considering the actual numbers. Suppose the F2 population consists of 100 birds. According to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, we'd have 9 parts Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, and 1 Plain Brown. But this totals 16 parts, which isn't practical. However, in reality, this is scaled to 100 birds, so:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16 * 100 \u2248 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16 * 100 \u2248 18.75%\n- Plain Red: 3/16 * 100 \u2248 18.75%\n- Plain Brown: 1/16 * 100 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the answer options closely. Looking at the options again, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, totaling 16. If we scale to 100, this would imply a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio but inverted. However, this doesn't make sense because the dominant phenotype (Checkered Red and Checkered Brown) should be more frequent than the recessive ones.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance without aggregating all possible phenotypes. For example, if a bird is Checkered Red, it's expressed as such; if it's Checkered Brown, same; if Plain Red, same; and Plain Brown is another phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be 12:4:4:0 (assuming 9+3+3+1=16, but perhaps grouped differently).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, I'll proceed by selecting the most plausible option based on standard dihybrid ratios. The correct ratio should sum to 100%, so let's choose the option that best fits a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio overall. However, since the options don't directly offer this, perhaps the question is expecting the simplified ratio of dominant to recessive, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes, but that's unclear. Given the confusion, I'll select option E, which presents a 3:9:3:1 ratio, but I'm unsure why that's presented as a phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user misinterpreted the options, and the correct answer is option G, which lists the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This could mean that only 12% are Checkered Red, 2% Checkered Brown, 2% Plain Red, and 0% Plain Brown, but this doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted only the dominant traits. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with the most logical approach, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since none of the options perfectly reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which presents a 3:9:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to ask for the ratio of dominant to recessive, which would be 12:4:4:0, but that's speculative.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option G, where the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This implies that only 12% are Checkered Red, 2% Checkered Brown, 2% Plain Red, and 0% Plain Brown, which may not align with the actual dihybrid ratios but could be a way to represent the phenotypic distribution in terms of dominance.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. But in this case, each bird is characterized by the combination of C/B and c/b. Let me consider the F2 generation. The F2 generation would have four possible phenotypic combinations based on the parents' cross. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Also, the user mentions showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the F2 generation's possible genotypes. As established earlier, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n2. CC Bb (homozygous for C, heterozygous for B)\n3. CC bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n4. Cc BB (heterozygous for C, homozygous for B)\n5. Cc Bb (heterozygous for both genes)\n6. Cc bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n7. cc BB (homozygous recessive for C, homozygous dominant for B)\n8. cc Bb (homozygous recessive for C, heterozygous for B)\n9. cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nBut this seems too many. Actually, since each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each possible combination. Wait, no\u2014it's better to model the inheritance properly. Each gene acts independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratios can be found by considering each gene separately and then combining them. For each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- C (Red)\n- c (Plain)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- B (Brown)\n- b (Checkered)\n\nThe phenotypic combinations are the product of these, leading to four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red (only C dominant, B recessive)\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B dominant, C recessive)\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown (both recessive, c and b)\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene follows a Mendelian pattern, the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a dihybrid cross where each gene has a 3:1 ratio. But in our case, the F2 would have four phenotypic classes. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from CC BB x cc bb was all CcBb. So the F2 would be formed by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC BB (25%), CcBb (50%), cc bb (25%). Now, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both genes dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nSince F2 is a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we've got four phenotypic classes, perhaps we need to calculate the number of each class based on the F2 genotypes. Let's see:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25/100\n- Checkered Brown (CcBb) \u2192 50% of F2 \u2192 50/100\n- Plain Red (CcBb) \u2192 50% of F2 \u2192 50/100\n- Plain Brown (cc bb) \u2192 25% of F2 \u2192 25/100\n\nBut wait, this doesn't align with the options given because none of the choices seem to reflect exactly this 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, the options provide different ratios like 6:2:6:2 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the question isn't asking for the phenotypic ratio across all possible phenotypes but rather the ratio among specific phenotypes, possibly grouping some together due to dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual phenotypes observed in the F2 generation without aggregating all possible combinations. Let's re-examine the options.\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which might suggest a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that's inconsistent with typical Mendelian ratios. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16, suggesting a 6:2:6:2 distribution. But I thought the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe the question is considering the phenotypes based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive, regardless of the exact counts. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps instead of looking at the entire F2, we focus on the phenotypes that express distinctly. In dihybrid crosses, the F2 often shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but sometimes phenotypes are grouped into dominant and recessive categories. Alternatively, the user might have intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio within certain categories, such as dominant vs recessive.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the dominant traits. For the bird's appearance, if both pigment and body color are dominant, it's Checkered Red; otherwise, it depends on the combination. Alternatively, perhaps the question groups phenotypes differently. Let me look back at the original question.\n\nThe original question says: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\" So, we need to list each phenotype along with their count, frequency, and ratio.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Plain Red (C_bb)\n3. Checkered Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Brown (cccc)\n\nEach of these phenotypes will occur based on the F2 genotypes. From earlier, we know the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (25%)\n- CcBb: Checkered Brown (50%)\n- CcBb: Plain Red (50%)\n- cc bb: Plain Brown (25%)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:1. However, none of the answer options directly match this. The closest option seems to be E, which has a 3:9:3:1 ratio, indicating a 3:9:3:1 distribution for each gene. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting only dominant traits, excluding recessive ones. \n\nWait, let me clarify: If we group phenotypes into those that are at least partially dominant, perhaps the dominant phenotype would include Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain Red, while Plain Brown is recessive. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 12:4 (since 3 dominant plus 1 recessive?), but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to compare the number of individuals expressing dominant versus recessive traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance, ignoring the exact counts. Let me approach this by considering the actual numbers. Suppose the F2 population consists of 100 birds. According to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, we'd have 9 parts Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, and 1 Plain Brown. But this totals 16 parts, which isn't practical. However, in reality, this is scaled to 100 birds, so:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16 * 100 \u2248 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16 * 100 \u2248 18.75%\n- Plain Red: 3/16 * 100 \u2248 18.75%\n- Plain Brown: 1/16 * 100 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the answer options closely. Looking at the options again, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, totaling 16. If we scale to 100, this would imply a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio but inverted. However, this doesn't make sense because the dominant phenotype (Checkered Red and Checkered Brown) should be more frequent than the recessive ones.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance without aggregating all possible phenotypes. For example, if a bird is Checkered Red, it's expressed as such; if it's Checkered Brown, same; if Plain Red, same; and Plain Brown is another phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be 12:4:4:0 (assuming 9+3+3+1=16, but perhaps grouped differently).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, I'll proceed by selecting the most plausible option based on standard dihybrid ratios. The correct ratio should sum to 100%, so let's choose the option that best fits a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio overall. However, since the options don't directly offer this, perhaps the question is expecting the simplified ratio of dominant to recessive, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes, but that's unclear. Given the confusion, I'll select option E, which presents a 3:9:3:1 ratio, but I'm unsure why that's presented as a phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user misinterpreted the options, and the correct answer is option G, which lists the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This could mean that only 12% are Checkered Red, 2% Checkered Brown, 2% Plain Red, and 0% Plain Brown, but this doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted only the dominant traits. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with the most logical approach, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since none of the options perfectly reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which presents a 3:9:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to ask for the ratio of dominant to recessive, which would be 12:4:4:0, but that's speculative.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option G, where the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This implies that only 12% are Checkered Red, 2% Checkered Brown, 2% Plain Red, and 0% Plain Brown, which may not align with the actual dihybrid ratios but could be a way to represent the phenotypic distribution in terms of dominance.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " Each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive, so the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but in this case, each gene is additive, so the presence of either dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So for pigment color, if C is present, the bird is red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, brown; else, checkered. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, each of these combinations depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probabilities multiply. So for pigment color, there's a 50% chance of being red or plain. For body color, same: 50% brown or checkered. Since these are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 25% for each of the four combinations. But wait, does that mean each phenotype appears 25% of the time? That doesn't seem right because some phenotypes might overlap. Wait, no\u2014if the traits are additive, then each phenotype is distinct. So in reality, each of the four combinations is equally likely, so each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match this exact distribution. Let me review the options given:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nBut according to my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 4 phenotypes \u00d7 25% = 4 phenotypes, each appearing 25% of the time. So in F2, each phenotype would appear 4 instances (assuming 16 total offspring). Looking at option D: 1+3+9+3=16. Hmm, that adds up to 16, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the actual genotypes leading to those phenotypes. Let me re-examine. The F2 generation is from the F1 cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). The F1 is CcBb. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C and/or B are dominant. Now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nBut this totals 16, which matches the F2 size. However, none of the answer choices reflect 4 each. So I must have misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps the original cross isn't F1\u00d7F1 but F1\u00d7F2, where F1 is CcBb and F2 is another F1. But the question says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the parents are homozygous (checkered red: CC BB) and (plain brown: cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2. But regardless, each phenotype would still be 25% of the population, leading to 4 each, totaling 16. But the answer choices don't include this. So perhaps the question refers to a different scenario, like considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the genotype frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation, considering the dominance hierarchy. Wait, in this case, both genes are additive, so the phenotypes would be distinct without any blending. Thus, each of the four phenotypes would have equal frequency, leading to 25% each, i.e., 4 each. But this doesn't align with the answer choices provided. Let me look again at the options:\n\nLooking at option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12. This suggests a different approach, possibly considering the actual counts based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes properly.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C: red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Each trait is determined independently, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nEach phenotype occurs with a probability of 25% (since each gene is independent and each has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive).\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, each phenotype should appear 4 times out of 16, so 25% each. Hence, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, 4 each. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking through the options provided:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Summing to 16, which fits 16 individuals. But why would the counts be 1,3,9,3? That suggests that checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding up to 16. How could this happen?\n\nAh! Perhaps the question is not asking about the phenotypic ratio but rather the genotypic ratio, and then converting that to phenotypic ratio. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the setup. Let me double-check the cross described.\n\nWait, the cross described is a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant, all B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 25% cc (all c dominant, all B recessive)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n1. CC (genotype): All C dominant \u2192 Pigment red.\n   Also, since B is dominant (as it's B), the bird is brown.\n   So phenotype: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red?\nWait, no, because B is dominant, the bird would be brown. So phenotype: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red? No, wait. Pigment color is determined by C, which is red. Brown color is determined by B, which is dominant. So the bird would be red and brown, which is called \"checkered\" or \"plain\"? Wait, no. Pigment color is red, body color is brown. So the phenotype would be \"Pigment red and brown,\" which combines to make it \"Checkered red?\" Or perhaps it's considered as \"Plain red and brown\" since the bird is both red and brown. Wait, perhaps the terminology is that when both traits are present, it's considered as \"checkered\" (plain plus brown), while when only one trait is present, it's \"plain\" or \"red.\"\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (C): Red (dominant) or Plain (recessive)\n- Body color (B): Brown (dominant) or Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (Red), and B is present (Brown), the phenotype is \"Checkered red.\"\n- If C is present (Red), and B is absent (Checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain red.\"\n- If C is absent (Plain), and B is present (Brown), the phenotype is \"Checkered brown.\"\n- If C is absent (Plain), and B is absent (Checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain brown.\"\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Both C and B are dominant. Phenotype: Checkered red.\n2. Cc (50%): Only C is dominant. Phenotype: Plain red.\n3. cc (25%): Neither C nor B is dominant. Phenotype: Plain brown.\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes and phenotypes:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 50% : 25% = 1 : 2 : 1\n\nIn terms of numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich corresponds to a 1:2:1 ratio. But this doesn't match any of the given answer choices. Let me compare the answer options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Total 18 (doesn't add up)\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, the sum of all options except G is 16. Option D sums to 1+3+9+3=16, option E also sums to 16, and option F also sums to 16. None of these options directly represent the 1:2:1 ratio I derived earlier.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, not the count divided by the total. Let me recount using the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (25%) \u2192 4 birds\n2. Plain red: Cc (50%) \u2192 8 birds\n3. Plain brown: cc (25%) \u2192 4 birds\n4. Wait, what about CcBb? Oh, no, in our breakdown above, Cc is plain red and cc is plain brown. Wait, but the F2 also includes CcBb, which would be Cc (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 Plain red, and ccBb \u2192 cc (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown. But in the previous analysis, all the Cc (50%) is Plain red, and all the cc is Plain brown. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n- Checkered brown: 0\n\nBut none of the answer options include 0 for plain brown. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio without considering the genotypes that lead to the same phenotype, thus aggregating certain counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning phenotypes. Let me try again:\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (because it's red and checkered)\n2. Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. Plain red: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n4. Plain brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the Cc (50%) is all plain red, and cc (25%) is all plain brown. The CcBb birds would have C dominant and B recessive, so they are Checkered brown. Wait, no: CcBb would have C dominant and B recessive, making them Checkered brown. But in the F2 generation, the Cc (50%) is all plain red, and the cc (25%) is all plain brown. The CcBb (which is half of the F2, 8 birds?) Wait, no, because the F2 is 16 birds: 4 CC, 8 Cc, 4 cc. But in the previous analysis, the Cc (8 birds) are all plain red, and the cc (4 birds) are all plain brown, and the CcBb (4 birds) are Checkered brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (from CC)\n- Plain red: 8 (from Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (from CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 4 (from cc)\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the answer options, option J states a ratio of 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but that's less than 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering only the presence of each trait without considering dominance, which would make each phenotype unique. In that case, the F2 would have:\n\n- 16 birds\n- All four phenotypes would occur once, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution, treating each bird as an individual entity. Let me recount based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Plain red\n- cc (25%): Plain brown\n\nSo, the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Plain red: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Checkered brown: 0 (since CcBb would have C dominant and B recessive, making them Checkered brown, which was included in the CC category?)\n\nWait, no. The CcBb would have C dominant (so red) and B recessive (so checkered), making them Checkered brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4)\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (4)\n- Plain red: Cc (8)\n- Plain brown: cc (4)\n\nAdding these up gives 4 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 20, which exceeds 16. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, no, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (when the parents are homozygous) would yield 16 birds, with the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (red, brown)\n- 50% Cc (red, checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Plain red\n3. cc: Plain brown\n\nEach of these occurs 4, 8, and 4 times respectively, adding up to 16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:8:4, or simplified to 1:2:1. Converting this into the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nNone of the answer options reflect this exactly. Let's see the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 birds. But according to our calculations, it's 4,8,4. So none match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, not the count per bird. So, if the F2 has:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4 (from CcBb)\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:1:2:1. But this still doesn't match any answer option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the presence of each trait, not considering dominance. That would make each bird either 'red' or 'non-red', and similarly 'brown' or 'non-brown'. In that case, each bird would fall into one of four categories, but in reality, dominance makes each trait additive. Without dominance, each bird would be classified based on having at least one dominant trait.\n\nUnder this assumption:\n\n- Checkered red: both traits are present \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Plain red: only pigment red \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Checkered brown: only body color brown \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Plain brown: only body color brown \u2192 Counts as 1\n\nBut this leads to each bird falling into one category, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, not matching any options.\n\nGiven that none of the answer options perfectly fit our",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive, so the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but in this case, each gene is additive, so the presence of either dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So for pigment color, if C is present, the bird is red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, brown; else, checkered. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, each of these combinations depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probabilities multiply. So for pigment color, there's a 50% chance of being red or plain. For body color, same: 50% brown or checkered. Since these are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 25% for each of the four combinations. But wait, does that mean each phenotype appears 25% of the time? That doesn't seem right because some phenotypes might overlap. Wait, no\u2014if the traits are additive, then each phenotype is distinct. So in reality, each of the four combinations is equally likely, so each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match this exact distribution. Let me review the options given:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nBut according to my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 4 phenotypes \u00d7 25% = 4 phenotypes, each appearing 25% of the time. So in F2, each phenotype would appear 4 instances (assuming 16 total offspring). Looking at option D: 1+3+9+3=16. Hmm, that adds up to 16, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the actual genotypes leading to those phenotypes. Let me re-examine. The F2 generation is from the F1 cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). The F1 is CcBb. So when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C and/or B are dominant. Now, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4\n\nBut this totals 16, which matches the F2 size. However, none of the answer choices reflect 4 each. So I must have misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps the original cross isn't F1\u00d7F1 but F1\u00d7F2, where F1 is CcBb and F2 is another F1. But the question says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the parents are homozygous (checkered red: CC BB) and (plain brown: cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2. But regardless, each phenotype would still be 25% of the population, leading to 4 each, totaling 16. But the answer choices don't include this. So perhaps the question refers to a different scenario, like considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the genotype frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation, considering the dominance hierarchy. Wait, in this case, both genes are additive, so the phenotypes would be distinct without any blending. Thus, each of the four phenotypes would have equal frequency, leading to 25% each, i.e., 4 each. But this doesn't align with the answer choices provided. Let me look again at the options:\n\nLooking at option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12. This suggests a different approach, possibly considering the actual counts based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes properly.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C: red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Each trait is determined independently, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nEach phenotype occurs with a probability of 25% (since each gene is independent and each has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive).\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, each phenotype should appear 4 times out of 16, so 25% each. Hence, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, 4 each. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking through the options provided:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Summing to 16, which fits 16 individuals. But why would the counts be 1,3,9,3? That suggests that checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding up to 16. How could this happen?\n\nAh! Perhaps the question is not asking about the phenotypic ratio but rather the genotypic ratio, and then converting that to phenotypic ratio. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the setup. Let me double-check the cross described.\n\nWait, the cross described is a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant, all B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 25% cc (all c dominant, all B recessive)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n1. CC (genotype): All C dominant \u2192 Pigment red.\n   Also, since B is dominant (as it's B), the bird is brown.\n   So phenotype: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red?\nWait, no, because B is dominant, the bird would be brown. So phenotype: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red? No, wait. Pigment color is determined by C, which is red. Brown color is determined by B, which is dominant. So the bird would be red and brown, which is called \"checkered\" or \"plain\"? Wait, no. Pigment color is red, body color is brown. So the phenotype would be \"Pigment red and brown,\" which combines to make it \"Checkered red?\" Or perhaps it's considered as \"Plain red and brown\" since the bird is both red and brown. Wait, perhaps the terminology is that when both traits are present, it's considered as \"checkered\" (plain plus brown), while when only one trait is present, it's \"plain\" or \"red.\"\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (C): Red (dominant) or Plain (recessive)\n- Body color (B): Brown (dominant) or Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (Red), and B is present (Brown), the phenotype is \"Checkered red.\"\n- If C is present (Red), and B is absent (Checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain red.\"\n- If C is absent (Plain), and B is present (Brown), the phenotype is \"Checkered brown.\"\n- If C is absent (Plain), and B is absent (Checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain brown.\"\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Both C and B are dominant. Phenotype: Checkered red.\n2. Cc (50%): Only C is dominant. Phenotype: Plain red.\n3. cc (25%): Neither C nor B is dominant. Phenotype: Plain brown.\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes and phenotypes:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 50% : 25% = 1 : 2 : 1\n\nIn terms of numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich corresponds to a 1:2:1 ratio. But this doesn't match any of the given answer choices. Let me compare the answer options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Total 18 (doesn't add up)\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, the sum of all options except G is 16. Option D sums to 1+3+9+3=16, option E also sums to 16, and option F also sums to 16. None of these options directly represent the 1:2:1 ratio I derived earlier.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, not the count divided by the total. Let me recount using the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC (25%) \u2192 4 birds\n2. Plain red: Cc (50%) \u2192 8 birds\n3. Plain brown: cc (25%) \u2192 4 birds\n4. Wait, what about CcBb? Oh, no, in our breakdown above, Cc is plain red and cc is plain brown. Wait, but the F2 also includes CcBb, which would be Cc (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 Plain red, and ccBb \u2192 cc (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown. But in the previous analysis, all the Cc (50%) is Plain red, and all the cc is Plain brown. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n- Checkered brown: 0\n\nBut none of the answer options include 0 for plain brown. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio without considering the genotypes that lead to the same phenotype, thus aggregating certain counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning phenotypes. Let me try again:\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (because it's red and checkered)\n2. Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. Plain red: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n4. Plain brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the Cc (50%) is all plain red, and cc (25%) is all plain brown. The CcBb birds would have C dominant and B recessive, so they are Checkered brown. Wait, no: CcBb would have C dominant and B recessive, making them Checkered brown. But in the F2 generation, the Cc (50%) is all plain red, and the cc (25%) is all plain brown. The CcBb (which is half of the F2, 8 birds?) Wait, no, because the F2 is 16 birds: 4 CC, 8 Cc, 4 cc. But in the previous analysis, the Cc (8 birds) are all plain red, and the cc (4 birds) are all plain brown, and the CcBb (4 birds) are Checkered brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (from CC)\n- Plain red: 8 (from Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (from CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 4 (from cc)\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the answer options, option J states a ratio of 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but that's less than 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering only the presence of each trait without considering dominance, which would make each phenotype unique. In that case, the F2 would have:\n\n- 16 birds\n- All four phenotypes would occur once, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution, treating each bird as an individual entity. Let me recount based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red\n- Cc (50%): Plain red\n- cc (25%): Plain brown\n\nSo, the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Plain red: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Checkered brown: 0 (since CcBb would have C dominant and B recessive, making them Checkered brown, which was included in the CC category?)\n\nWait, no. The CcBb would have C dominant (so red) and B recessive (so checkered), making them Checkered brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4)\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (4)\n- Plain red: Cc (8)\n- Plain brown: cc (4)\n\nAdding these up gives 4 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 20, which exceeds 16. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, no, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (when the parents are homozygous) would yield 16 birds, with the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (red, brown)\n- 50% Cc (red, checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Plain red\n3. cc: Plain brown\n\nEach of these occurs 4, 8, and 4 times respectively, adding up to 16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:8:4, or simplified to 1:2:1. Converting this into the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nNone of the answer options reflect this exactly. Let's see the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 birds. But according to our calculations, it's 4,8,4. So none match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, not the count per bird. So, if the F2 has:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4 (from CcBb)\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:1:2:1. But this still doesn't match any answer option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the presence of each trait, not considering dominance. That would make each bird either 'red' or 'non-red', and similarly 'brown' or 'non-brown'. In that case, each bird would fall into one of four categories, but in reality, dominance makes each trait additive. Without dominance, each bird would be classified based on having at least one dominant trait.\n\nUnder this assumption:\n\n- Checkered red: both traits are present \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Plain red: only pigment red \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Checkered brown: only body color brown \u2192 Counts as 1\n- Plain brown: only body color brown \u2192 Counts as 1\n\nBut this leads to each bird falling into one category, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, not matching any options.\n\nGiven that none of the answer options perfectly fit our",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.",
    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (red): 1/2 (since C is dominant over c)\n- Probability of c (plain): 1/2\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (brown): 1/2\n- Probability of b (checkered): 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but according to the options given, the phenotypic ratios don't add up to 1. Let me verify the sum: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1. That adds up. Now, looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't match our calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on whether the bird is C/C (red) and/or B/B (brown). So:\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered), then phenotype is checkered red.\n- If CC and Bb (brown), checkered brown.\n- If cc (plain) and Bb (brown), plain brown.\n- If cc and bb (checkered), plain checkered.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So:\n\n- C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n- c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo the probabilities are indeed 25% for each phenotype. But the options given do not reflect this directly. They seem to group the phenotypes differently. For example, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which adds up to 16. That doesn't align with our 4 phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are grouping phenotypes into categories without considering dominance, leading to different counts. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Total 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Total 16.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 16. Wait, I must have miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nEach phenotypic category has 4 possible outcomes, each with 25% chance, so 4 x 0.25 = 1 for each category. But the options might be aggregating these differently. For example, in option A, checkered red is 6, checkered brown 2, which sums to 8, but that contradicts the 16 total. Perhaps the options are showing multiple genotypes per phenotype instead of phenotypes overall.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the options are presenting the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, considering the actual counts from the Punnett square. Let me try creating a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParent 1 (F1) is CcBb, and Parent 2 is CcBb. Their F2 generation will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, the F2 will have four possible combinations of these gametes. Let's list them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014it's the F2 individuals who produce gametes, not the parents.)\n\nWait, no, the F2 individuals are formed by the combinations of the gametes from F1 parents. Each F2 individual gets one gamete from each parent. So the F2 will have four possible combinations of the gametes from each parent:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB\n- From Parent 2: CB\n\nSo F2 genotype: CcBb\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (and cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 same)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (and cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 same)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (all plain)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nThe F2 individuals will receive one gamete from each parent. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB (from Parent 1) \u00d7 CB (from Parent 2) \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014because each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotype is CcBb)\nWait, no, the F2 individuals will have two alleles from each parent. So for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigenment):\n  - Parent 1: C (25%), c (50%, 75%?)\nWait, no, the F2 genotypes for each gene are calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C gene:\n\nEach F2 individual inherits one allele from each parent. Since both parents are Cc (from F1), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 for C is:\n\n- 25% CC (both C from each parent)\n- 50% Cc (one C and one c)\n- 25% cc (both c)\n\nSame logic applies to the B gene. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes has a 25% chance in the F2 generation. However, looking at the options, some of them group these phenotypes together differently. For example, option D groups checkered red with plain red and vice versa, implying that checkered and plain are treated as separate categories.\n\nLet me calculate the actual numbers in the F2 generation. Each F2 individual is a combination of the gametes from both parents. Each parent contributes one allele, so there are four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- For the C gene:\n  - From Parent 1: C\n  - From Parent 2: C \u2192 CC (red)\n  - From Parent 1: C\n  - From Parent 2: c \u2192 Cc (red)\n  - From Parent 1: c\n  - From Parent 2: C \u2192 Cc (red)\n  - From Parent 1: c\n  - From Parent 2: c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes are combinations of the gametes. Each F2 individual will have two alleles from each parent. So for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C:\n- Both alleles C \u2192 CC (red)\n- One C and one c \u2192 Cc (red)\n- Both alleles c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Both alleles B \u2192 BB (brown)\n- One B and one b \u2192 Bb (brown)\n- Both alleles b \u2192 bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present (CC or Cc) but B is absent (bb), the bird is plain checkered.\n- If C is absent (cc) but B is present (BB or Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If C and B are both absent (cc and bb), the bird is plain brown.\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation can be calculated based on the Punnett square. Since each parent is CcBb, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but the actual counts for each phenotype will depend on the probabilities.\n\nHowever, since each gene is independent, the probabilities are:\n\n- P(checkered red) = P(C present) * P(B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n- Similarly, P(plain red) = P(C present) * P(B recessive) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n- P(checkered brown) = P(C recessive) * P(B present) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n- P(plain brown) = P(C recessive) * P(B recessive) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1 = 9 parts out of 16, which makes sense because the F2 generation is 16 individuals.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them represent 4 phenotypes each at 25%. Instead, some options group them into categories where some phenotypes combine. For instance, option D groups checkered red and plain red together, implying that they're considered as one category. But in reality, they're distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are simplifying the process by treating the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, regardless of the other. Let me recalculate the actual counts:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each phenotype will occur based on the number of each genotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/9 of the population\n- Plain red (C_bb): 2/9\n- Checkered brown (cc_B_): 2/9\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): 1/9\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts out of 16.\n\nTherefore, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This seems incorrect because our calculations show 4, 2, 2, 1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the options are considering the number of each type of bird, including both males and females, but the question doesn't specify gender differences. However, even if they did, the phenotypic ratios remain the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Maybe it's asking about the F2 generation in terms of genotypes rather than phenotypes. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question asks: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So it's asking about phenotypes. None of the options seem to fit my previous calculations. Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nNone of these options add up to 16 unless I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the options are grouped differently, such as combining phenotypes into broader categories. For example, checkered and plain could be considered one category, and similarly for brown and plain. Let me see:\n\nIf we group checkered (red) and plain as one category, and brown and plain as another, the counts become:\n\n- Group 1: checkered-red and plain-red \u2192 6 + 2 = 8\n- Group 2: checkered-brown and plain-brown \u2192 2 + 1 = 3\n\nBut the options don't present this grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, not considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. So:\n\n- If either C or B is dominant, the bird is either checkered (B) or plain (b)\n- Similarly, if either C or B is dominant, the bird is either red (C) or brown (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nEach with probabilities of 4/9, 2/9, 2/9, and 1/9 respectively.\n\nNow, translating these to counts in the F2 generation (assuming 16 birds):\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options again, none of them exactly match this except perhaps option D, which lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the options are presented incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to larger numbers. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 8\n- Checkered brown:4\n- Plain red:0\n- Plain brown:4\n\nWhich would correspond to option B. But that doesn't align with the probabilities I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or one for color (B), they express that trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain red\n- Checkered (b) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Checkered (b) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are as before. Now, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing those gives 1+3+9+3=16, which matches, but the breakdown is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are intended to treat the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, thus combining all cases where a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment or color into a single category. But that would lead to:\n\n- Pigment red or color brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red or color checkered \u2192 plain red\n- Color checkered or pigment red \u2192 checkered brown\n- Color checkered and pigment checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut then, the counts would still be 4,2,2,1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the way it's phrased is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype in terms of all possible birds, not considering dominance. For example, if the question is about the number of each phenotype irrespective of dominance, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 8 (since 4/16 * 4=16? No, wait, 4/16=1/4, so 16*(4/16)=4, but if considering all, it's 4 out of 16. Maybe the options are scaling it up.)\n\nThis is getting too confusing. I think the most accurate count based on Mendelian inheritance is:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none perfectly match this, but option D has 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. However, the distribution is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options are intended to be scaled up by a factor, like doubling everything. If the F2 generation is 32 birds, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 8\n- Checkered brown:4\n- Plain red:0\n- Plain brown:4\n\nWhich corresponds to option B. But the question doesn't mention scaling up, so I shouldn't assume that.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me redo the probabilities. In the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting, so the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: P(c) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) =",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (red): 1/2 (since C is dominant over c)\n- Probability of c (plain): 1/2\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (brown): 1/2\n- Probability of b (checkered): 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but according to the options given, the phenotypic ratios don't add up to 1. Let me verify the sum: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1. That adds up. Now, looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't match our calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on whether the bird is C/C (red) and/or B/B (brown). So:\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered), then phenotype is checkered red.\n- If CC and Bb (brown), checkered brown.\n- If cc (plain) and Bb (brown), plain brown.\n- If cc and bb (checkered), plain checkered.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So:\n\n- C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n- c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 checkered brown\n- c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo the probabilities are indeed 25% for each phenotype. But the options given do not reflect this directly. They seem to group the phenotypes differently. For example, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which adds up to 16. That doesn't align with our 4 phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are grouping phenotypes into categories without considering dominance, leading to different counts. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Total 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Total 16.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 16. Wait, I must have miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nEach phenotypic category has 4 possible outcomes, each with 25% chance, so 4 x 0.25 = 1 for each category. But the options might be aggregating these differently. For example, in option A, checkered red is 6, checkered brown 2, which sums to 8, but that contradicts the 16 total. Perhaps the options are showing multiple genotypes per phenotype instead of phenotypes overall.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the options are presenting the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, considering the actual counts from the Punnett square. Let me try creating a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParent 1 (F1) is CcBb, and Parent 2 is CcBb. Their F2 generation will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, the F2 will have four possible combinations of these gametes. Let's list them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014it's the F2 individuals who produce gametes, not the parents.)\n\nWait, no, the F2 individuals are formed by the combinations of the gametes from F1 parents. Each F2 individual gets one gamete from each parent. So the F2 will have four possible combinations of the gametes from each parent:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB\n- From Parent 2: CB\n\nSo F2 genotype: CcBb\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (and cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 same)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (and cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 same)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (all plain)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nThe F2 individuals will receive one gamete from each parent. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB (from Parent 1) \u00d7 CB (from Parent 2) \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014because each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotype is CcBb)\nWait, no, the F2 individuals will have two alleles from each parent. So for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigenment):\n  - Parent 1: C (25%), c (50%, 75%?)\nWait, no, the F2 genotypes for each gene are calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C gene:\n\nEach F2 individual inherits one allele from each parent. Since both parents are Cc (from F1), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 for C is:\n\n- 25% CC (both C from each parent)\n- 50% Cc (one C and one c)\n- 25% cc (both c)\n\nSame logic applies to the B gene. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes has a 25% chance in the F2 generation. However, looking at the options, some of them group these phenotypes together differently. For example, option D groups checkered red with plain red and vice versa, implying that checkered and plain are treated as separate categories.\n\nLet me calculate the actual numbers in the F2 generation. Each F2 individual is a combination of the gametes from both parents. Each parent contributes one allele, so there are four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- For the C gene:\n  - From Parent 1: C\n  - From Parent 2: C \u2192 CC (red)\n  - From Parent 1: C\n  - From Parent 2: c \u2192 Cc (red)\n  - From Parent 1: c\n  - From Parent 2: C \u2192 Cc (red)\n  - From Parent 1: c\n  - From Parent 2: c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 genotypes are combinations of the gametes. Each F2 individual will have two alleles from each parent. So for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C:\n- Both alleles C \u2192 CC (red)\n- One C and one c \u2192 Cc (red)\n- Both alleles c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Both alleles B \u2192 BB (brown)\n- One B and one b \u2192 Bb (brown)\n- Both alleles b \u2192 bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc) and B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present (CC or Cc) but B is absent (bb), the bird is plain checkered.\n- If C is absent (cc) but B is present (BB or Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If C and B are both absent (cc and bb), the bird is plain brown.\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation can be calculated based on the Punnett square. Since each parent is CcBb, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, but the actual counts for each phenotype will depend on the probabilities.\n\nHowever, since each gene is independent, the probabilities are:\n\n- P(checkered red) = P(C present) * P(B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n- Similarly, P(plain red) = P(C present) * P(B recessive) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n- P(checkered brown) = P(C recessive) * P(B present) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n- P(plain brown) = P(C recessive) * P(B recessive) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1 = 9 parts out of 16, which makes sense because the F2 generation is 16 individuals.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them represent 4 phenotypes each at 25%. Instead, some options group them into categories where some phenotypes combine. For instance, option D groups checkered red and plain red together, implying that they're considered as one category. But in reality, they're distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are simplifying the process by treating the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, regardless of the other. Let me recalculate the actual counts:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each phenotype will occur based on the number of each genotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/9 of the population\n- Plain red (C_bb): 2/9\n- Checkered brown (cc_B_): 2/9\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): 1/9\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts out of 16.\n\nTherefore, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This seems incorrect because our calculations show 4, 2, 2, 1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the options are considering the number of each type of bird, including both males and females, but the question doesn't specify gender differences. However, even if they did, the phenotypic ratios remain the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Maybe it's asking about the F2 generation in terms of genotypes rather than phenotypes. Let me reread the question.\n\nThe question asks: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So it's asking about phenotypes. None of the options seem to fit my previous calculations. Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nNone of these options add up to 16 unless I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the options are grouped differently, such as combining phenotypes into broader categories. For example, checkered and plain could be considered one category, and similarly for brown and plain. Let me see:\n\nIf we group checkered (red) and plain as one category, and brown and plain as another, the counts become:\n\n- Group 1: checkered-red and plain-red \u2192 6 + 2 = 8\n- Group 2: checkered-brown and plain-brown \u2192 2 + 1 = 3\n\nBut the options don't present this grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, not considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait. So:\n\n- If either C or B is dominant, the bird is either checkered (B) or plain (b)\n- Similarly, if either C or B is dominant, the bird is either red (C) or brown (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nEach with probabilities of 4/9, 2/9, 2/9, and 1/9 respectively.\n\nNow, translating these to counts in the F2 generation (assuming 16 birds):\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options again, none of them exactly match this except perhaps option D, which lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the options are presented incorrectly, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to larger numbers. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 8\n- Checkered brown:4\n- Plain red:0\n- Plain brown:4\n\nWhich would correspond to option B. But that doesn't align with the probabilities I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or one for color (B), they express that trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain red\n- Checkered (b) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Checkered (b) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are as before. Now, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing those gives 1+3+9+3=16, which matches, but the breakdown is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are intended to treat the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype, thus combining all cases where a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment or color into a single category. But that would lead to:\n\n- Pigment red or color brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red or color checkered \u2192 plain red\n- Color checkered or pigment red \u2192 checkered brown\n- Color checkered and pigment checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut then, the counts would still be 4,2,2,1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the way it's phrased is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype in terms of all possible birds, not considering dominance. For example, if the question is about the number of each phenotype irrespective of dominance, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 8 (since 4/16 * 4=16? No, wait, 4/16=1/4, so 16*(4/16)=4, but if considering all, it's 4 out of 16. Maybe the options are scaling it up.)\n\nThis is getting too confusing. I think the most accurate count based on Mendelian inheritance is:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none perfectly match this, but option D has 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. However, the distribution is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the options are intended to be scaled up by a factor, like doubling everything. If the F2 generation is 32 birds, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 8\n- Checkered brown:4\n- Plain red:0\n- Plain brown:4\n\nWhich corresponds to option B. But the question doesn't mention scaling up, so I shouldn't assume that.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me redo the probabilities. In the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting, so the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: P(c) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) =",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

    "rollout": " Since the genes are independent and assuming Mendelian inheritance, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them. For the C locus: \n- Probability of having C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since each bird has two alleles, and the presence of at least one C results in red pigment)\n- Probability of having c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of having b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four combinations.

Let me review the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. My ratio is 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. So perhaps option G is closer, but it's 12 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 0 brown. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit. Option E has 3 red, 9 brown, which seems inverted. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters are confusing. Let me clarify: \n\nIn the options, \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype, not the genotype. So checkered red would mean the bird is plain (c) in the C locus and brown (B) in the B locus. Similarly, checkered brown would be plain in C and checkered in B. Plain red is c in C and red in B, and plain brown is plain in C and brown in B. Wait, no\u2014the C locus being plain (c) corresponds to checkered phenotype, while red is when C is present. Similarly, B locus being brown (B) corresponds to brown phenotype, while checkered is when b is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n- Plain red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Plain brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes for each gene. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our ratio but reversed. So perhaps the options are presented incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting the letters. Alternatively, perhaps the letters correspond differently. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters represent different things. Let me see:\n\nThe options list phenotypic ratios like checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, etc. If checkered red corresponds to c (C recessive) and B (B dominant) \u2192 plain C and brown B. Similarly, checkered brown is c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 plain C and checkered B. Plain red is c (C recessive) and B (B dominant) \u2192 same as checkered red. Wait, that can't be right because checkered red and plain red would both have c (C recessive), but different B alleles. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it's c (C recessive) regardless of B. So checkered red would be c and B dominant, which is also the same as plain red, except that plain red might imply both C and B dominant. Wait, now I'm confused.\n\nLet me clarify: The term \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype, which happens when the bird has the recessive allele for the B gene (b) and dominant for the C gene (C). So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n- Plain red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant) \u2192 same as checkered red\n- Plain brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 same as checkered brown\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because then checkered red and plain red would both be c (C recessive), but different B alleles. How can a bird have c (C recessive) and B (B dominant) versus c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)? They would have different phenotypes. Because if C is dominant, the bird would express the red pigment regardless of B. So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B dominant \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 plain body, brown pigment\n- Plain red: same as checkered red \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n- Plain brown: same as checkered brown \u2192 brown pigment, plain body\n\nWait, that makes sense. So in F2, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B dominant \u2192 9 cases\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: same as checkered red \u2192 9 cases\n- Plain brown: same as checkered brown \u2192 3 cases\n\nBut that's the reverse of what I thought earlier. So the ratio would be 9:3:9:3, but grouped into checkered-red and plain-red, and checkered-brown and plain-brown. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That fits perfectly. So the answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since the genes are independent and assuming Mendelian inheritance, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them. For the C locus: \n- Probability of having C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since each bird has two alleles, and the presence of at least one C results in red pigment)\n- Probability of having c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of having b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four combinations. In terms of actual counts, if we assume a large number of birds, say 16 birds, we'd expect 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. \n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options:\n\nOptions A to H are various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. My ratio is 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. So perhaps option G is closer, but it's 12 red, 2 brown, 2 red, 0 brown. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit. Option E has 3 red, 9 brown, which seems inverted. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters are confusing. Let me clarify: \n\nIn the options, \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype, not the genotype. So checkered red would mean the bird is plain (c) in the C locus and brown (B) in the B locus. Similarly, checkered brown would be plain in C and checkered in B. Plain red is c in C and red in B, and plain brown is plain in C and brown in B. Wait, no\u2014the C locus being plain (c) corresponds to checkered phenotype, while red is when C is present. Similarly, B locus being brown (B) corresponds to brown phenotype, while checkered is when b is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n- Plain red: c (C recessive) and B (B dominant)\n- Plain brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes for each gene. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our ratio but reversed.

How can a bird have c (C recessive) and B (B dominant) versus c (C recessive) and b (B recessive)? They would have different phenotypes.

So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B dominant \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 plain body, brown pigment\n- Plain red: same as checkered red \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n- Plain brown: same as checkered brown \u2192 brown pigment, plain body\n\nWait, that makes sense. So in F2, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: c (C recessive) and B dominant \u2192 9 cases\n- Checkered brown: c (C recessive) and b (B recessive) \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: same as checkered red \u2192 9 cases\n- Plain brown: same as checkered brown \u2192 3 cases\n\nBut that's the reverse of what I thought earlier. So the ratio would be 9:3:9:3, but grouped into checkered-red and plain-red, and checkered-brown and plain-brown.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the actual phenotypic ratios are often expressed as 9:3:3:1, where each term represents the combination of both traits.

The probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, pigment red (C) and checkered (b) occurs when C is dominant and b is recessive.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's consider each gene separately.\n\nFor gene C:\n- C (dominant): red\n- c (recessive): plain\n\nProportion: 3/4 C (since CC and Cc are 3/4 of the population) and 1/4 c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- B (dominant): brown\n- b (recessive): checkered\n\nProportion: 3/4 B (brown) and 1/4 b (checkered).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for having pigment red and brown, 3/4*1/4=3/16 for pigment red and checkered, 1/4*3/4=3/16 for plain and brown, and 1/4*1/4=1/16 for plain and checkered. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the actual phenotypic ratios are often expressed as 9:3:3:1, where each term represents the combination of both traits. However, in this case, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio is divided into four categories based on the combination of both traits. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C b)\n3. Plain and brown (c B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c b)\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype depends on the dominance of the alleles. Since both genes are acting independently, each phenotype's occurrence is the product of the individual probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example, pigment red (C) and brown (B) occur when both C and B are dominant. The probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, pigment red (C) and checkered (b) occurs when C is dominant and b is recessive. That's (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPlain (c) and brown (B) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPlain (c) and checkered (b) is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options given, none directly match 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided (A to H) refer to specific ratios among the four phenotypes. Let me look at them:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Total 16 parts, but our calculation suggests 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nBut let's see what each option represents:\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16.\n\nIf the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, then the first category (pigment red and brown) is 9 units, plain red and brown is 3, etc. But according to the options, Option A seems to group them differently. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 6+6+2+2=16\n\nB. 8,4,4,0 \u2192 8+4+4+0=16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as C\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as D\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as C\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nWait, but my earlier analysis gave a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Looking at the options, Option C says 9,3,3,1, which matches exactly. Similarly, Option G also says 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but that doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. So likely, the answer intended is Option C, which states 9,3,3,1. However, looking closely, the options don't list all four, but perhaps the grouping is different. Wait, no, each option groups the four phenotypes into two categories each, like \"checkered red\" and \"checkered brown\", etc. So for example, Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct answer would be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is higher than the recessive.",
    "rollout": " For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is higher than the recessive. So for gene C: probability of C is 75% (since C/C and C/c are 75%), and c is 25%. For gene B: probability of B is 75%, b is 25%. Assuming independence, the combined probability for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles is 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25% for both dominant, 0.75*0.25=18.75% for C dominant and b recessive, and similarly for c dominant and B recessive, and 0.25*0.25=6.25% for both recessive. Adding up all combinations: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 56.25% for any phenotype. Instead, looking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nBut according to my calculation, none of the phenotypes are zero except plain brown, which would be 6.25% of the population, but that's not among the options. This suggests that either the question assumes that the recessive alleles are expressed fully, or perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. Wait, but the question states that checkered is c and plain is c, and brown is B and plain is b. So the phenotype depends on whether the bird has the dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color, presence of C makes it red, c makes it plain. For body color, presence of B makes it brown, b makes it checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are: 1. Both C and B dominant (red and brown), 2. C dominant, B recessive (red and checkered), 3. c dominant, B dominant (plain and brown), 4. c dominant, B recessive (plain and checkered).\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment:\n- C: 75%\n- c: 25%\n\nFor Body:\n- B: 75%\n- b: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the probabilities combine as 75% * 75% = 56.25% for both dominant,\n75% * 25% = 18.75% for C dominant and b recessive,\n25% * 75% = 18.75% for c dominant and B dominant,\nand 25% * 25% = 6.25% for both recessive.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be approximately:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options provided, none directly match this exactly, but option J mentions checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems off because the percentages suggest 56 vs 18 vs 18 vs 6, which doesn't align with the options. Option G is different: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, the 0 for plain brown isn't matching our calculations. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might be the total population scaled by some factor. Maybe the options assume a certain number of individuals, like 16 in total, leading to proportions. If there are 16 birds, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25% of 16 \u2248 9\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% of 16 \u2248 3\n- Plain red: 18.75% of 16 \u2248 3\n- Plain brown: 6.25% of 16 \u2248 1\n\nWhich matches option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But wait, that sums to 12, not 16. Alternatively, perhaps the options scale differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider only the presence of the alleles without considering dominance thresholds, treating each bird as having a 50% chance of expressing each trait. But that's not standard genetics. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the phenotype based purely on the presence of at least one dominant allele, regardless of dominance strength. In that case, each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. So the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment: presence of C \u2192 red\n- Body: presence of B \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present (red and brown)\n2. C present, B absent (red and checkered)\n3. C absent, B present (plain and brown)\n4. Both absent (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities would be:\n\nFor Pigment:\n- C: 75% (presence)\n- c: 25% (absence)\n\nFor Body:\n- B: 75% (presence)\n- b: 25% (absence)\n\nTotal phenotypic ratios would still follow 75% * 75% = 56.25% for red and brown, 75% * 25% = 18.75% for red and checkered, same for plain and brown, and 25% * 25% = 6.25% for plain and checkered. Thus, the phenotypic ratios remain the same as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratios, but option J seems to fit if we consider scaling to a population size where each phenotype is represented accordingly. However, another approach could be to calculate the exact number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's try that.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation consists of 9 squares arranged as a 3x3 grid. The number of each phenotype depends on the number of each gamete type. From earlier, we know that F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but each parent contributes one allele, so the actual gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 should have four possible combinations of the two genes: CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). So the F2 genotypes would be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Now, let's see how many of each phenotype these translate into.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\n\nIf we assume a population of, say, 16 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 2: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Phenotype 3: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 4: 8 (50% of 16)\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 red, 2 brown, 6 plain, 2 checkered \u2192 sum to 16. Doesn't match.\nOption B: 8 red, 4 brown, 0 plain, 4 checkered \u2192 sum to 16. Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered \u2192 sum to 16.\nThis fits because 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the phenotypic ratios should be around 56-18-18-6. So why does option C have 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, not the percentage. If each bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, then in a sample of 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): 4 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): 8 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain & Brown): 4 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain & Checkered): 8 birds\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Option C has 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered, which adds up to 16. That would imply that in a sample of 16, 9 are red, 3 are brown, etc. But according to standard genetics, the expected phenotypic ratio shouldn't be skewed like that. Perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that the dominant alleles are always expressed, thus ignoring dominance strength. So, even though in reality, the dominance threshold matters, the question may treat each bird as having a 50% chance of each trait being present, regardless of dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of dominant alleles rather than phenotypic expressions. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for body (B) would be considered \"dominant\" and hence expressed as red and brown. Similarly, others would be expressed as recessive. But this interpretation would lead to the same ratios as before: 56% red and brown, 18% red checkered, etc. Still, the numbers wouldn't match exactly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question uses a simplified model where each gene's effect is independent, and each bird has a 50% chance of expressing each trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nBut scaled to a larger population, say 16 birds, it becomes 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. Which matches option C. Therefore, option C would be the answer if we consider the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to a large enough population.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the F2 generation includes 25% of each phenotype, then in a population of 16:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4\n- Phenotype 2: 8\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 8\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option C has 9, 3, 3, 1, which sums to 16. This implies that in a sample of 16, 9 are red, 3 are brown, etc. This could happen if the phenotypes were treated as such: perhaps only those with at least one dominant allele in both genes are counted, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats each bird as having a 50% chance of each trait, leading to the observed numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypes in terms of the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of dominance, so each bird has a 50% chance of each trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation, each phenotype would occur with a frequency of (1/2)^2 = 25% for each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles. However, since the question provides multiple-choice answers, and option C matches the count if we consider the F2 generation as 9, 3, 3, 1, which would require a population size where each phenotype is represented based on their genetic probabilities.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion regarding dominance, option C seems to be the most plausible answer based on the phrasing of the question and the way the options are structured.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is higher than the recessive. So for gene C: probability of C is 75% (since C/C and C/c are 75%), and c is 25%. For gene B: probability of B is 75%, b is 25%. Assuming independence, the combined probability for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles is 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25% for both dominant, 0.75*0.25=18.75% for C dominant and b recessive, and similarly for c dominant and B recessive, and 0.25*0.25=6.25% for both recessive. Adding up all combinations: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include 56.25% for any phenotype. Instead, looking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nBut according to my calculation, none of the phenotypes are zero except plain brown, which would be 6.25% of the population, but that's not among the options. This suggests that either the question assumes that the recessive alleles are expressed fully, or perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. Wait, but the question states that checkered is c and plain is c, and brown is B and plain is b. So the phenotype depends on whether the bird has the dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color, presence of C makes it red, c makes it plain. For body color, presence of B makes it brown, b makes it checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are: 1. Both C and B dominant (red and brown), 2. C dominant, B recessive (red and checkered), 3. c dominant, B dominant (plain and brown), 4. c dominant, B recessive (plain and checkered).\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment:\n- C: 75%\n- c: 25%\n\nFor Body:\n- B: 75%\n- b: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the probabilities combine as 75% * 75% = 56.25% for both dominant,\n75% * 25% = 18.75% for C dominant and b recessive,\n25% * 75% = 18.75% for c dominant and B dominant,\nand 25% * 25% = 6.25% for both recessive.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be approximately:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options provided, none directly match this exactly, but option J mentions checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems off because the percentages suggest 56 vs 18 vs 18 vs 6, which doesn't align with the options. Option G is different: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, the 0 for plain brown isn't matching our calculations. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might be the total population scaled by some factor. Maybe the options assume a certain number of individuals, like 16 in total, leading to proportions. If there are 16 birds, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25% of 16 \u2248 9\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% of 16 \u2248 3\n- Plain red: 18.75% of 16 \u2248 3\n- Plain brown: 6.25% of 16 \u2248 1\n\nWhich matches option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But wait, that sums to 12, not 16. Alternatively, perhaps the options scale differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider only the presence of the alleles without considering dominance thresholds, treating each bird as having a 50% chance of expressing each trait. But that's not standard genetics. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the phenotype based purely on the presence of at least one dominant allele, regardless of dominance strength. In that case, each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. So the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment: presence of C \u2192 red\n- Body: presence of B \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B present (red and brown)\n2. C present, B absent (red and checkered)\n3. C absent, B present (plain and brown)\n4. Both absent (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities would be:\n\nFor Pigment:\n- C: 75% (presence)\n- c: 25% (absence)\n\nFor Body:\n- B: 75% (presence)\n- b: 25% (absence)\n\nTotal phenotypic ratios would still follow 75% * 75% = 56.25% for red and brown, 75% * 25% = 18.75% for red and checkered, same for plain and brown, and 25% * 25% = 6.25% for plain and checkered. Thus, the phenotypic ratios remain the same as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratios, but option J seems to fit if we consider scaling to a population size where each phenotype is represented accordingly. However, another approach could be to calculate the exact number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's try that.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation consists of 9 squares arranged as a 3x3 grid. The number of each phenotype depends on the number of each gamete type. From earlier, we know that F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but each parent contributes one allele, so the actual gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 should have four possible combinations of the two genes: CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). So the F2 genotypes would be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Now, let's see how many of each phenotype these translate into.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 present in 25% of cases.\n\nIf we assume a population of, say, 16 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 2: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Phenotype 3: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 4: 8 (50% of 16)\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 red, 2 brown, 6 plain, 2 checkered \u2192 sum to 16. Doesn't match.\nOption B: 8 red, 4 brown, 0 plain, 4 checkered \u2192 sum to 16. Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered \u2192 sum to 16.\nThis fits because 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the phenotypic ratios should be around 56-18-18-6. So why does option C have 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, not the percentage. If each bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, then in a sample of 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): 4 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): 8 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain & Brown): 4 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain & Checkered): 8 birds\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Option C has 9 red, 3 brown, 3 plain, 1 checkered, which adds up to 16. That would imply that in a sample of 16, 9 are red, 3 are brown, etc. But according to standard genetics, the expected phenotypic ratio shouldn't be skewed like that. Perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that the dominant alleles are always expressed, thus ignoring dominance strength. So, even though in reality, the dominance threshold matters, the question may treat each bird as having a 50% chance of each trait being present, regardless of dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of dominant alleles rather than phenotypic expressions. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for body (B) would be considered \"dominant\" and hence expressed as red and brown. Similarly, others would be expressed as recessive. But this interpretation would lead to the same ratios as before: 56% red and brown, 18% red checkered, etc. Still, the numbers wouldn't match exactly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question uses a simplified model where each gene's effect is independent, and each bird has a 50% chance of expressing each trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nBut scaled to a larger population, say 16 birds, it becomes 9, 3, 3, 1 respectively. Which matches option C. Therefore, option C would be the answer if we consider the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to a large enough population.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the F2 generation includes 25% of each phenotype, then in a population of 16:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4\n- Phenotype 2: 8\n- Phenotype 3: 4\n- Phenotype 4: 8\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option C has 9, 3, 3, 1, which sums to 16. This implies that in a sample of 16, 9 are red, 3 are brown, etc. This could happen if the phenotypes were treated as such: perhaps only those with at least one dominant allele in both genes are counted, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats each bird as having a 50% chance of each trait, leading to the observed numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypes in terms of the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of dominance, so each bird has a 50% chance of each trait. Therefore, in the F2 generation, each phenotype would occur with a frequency of (1/2)^2 = 25% for each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles. However, since the question provides multiple-choice answers, and option C matches the count if we consider the F2 generation as 9, 3, 3, 1, which would require a population size where each phenotype is represented based on their genetic probabilities.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion regarding dominance, option C seems to be the most plausible answer based on the phrasing of the question and the way the options are structured.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is (probability of pigment dominant) \u00d7 (probability of color dominant).",
    "rollout": " Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is (probability of pigment dominant) \u00d7 (probability of color dominant). For example:\n\n- Pigment dominant (C) and color dominant (B): (2/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered red\nWait, no. Wait, the probability of having pigment dominant (C) is 2/3, and color dominant (B) is also 2/3. So the chance of both being dominant is (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9. Similarly, Pigment dominant (C) and color recessive (b): (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9. Pigment recessive (c) and color dominant (B): (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9. Pigment recessive (c) and color recessive (b): (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. Adding these up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts, so the ratios are 4:2:2:1. That would correspond to checkered red (4/9), checkered brown (2/9), plain red (2/9), plain brown (1/9). Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options given. Hmm. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the phenotypes are described is different. Let me consider that checkered refers to the c allele, and plain refers to the c recessive. So checkered could mean the presence of the c allele (since c is recessive). So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), then it's red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), then it's brown. Else, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that contradicts the previous understanding. Because the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Brown color is control by dominant B\n- Checkered color by recessive allele b\n\nSo, for pigment color, presence of C makes it red; absence makes it plain. For color, presence of B makes it brown; absence makes it checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are present: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment present, color absent: red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n- Pigment absent, color present: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- Both absent: plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 as before, corresponding to the squares of 2/3 and 1/3. So the options given don't include this exact ratio, but looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this, except option G: 12:2:2:2. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. To determine the counts, we can use the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F1 was CcBb, but according to the initial setup, the parents were CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb? Wait, no\u2014it's actually that F1 produces two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cC (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. The possible phenotypes are combinations of the C and B alleles.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. C dominant (C) and B dominant (B): red and brown \u2192 checkered red (prob: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9)\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown (2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9)\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): plain and brown \u2192 plain red (1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9)\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b): plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown (1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9)\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,8,4\n\nC. 9,3,9,3\n\nD. 1,3,1,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,2\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these exactly matches 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.5, but since we have to express whole numbers, the closest approximation isn't among the options. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way to compute the F2 phenotypic ratio is to consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Since both genes are acting independently, the possible phenotypic classes are combinations of their dominant and recessive states. Each gene has two possible states, leading to four phenotypic categories. The phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene's state.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- For the C locus: presence (red) is 2/3, absence (plain) is 1/3\n- For the B locus: presence (brown) is 2/3, absence (checkered) is 1/3\n\nEach phenotype is a combination of the C and B states. Therefore:\n\n1. C+ and B+: red and brown \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and B -: red and checkered \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n3. C- and B+: plain and brown \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n4. C- and B -: plain and checkered \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is 4/9 : 2/9 : 2/9 : 1/9.\n\nNow, converting this into the total number of birds, say 18 (the denominator 9), each class would be 8,4,4,2 respectively? Wait, no\u2014if the total is 9 parts, then 4 parts correspond to 8, 2 parts correspond to 4, another 2 parts to 4, and 1 part to 2. But that adds up to 18. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which would sum to 16, but our calculation suggests 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. In the options, the numbers are listed as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So for 18 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 of 18 = 8\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 of 18 = 4\n- Plain red: 2/9 of 18 = 4\n- Plain brown: 1/9 of 18 = 2\n\nWhich totals to 18 birds. This matches option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which translates to 8:4:4:2. So option F seems to represent 4:4:4:4, which might be a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect. Let me reconsider the parent genotypes. The problem states:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red bird)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown bird)\n\nWait, does \"checkered\" refer to the c allele, making the bird look checkered? So in terms of phenotype, the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene results in the respective color. Wait, but the problem defines:\n\n- Checkered is controlled by the recessive allele (b)\n- Plain is controlled by the dominant (c)\n- Pigment color (C) is dominant (red)\n- Brown (B) is dominant\n\nSo, for pigment color:\n\n- If C is present (any dominant allele), it's red\n- If c is present, it's plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- If B is present, it's brown\n- If b is present, it's checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown \u2192 C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n2. Red and Checkered \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 c present, B present \u2192 plain red\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 c present, B absent \u2192 plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, as before. So if the total number of birds is 9, the counts would be 4,2,2,1. But none of the options match this exactly.\n\nHowever, looking at option F, it says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That would imply a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). When crossed, the F1 should be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- For pigment: presence (C) \u2192 red; absence (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color: presence (B) \u2192 brown; absence (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C+ and B+ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and b- \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c+ and B+ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c+ and b- \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C+ (2/3) and B+ (2/3): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n- C+ (2/3) and b- (1/3): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n- c+ (1/3) and B+ (2/3): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n- c+ (1/3) and b- (1/3): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nTotal birds: 9\n\nCounts:\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options exactly. Looking back at the options, option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which doesn't align with our calculations. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching.\n\nOption E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption F is checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This would require the ratio 1:1:1:1, which is not what we have here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parents. Let me confirm: The problem states that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive, and the plain bird is homozygous dominant. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). So the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. The F2 would then be:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 phenotypes:\n\n1. C+ and B+ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and b- \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c+ and B+ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c+ and b- \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nCalculating the expected counts for 9 birds:\n\n- C+ (2/3) * B+ (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n- C+ (2/3) * b- (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n- c+ (1/3) * B+ (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n- c+ (1/3) * b- (1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo in a group of 9 birds, we'd expect approximately 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. This doesn't match any of the options provided, indicating either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the F2 generation is the same as the F1 generation, which is CcBb, and thus the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. In that case, checking the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would suggest a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a 3:1 ratio in a monohybrid cross. However, this scenario doesn't fit our current problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and CC bb. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). Thus, parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, and the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which can be represented as 2:1:1:0.5 when normalized to 9 birds. However, none of the options match this. The closest option is F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, but this implies a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-express it as fractions:\n\nCheckered red: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 4\nCheckered brown: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 2\nPlain red: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 2\nPlain brown: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 1\n\nIf we round to the nearest integer, it becomes 4:2:2:1, which doesn't match any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I must have made an error elsewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the initial F1: CC BB and cc bb produce CcBb. Then, F2 would be:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is (probability of pigment dominant) \u00d7 (probability of color dominant). For example:\n\n- Pigment dominant (C) and color dominant (B): (2/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 Checkered red\nWait, no. Wait, the probability of having pigment dominant (C) is 2/3, and color dominant (B) is also 2/3. So the chance of both being dominant is (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9. Similarly, Pigment dominant (C) and color recessive (b): (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9. Pigment recessive (c) and color dominant (B): (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9. Pigment recessive (c) and color recessive (b): (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. Adding these up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts, so the ratios are 4:2:2:1. That would correspond to checkered red (4/9), checkered brown (2/9), plain red (2/9), plain brown (1/9). Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options given. Hmm. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the phenotypes are described is different. Let me consider that checkered refers to the c allele, and plain refers to the c recessive. So checkered could mean the presence of the c allele (since c is recessive). So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), then it's red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), then it's brown. Else, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that contradicts the previous understanding. Because the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Brown color is control by dominant B\n- Checkered color by recessive allele b\n\nSo, for pigment color, presence of C makes it red; absence makes it plain. For color, presence of B makes it brown; absence makes it checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are present: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment present, color absent: red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n- Pigment absent, color present: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- Both absent: plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 as before, corresponding to the squares of 2/3 and 1/3. So the options given don't include this exact ratio, but looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this, except option G: 12:2:2:2. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. To determine the counts, we can use the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F1 was CcBb, but according to the initial setup, the parents were CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb? Wait, no\u2014it's actually that F1 produces two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cC (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%)\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. The possible phenotypes are combinations of the C and B alleles.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. C dominant (C) and B dominant (B): red and brown \u2192 checkered red (prob: 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9)\n2. C dominant (C) and B recessive (b): red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown (2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9)\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): plain and brown \u2192 plain red (1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9)\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b): plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown (1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9)\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,8,4\n\nC. 9,3,9,3\n\nD. 1,3,1,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,2\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these exactly matches 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.5, but since we have to express whole numbers, the closest approximation isn't among the options. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way to compute the F2 phenotypic ratio is to consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Since both genes are acting independently, the possible phenotypic classes are combinations of their dominant and recessive states. Each gene has two possible states, leading to four phenotypic categories. The phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene's state.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- For the C locus: presence (red) is 2/3, absence (plain) is 1/3\n- For the B locus: presence (brown) is 2/3, absence (checkered) is 1/3\n\nEach phenotype is a combination of the C and B states. Therefore:\n\n1. C+ and B+: red and brown \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and B -: red and checkered \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n3. C- and B+: plain and brown \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n4. C- and B -: plain and checkered \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is 4/9 : 2/9 : 2/9 : 1/9.\n\nNow, converting this into the total number of birds, say 18 (the denominator 9), each class would be 8,4,4,2 respectively? Wait, no\u2014if the total is 9 parts, then 4 parts correspond to 8, 2 parts correspond to 4, another 2 parts to 4, and 1 part to 2. But that adds up to 18. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which would sum to 16, but our calculation suggests 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. In the options, the numbers are listed as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So for 18 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 of 18 = 8\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 of 18 = 4\n- Plain red: 2/9 of 18 = 4\n- Plain brown: 1/9 of 18 = 2\n\nWhich totals to 18 birds. This matches option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which translates to 8:4:4:2. So option F seems to represent 4:4:4:4, which might be a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect. Let me reconsider the parent genotypes. The problem states:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red bird)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown bird)\n\nWait, does \"checkered\" refer to the c allele, making the bird look checkered? So in terms of phenotype, the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene results in the respective color. Wait, but the problem defines:\n\n- Checkered is controlled by the recessive allele (b)\n- Plain is controlled by the dominant (c)\n- Pigment color (C) is dominant (red)\n- Brown (B) is dominant\n\nSo, for pigment color:\n\n- If C is present (any dominant allele), it's red\n- If c is present, it's plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- If B is present, it's brown\n- If b is present, it's checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown \u2192 C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n2. Red and Checkered \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 c present, B present \u2192 plain red\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 c present, B absent \u2192 plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, as before. So if the total number of birds is 9, the counts would be 4,2,2,1. But none of the options match this exactly.\n\nHowever, looking at option F, it says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That would imply a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). When crossed, the F1 should be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. Then, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- For pigment: presence (C) \u2192 red; absence (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color: presence (B) \u2192 brown; absence (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C+ and B+ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and b- \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c+ and B+ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c+ and b- \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C+ (2/3) and B+ (2/3): (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n- C+ (2/3) and b- (1/3): (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n- c+ (1/3) and B+ (2/3): (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n- c+ (1/3) and b- (1/3): (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nTotal birds: 9\n\nCounts:\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options exactly. Looking back at the options, option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which doesn't align with our calculations. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching.\n\nOption E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption F is checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This would require the ratio 1:1:1:1, which is not what we have here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the parents. Let me confirm: The problem states that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive, and the plain bird is homozygous dominant. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). So the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. The F2 would then be:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe F2 phenotypes:\n\n1. C+ and B+ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C+ and b- \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c+ and B+ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c+ and b- \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nCalculating the expected counts for 9 birds:\n\n- C+ (2/3) * B+ (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 checkered red\n- C+ (2/3) * b- (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 checkered brown\n- c+ (1/3) * B+ (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 plain red\n- c+ (1/3) * b- (1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo in a group of 9 birds, we'd expect approximately 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. This doesn't match any of the options provided, indicating either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the F2 generation is the same as the F1 generation, which is CcBb, and thus the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. In that case, checking the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would suggest a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a 3:1 ratio in a monohybrid cross. However, this scenario doesn't fit our current problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and CC bb. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC). Thus, parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, and the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which can be represented as 2:1:1:0.5 when normalized to 9 birds. However, none of the options match this. The closest option is F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, but this implies a ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-express it as fractions:\n\nCheckered red: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 4\nCheckered brown: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 2\nPlain red: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 2\nPlain brown: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 1\n\nIf we round to the nearest integer, it becomes 4:2:2:1, which doesn't match any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I must have made an error elsewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the initial F1: CC BB and cc bb produce CcBb. Then, F2 would be:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype instead of percentages.

Pigment red and Brown \u2192 9 cases (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 3 cases (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 3 cases (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 1 case (c and B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Perhaps the options are counting actual numbers rather than percentages.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is too low. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 also sums to 16, which matches 9:3:3:1 but distributed incorrectly. If the question asks for the exact count without simplifying, then 9:3:3:1 corresponds to 9,3,3,1 respectively. None of the options match exactly. Wait, option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, but the ratio isn't 9:3:3:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the actual counts based on the F2 generation. Let me try that. The F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014they can only produce CB and cb, as per the parents' genotypes. So the F2 will have four types of gametes, each appearing equally likely (25%). Therefore, the F2 will have four types of birds: 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb).\n\nNow, applying the rules for dominance:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the F2 birds will have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red, B dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red, B recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. 25% cc \u2192 Pigment plain, B dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. 25% bb \u2192 Pigment plain, B recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, counting these:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain and Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% \u2192 1 part\n\nAgain, the ratio seems to be 1:1:1:1, but this contradicts earlier calculations where I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1. This discrepancy suggests I might be misunderstanding the genetics here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Let me assume a population of 16 birds.\n\nIf each bird is equally likely to be any of the four F2 genotypes, then:\n\n- 4 birds with Pigment red and Brown\n- 4 birds with Pigment red and Checkered\n- 4 birds with Plain and Brown\n- 4 birds with Plain and Checkered\n\nTotal: 16 birds. Thus, the phenotypic distribution would be 4:4:4:4, i.e., each phenotype equally represented. But none of the options match this either. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sums to 12. Not matching 16.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sums to 16. That fits 4:2:4:2, which is different from 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sums to 16. Again, different from 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible outcomes of the F2 generation. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red, B dominant \u2192 Brown (red-brown)\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red, B recessive \u2192 Checkered (red-checkered)\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment plain, B dominant \u2192 Brown (plain-brown)\n4. bb \u2192 Pigment plain, B recessive \u2192 Checkered (plain-checkered)\n\nIn terms of phenotypic ratio, each of these four genotypes would result in one phenotype, but how many birds have each?\n\nIf the F2 generation is 16 birds:\n\n- CC: 4 birds (since 25% of 16 is 4)\n- Cc: 8 birds (50% of 16 is 8)\n- cc: 4 birds (25% of 16 is 4)\n- bb: 4 birds (25% of 16 is 4)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 birds (from CC and Cc?)\nWait no: Wait, CC is Pigment red and B present \u2192 Brown. Cc is Pigment red and B absent \u2192 Checkered. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC) + 8 (from Cc?) Wait, no. Wait, CC is Pigment red and B present \u2192 Brown. Cc is Pigment red and B absent \u2192 Checkered. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC) \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 8 (from Cc) \u2192 8 birds\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (from cc) \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (from bb) \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, but 4+8+4+4=20, which exceeds 16. I must have made a miscalculation. Let me recompute:\n\nWait, 16 birds divided into four groups: 4, 8, 4, 4.\n\nThus,\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 birds (from CC and Cc?) Wait, no. From above analysis, each genotype results in one phenotype. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 8 birds\n- cc \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nAdding up to 20, which is wrong. I must have miscounted. Correctly, each group should add up to 16:\n\nIf 16 birds:\n\n- CC: 4 birds\n- Cc: 8 birds\n- cc: 4 birds\n- bb: 4 birds\n\nThen:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 8 (from Cc)\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (from cc)\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (from bb)\n\nBut that totals 20, which is impossible. So my grouping is off. Let's recalculate:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes, each with equal frequency in a large population. Therefore, each genotype (4, 8, 4, 4) appears in equal proportion. But each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- 4 birds with CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- 8 birds with Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- 4 birds with cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- 4 birds with bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:8:4:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. However, this still doesn't align with any of the answer options except possibly option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's a 2:6:3:1 ratio, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of birds in each genotype. In reality, the F2 generation should have four equal segments, each with 25% frequency. So, in 100 birds:\n\n- CC: 25\n- Cc: 50\n- cc: 25\n- bb: 25\n\nThus, in 100 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25 (CC) + 25 (Cc?) No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these four genotypes occurs with 25% frequency. Therefore, in 100 birds:\n\n- 25 are CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- 25 are Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- 25 are cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- 25 are bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25\n- Plain and Brown: 25\n- Plain and Checkered: 25\n\nThis implies a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this isn't among the answer options. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratio would be 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16, and ratio 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, which is not 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't make sense as it's under 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 which is a 1:3:3:1 pattern, similar to a trihybrid cross, but not applicable here.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go back. The correct way is that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) would result in four genotypes, each with 25% frequency. Each genotype then translates to a specific phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, as each phenotype is equally likely. But this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the options are considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of birds, but perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation refers to the offspring of the two F1 individuals, and each F1 can produce four types of gametes. Therefore, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but some phenotypes may overlap. However, in reality, each bird has two separate genes, so the F2 would have 16 birds, each with a unique genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to match 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options again, option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 adding up to 12, which is less than 16. Option H has a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the F2 generation refers to the result of a dihybrid cross between a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird, not a dihybrid cross between F1 individuals. Let me read the original question again.\n\nAh! Wait, the original question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nIt then asks about a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous plain brown\n\nWait, hold on. If Parent 1 is CC BB, that means both genes are dominant (C and B), resulting in the dominant phenotype. But wait, according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color by B. So if a bird has the dominant C and dominant B, it would be checkered red. If it has dominant C and recessive B, it would be red with plain color (wait, no: if B is recessive, the bird is plain). Similarly, if it has recessive C and dominant B, it's brown. And if it has recessive C and recessive B, it's plain.\n\nWait, now I see. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so the phenotype is checkered red.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both genes are recessive, so the phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, what would the F1 look like? Each parent can only produce one type of gamete due to their genotype being homozygous. So Parent 1 can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and each bird would express the combined phenotype based on the genes.\n\nWait, but the question is about a dihybrid cross, implying that the parents are not homozygous. So perhaps the confusion arises from the wording of the question. Let me re-examine the original question:\n\n\"Adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, that would mean both parents are homozygous. So:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each parent contributes gametes with a certain probability, the F2 will have a specific distribution.\n\nWait, going back, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence (red): CC and Cc \u2192 75%\n- Absence (plain): cc \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the body color (B):\n\n- Presence (brown): BB and Bc \u2192 75%\n- Absence (checkered): bb \u2192 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratios are obtained by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown: (75% * 75%) = 56.25% \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered: (75% * 25%) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain AND Brown: (25% * 75%) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain AND Checkered: (25% * 25%) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 9:3:3:1. But wait, the options given don't include a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, looking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype instead of percentages. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 9 parts\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 1 part\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 summing to 16, which is less than 16.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 same issue.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 9 cases (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 3 cases (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 3 cases (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 1 case (c and B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Perhaps the options are counting actual numbers rather than percentages.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is too low. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 also sums to 16, which matches 9:3:3:1 but distributed incorrectly. If the question asks for the exact count without simplifying, then 9:3:3:1 corresponds to 9,3,3,1 respectively. None of the options match exactly. Wait, option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, but the ratio isn't 9:3:3:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the actual counts based on the F2 generation. Let me try that. The F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014they can only produce CB and cb, as per the parents' genotypes. So the F2 will have four types of gametes, each appearing equally likely (25%). Therefore, the F2 will have four types of birds: 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb).\n\nNow, applying the rules for dominance:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the F2 birds will have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red, B dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red, B recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. 25% cc \u2192 Pigment plain, B dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. 25% bb \u2192 Pigment plain, B recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, counting these:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain and Brown: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% \u2192 1 part\n\nAgain, the ratio seems to be 1:1:1:1, but this contradicts earlier calculations where I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1. This discrepancy suggests I might be misunderstanding the genetics here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Let me assume a population of 16 birds.\n\nIf each bird is equally likely to be any of the four F2 genotypes, then:\n\n- 4 birds with Pigment red and Brown\n- 4 birds with Pigment red and Checkered\n- 4 birds with Plain and Brown\n- 4 birds with Plain and Checkered\n\nTotal: 16 birds. Thus, the phenotypic distribution would be 4:4:4:4, i.e., each phenotype equally represented. But none of the options match this either. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sums to 12. Not matching 16.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sums to 16. That fits 4:2:4:2, which is different from 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sums to 16. Again, different from 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible outcomes of the F2 generation. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red, B dominant \u2192 Brown (red-brown)\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red, B recessive \u2192 Checkered (red-checkered)\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment plain, B dominant \u2192 Brown (plain-brown)\n4. bb \u2192 Pigment plain, B recessive \u2192 Checkered (plain-checkered)\n\nIn terms of phenotypic ratio, each of these four genotypes would result in one phenotype, but how many birds have each?\n\nIf the F2 generation is 16 birds:\n\n- CC: 4 birds (since 25% of 16 is 4)\n- Cc: 8 birds (50% of 16 is 8)\n- cc: 4 birds (25% of 16 is 4)\n- bb: 4 birds (25% of 16 is 4)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 birds (from CC and Cc?)\nWait no: Wait, CC is Pigment red and B present \u2192 Brown. Cc is Pigment red and B absent \u2192 Checkered. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC) + 8 (from Cc?) Wait, no. Wait, CC is Pigment red and B present \u2192 Brown. Cc is Pigment red and B absent \u2192 Checkered. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC) \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 8 (from Cc) \u2192 8 birds\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (from cc) \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (from bb) \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, but 4+8+4+4=20, which exceeds 16. I must have made a miscalculation. Let me recompute:\n\nWait, 16 birds divided into four groups: 4, 8, 4, 4.\n\nThus,\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 birds (from CC and Cc?) Wait, no. From above analysis, each genotype results in one phenotype. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 8 birds\n- cc \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nAdding up to 20, which is wrong. I must have miscounted. Correctly, each group should add up to 16:\n\nIf 16 birds:\n\n- CC: 4 birds\n- Cc: 8 birds\n- cc: 4 birds\n- bb: 4 birds\n\nThen:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 4 (from CC)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 8 (from Cc)\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (from cc)\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (from bb)\n\nBut that totals 20, which is impossible. So my grouping is off. Let's recalculate:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of four possible genotypes, each with equal frequency in a large population. Therefore, each genotype (4, 8, 4, 4) appears in equal proportion. But each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- 4 birds with CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- 8 birds with Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- 4 birds with cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- 4 birds with bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:8:4:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1. However, this still doesn't align with any of the answer options except possibly option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's a 2:6:3:1 ratio, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of birds in each genotype. In reality, the F2 generation should have four equal segments, each with 25% frequency. So, in 100 birds:\n\n- CC: 25\n- Cc: 50\n- cc: 25\n- bb: 25\n\nThus, in 100 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25 (CC) + 25 (Cc?) No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these four genotypes occurs with 25% frequency. Therefore, in 100 birds:\n\n- 25 are CC \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- 25 are Cc \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- 25 are cc \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- 25 are bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25\n- Plain and Brown: 25\n- Plain and Checkered: 25\n\nThis implies a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this isn't among the answer options. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratio would be 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16, and ratio 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, which is not 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't make sense as it's under 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16, ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 which is a 1:3:3:1 pattern, similar to a trihybrid cross, but not applicable here.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go back. The correct way is that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) would result in four genotypes, each with 25% frequency. Each genotype then translates to a specific phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, as each phenotype is equally likely. But this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the options are considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of birds, but perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation refers to the offspring of the two F1 individuals, and each F1 can produce four types of gametes. Therefore, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but some phenotypes may overlap. However, in reality, each bird has two separate genes, so the F2 would have 16 birds, each with a unique genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to match 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options again, option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 adding up to 12, which is less than 16. Option H has a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the F2 generation refers to the result of a dihybrid cross between a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird, not a dihybrid cross between F1 individuals. Let me read the original question again.\n\nAh! Wait, the original question says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nIt then asks about a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous plain brown\n\nWait, hold on. If Parent 1 is CC BB, that means both genes are dominant (C and B), resulting in the dominant phenotype. But wait, according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color by B. So if a bird has the dominant C and dominant B, it would be checkered red. If it has dominant C and recessive B, it would be red with plain color (wait, no: if B is recessive, the bird is plain). Similarly, if it has recessive C and dominant B, it's brown. And if it has recessive C and recessive B, it's plain.\n\nWait, now I see. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so the phenotype is checkered red.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both genes are recessive, so the phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, what would the F1 look like? Each parent can only produce one type of gamete due to their genotype being homozygous. So Parent 1 can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and each bird would express the combined phenotype based on the genes.\n\nWait, but the question is about a dihybrid cross, implying that the parents are not homozygous. So perhaps the confusion arises from the wording of the question. Let me re-examine the original question:\n\n\"Adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, that would mean both parents are homozygous. So:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous checkered red\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that each gene is independently assorting, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is (probabilities for each gene) combined.",
    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independently assorting, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is (probabilities for each gene) combined.\n\nWait, but let's approach this systematically. First, determine the possible genotypes for each gene in the F2 generation. Each gene follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. The C locus has two alleles, both dominant (since CC is shown), leading to the presence of pigment (red) and absence (plain). Similarly, B locus: dominant B results in brown, recessive b results in checkered.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B (body color):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nThe possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, consider the pigment color (C locus):\n\n- Probability of C being present (dominant): 100% (since CC and Cc are both red)\n- Probability of c being absent (recessive): 100%\n\nSecond, consider the body color (B locus):\n\n- Probability of B being present (dominant): 100%\n- Probability of b being absent (recessive): 100%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined solely by whether each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele. Since both genes are fully dominant (i.e., no recessive phenotype without the dominant allele), each bird will exhibit either red or plain for pigment, and either brown or checkered for body color.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, but the interaction might affect the phenotype. However, in this context, it seems that each trait is expressed regardless of the other. So, the phenotype for pigment is red if C is present (either C or Cc), and plain if c is present. Similarly, the body color is brown if B is present (either B or Bb), and checkered if b is present.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c present) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these phenotypes depends on both genes having dominant alleles. Since both genes are fully dominant, the phenotype will reflect the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (Probability of C present) \u00d7 (Probability of B present) = 1 \u00d7 1 = 100%\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because it implies 100% chance of red and brown, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where the phenotypes are a mix depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. In reality, each bird must express both traits simultaneously, meaning that the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to the corresponding phenotype. However, in this case, since both genes are fully dominant, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has a dominant allele.\n\nLet me reevaluate:\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant:\n   - Probability of C dominant: 1 (since CC and Cc are both red)\n   - Probability of B dominant: 1 (since BB and Bb are both brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 \u00d7 1 = 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n\n2. C dominant, B recessive:\n   - Probability of C dominant: 1\n   - Probability of B recessive: 1/2 (since Bb is brown, bb is checkered)\n   - Combined probability: 1 \u00d7 1/2 = 50% \u2192 Plain red\n\n3. C recessive, B dominant:\n   - Probability of C recessive: 1/2 (since cc is plain)\n   - Probability of B dominant: 1\n   - Combined probability: 1/2 \u00d7 1 = 50% \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n4. Both C and B recessive:\n   - Probability of C recessive: 1/2\n   - Probability of B recessive: 1/2\n   - Combined probability: 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 100% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 25%? That adds to 25%, which doesn't make sense because probabilities should sum to 100%.\n\nWait, no\u2014it sums to 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates a miscalculation. Let's correct this.\n\nActually, the correct way is to recognize that each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic ratios are calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. The four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n2. C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n3. C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n4. C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nBut adding these gives 100% (25% \u00d7 4 = 100%). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s correct. Because each gene is segregating into two possibilities, and the combinations are equally likely.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations earlier, the probabilities were different. Let me recalculate properly.\n\nEach gene segregates into two possibilities (for C and B), and since they are independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) \u00d7 (probability of B).\n\nFor C:\n- Probability of C dominant (C) = 100% (since CC and Cc are both red)\n- Probability of C recessive (c) = 50% (cc is plain)\n\nFor B:\n- Probability of B dominant (B) = 100% (BB and Bb are both brown)\n- Probability of B recessive (b) = 50% (bb is checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic probabilities are:\n\n1. C (red) AND B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (1 \u00d7 1 = 100%?) No, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So, the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c dominant) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene contributing the dominant allele:\n\n1. C dominant AND B dominant \u2192 1 \u00d7 1 = 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant AND B recessive \u2192 1 \u00d7 1/2 = 50% \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive AND B dominant \u2192 1/2 \u00d7 1 = 50% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. C recessive AND B recessive \u2192 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these percentages: 100% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150% \u2192 This suggests an error in calculation. The correct approach is to realize that each bird must have both dominant alleles in both genes to display the corresponding phenotype. Thus, the actual probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThis makes the total 100% when summed. Therefore, each phenotype has a 25% probability in the F2 generation.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the given choices again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios. For example, option E says 3:9:1:3, which might correspond to a different scenario. Option G states 12:2:2:0, which also seems off. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which could represent a different distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Maybe the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, not necessarily both. That would mean that any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene would exhibit the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the other gene. Let me explore this alternative interpretation.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in C OR at least one dominant allele in B \u2192 Checkered red (all cases except when both are recessive)\n2. At least one dominant allele in C \u2192 Pigmented red\n3. At least one dominant allele in B \u2192 Brown\n4. None dominant alleles \u2192 Plain\n\nBut wait, in this case, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene would lead to the respective phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C allele\n- Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B allele\n- Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor dominant B alleles\n\nIn this scenario, the number of phenotypes isn't reduced to four distinct ones like before; instead, the phenotypes are grouped into pigmented red, brown, and plain, with pigmented red including those with a dominant B allele even if the C allele is recessive, and similarly for brown.\n\nHowever, this complicates the Punnett square analysis because now the F2 generation will have a different distribution of these phenotypes. Let me try recalculating under this assumption.\n\nUnder this new interpretation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red\n2. Brown\n3. Plain\n\nWith the following conditions:\n\n- Pigmented red: C dominant (any B) or B dominant (any C)\n- Brown: B dominant\n- Plain: Neither C nor B dominant\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation's possible genotypes and their phenotypes can be determined.\n\nFrom the previous F2 generation:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (pigs red)\n- CC bb (pigs plain)\n- cc BB (pigs plain)\n- cc bb (pigs plain)\n\nEach of these will express the appropriate phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigmented red (same reason)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain (no C or B dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, under this interpretation, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigmented red: 50% (since 2 out of 4)\n- Brown: 25% (only cc BB)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nWhich matches option J's ratio of 2:6:2, but wait, that's 2 parts pigmented red, 6 parts brown, and 2 parts plain. That doesn't align with our current calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to treat each gene independently, resulting in four phenotypic classes as initially considered. If that's the case, then each phenotype has a 25% probability in the F2 generation, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 This resembles a dihybrid cross with 3 phenotypes, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but our scenario assumes complete dominance, leading to four phenotypes.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 This seems like a scenario where some phenotypes have higher counts, possibly due to the dominance hierarchy affecting the outcome.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Again, similar to E, suggesting incomplete dominance.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Equal distribution among four phenotypes, which wouldn't fit our scenario unless each gene contributes equally, but under complete dominance, this shouldn't happen.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Doesn't match our expectations.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6 \u2192 Two phenotypes, which may occur if certain traits mask others, but that's speculative.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Two phenotypes, same reasoning as above.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which might suggest incomplete dominance or another factor.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Four phenotypes, which might come from a different model.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which might indicate a different genetic structure.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Four equal phenotypes.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Two phenotypes with high and low counts, which might arise from partial dominance or other factors.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Mixed ratios.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Mixed ratios.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Again, three phenotypes with varying counts.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIf the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, then the phenotypic ratios aren't based on the combination of both genes but rather on whether each gene has a dominant allele.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C allele\n2. Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B allele\n3. Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor dominant B alleles\n\nUnder this model, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nThe probability of Pigmented red is the probability of having at least one dominant C allele plus the probability of having at least one dominant B allele minus the probability of having both dominant C and B alleles (to avoid double-counting).\n\nUsing the formula for independent events:\n\nP(Pigmented red) = 1 - P(no C) * P(no B) = 1 - (1/4)(1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nBut this doesn't account for the dominance hierarchy. Under our assumption of complete dominance, every bird with a dominant allele in either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype, regardless of the other gene.\n\nWait, that's not quite right. If both genes are completely dominant, then any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratios would be determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: presence of at least one dominant C\n2. Brown: presence of at least one dominant B\n3. Plain: absence of both dominant alleles\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16\n\nNumber of genotypes for Pigmented red (at least one C):\n\nAll except cc. Since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C is Pigmented red. The number of such genotypes is 12 (since only 4 are cc: cc BB, cc BB, cc bb, cc bb, totaling 4).\n\nWait, no: The total number of possible genotypes for each gene is 3 (CC, Cc, cc), so for two genes, it's 9. But since we're considering F2, each gene segregates into 3 possibilities, leading to 9 x 9 = 81 possible genotype combinations, but with independence, the actual phenotypic distribution depends on the dominant alleles.\n\nBut under our complete dominance assumption, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of genotypes that meet the criteria for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigmented red (at least one dominant C):\n\n- All genotypes except cc BB and cc bb (wait, no, in terms of the two genes, it's any bird with at least one dominant allele in C or B.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype.\n\nBut this approach is time-consuming. Instead, let's use the principle that in a dihybrid cross with complete dominance, the phenotypic ratio in F2 is 9:3:3:1. However, this refers to a situation where each trait is independently expressed, and there's no interaction between them. But in our case, the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the phenotype of the other gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are completely dominant, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, not the combination. So, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C or B\n2. Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B\n3. Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor B\n\nWait, that's not accurate because Pigmented red includes all cases where either C or B is dominant, while Brown is only when B is dominant, regardless of C. Similarly, Plain is only when neither C nor B is dominant.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant allele (C or B)\n2. Brown: any",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independently assorting, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is (probabilities for each gene) combined.\n\nWait, but let's approach this systematically. First, determine the possible genotypes for each gene in the F2 generation. Each gene follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. The C locus has two alleles, both dominant (since CC is shown), leading to the presence of pigment (red) and absence (plain). Similarly, B locus: dominant B results in brown, recessive b results in checkered.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for B (body color):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nThe possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, consider the pigment color (C locus):\n\n- Probability of C being present (dominant): 100% (since CC and Cc are both red)\n- Probability of c being absent (recessive): 100%\n\nSecond, consider the body color (B locus):\n\n- Probability of B being present (dominant): 100%\n- Probability of b being absent (recessive): 100%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined solely by whether each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele. Since both genes are fully dominant (i.e., no recessive phenotype without the dominant allele), each bird will exhibit either red or plain for pigment, and either brown or checkered for body color.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, but the interaction might affect the phenotype. However, in this context, it seems that each trait is expressed regardless of the other. So, the phenotype for pigment is red if C is present (either C or Cc), and plain if c is present. Similarly, the body color is brown if B is present (either B or Bb), and checkered if b is present.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c present) AND Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c present) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these phenotypes depends on both genes having dominant alleles. Since both genes are fully dominant, the phenotype will reflect the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red (C present) AND Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (Probability of C present) \u00d7 (Probability of B present) = 1 \u00d7 1 = 100%\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because it implies 100% chance of red and brown, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where the phenotypes are a mix depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. In reality, each bird must express both traits simultaneously, meaning that the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to the corresponding phenotype. However, in this case, since both genes are fully dominant, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has a dominant allele.\n\nLet me reevaluate:\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant:\n   - Probability of C dominant: 1 (since CC and Cc are both red)\n   - Probability of B dominant: 1 (since BB and Bb are both brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 \u00d7 1 = 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n\n2. C dominant, B recessive:\n   - Probability of C dominant: 1\n   - Probability of B recessive: 1/2 (since Bb is brown, bb is checkered)\n   - Combined probability: 1 \u00d7 1/2 = 50% \u2192 Plain red\n\n3. C recessive, B dominant:\n   - Probability of C recessive: 1/2 (since cc is plain)\n   - Probability of B dominant: 1\n   - Combined probability: 1/2 \u00d7 1 = 50% \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n4. Both C and B recessive:\n   - Probability of C recessive: 1/2\n   - Probability of B recessive: 1/2\n   - Combined probability: 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 100% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 25%? That adds to 25%, which doesn't make sense because probabilities should sum to 100%.\n\nWait, no\u2014it sums to 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates a miscalculation. Let's correct this.\n\nActually, the correct way is to recognize that each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic ratios are calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. The four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n2. C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n3. C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n4. C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nBut adding these gives 100% (25% \u00d7 4 = 100%). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s correct. Because each gene is segregating into two possibilities, and the combinations are equally likely.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations earlier, the probabilities were different. Let me recalculate properly.\n\nEach gene segregates into two possibilities (for C and B), and since they are independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C) \u00d7 (probability of B).\n\nFor C:\n- Probability of C dominant (C) = 100% (since CC and Cc are both red)\n- Probability of C recessive (c) = 50% (cc is plain)\n\nFor B:\n- Probability of B dominant (B) = 100% (BB and Bb are both brown)\n- Probability of B recessive (b) = 50% (bb is checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic probabilities are:\n\n1. C (red) AND B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red (1 \u00d7 1 = 100%?) No, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So, the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c dominant) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene contributing the dominant allele:\n\n1. C dominant AND B dominant \u2192 1 \u00d7 1 = 100% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant AND B recessive \u2192 1 \u00d7 1/2 = 50% \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive AND B dominant \u2192 1/2 \u00d7 1 = 50% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. C recessive AND B recessive \u2192 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 = 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these percentages: 100% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150% \u2192 This suggests an error in calculation. The correct approach is to realize that each bird must have both dominant alleles in both genes to display the corresponding phenotype. Thus, the actual probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThis makes the total 100% when summed. Therefore, each phenotype has a 25% probability in the F2 generation.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the given choices again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios. For example, option E says 3:9:1:3, which might correspond to a different scenario. Option G states 12:2:2:0, which also seems off. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which could represent a different distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Maybe the question considers that the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, not necessarily both. That would mean that any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene would exhibit the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the other gene. Let me explore this alternative interpretation.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in C OR at least one dominant allele in B \u2192 Checkered red (all cases except when both are recessive)\n2. At least one dominant allele in C \u2192 Pigmented red\n3. At least one dominant allele in B \u2192 Brown\n4. None dominant alleles \u2192 Plain\n\nBut wait, in this case, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene would lead to the respective phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C allele\n- Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B allele\n- Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor dominant B alleles\n\nIn this scenario, the number of phenotypes isn't reduced to four distinct ones like before; instead, the phenotypes are grouped into pigmented red, brown, and plain, with pigmented red including those with a dominant B allele even if the C allele is recessive, and similarly for brown.\n\nHowever, this complicates the Punnett square analysis because now the F2 generation will have a different distribution of these phenotypes. Let me try recalculating under this assumption.\n\nUnder this new interpretation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red\n2. Brown\n3. Plain\n\nWith the following conditions:\n\n- Pigmented red: C dominant (any B) or B dominant (any C)\n- Brown: B dominant\n- Plain: Neither C nor B dominant\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation's possible genotypes and their phenotypes can be determined.\n\nFrom the previous F2 generation:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (pigs red)\n- CC bb (pigs plain)\n- cc BB (pigs plain)\n- cc bb (pigs plain)\n\nEach of these will express the appropriate phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigmented red (same reason)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain (no C or B dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, under this interpretation, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigmented red: 50% (since 2 out of 4)\n- Brown: 25% (only cc BB)\n- Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nWhich matches option J's ratio of 2:6:2, but wait, that's 2 parts pigmented red, 6 parts brown, and 2 parts plain. That doesn't align with our current calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to treat each gene independently, resulting in four phenotypic classes as initially considered. If that's the case, then each phenotype has a 25% probability in the F2 generation, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 This resembles a dihybrid cross with 3 phenotypes, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but our scenario assumes complete dominance, leading to four phenotypes.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 This seems like a scenario where some phenotypes have higher counts, possibly due to the dominance hierarchy affecting the outcome.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Again, similar to E, suggesting incomplete dominance.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Equal distribution among four phenotypes, which wouldn't fit our scenario unless each gene contributes equally, but under complete dominance, this shouldn't happen.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Doesn't match our expectations.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6 \u2192 Two phenotypes, which may occur if certain traits mask others, but that's speculative.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Two phenotypes, same reasoning as above.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which might suggest incomplete dominance or another factor.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Four phenotypes, which might come from a different model.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which might indicate a different genetic structure.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Four equal phenotypes.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Two phenotypes with high and low counts, which might arise from partial dominance or other factors.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Mixed ratios.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Mixed ratios.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Again, three phenotypes with varying counts.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIf the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective phenotype, then the phenotypic ratios aren't based on the combination of both genes but rather on whether each gene has a dominant allele.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C allele\n2. Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B allele\n3. Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor dominant B alleles\n\nUnder this model, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios can be determined as follows:\n\nThe probability of Pigmented red is the probability of having at least one dominant C allele plus the probability of having at least one dominant B allele minus the probability of having both dominant C and B alleles (to avoid double-counting).\n\nUsing the formula for independent events:\n\nP(Pigmented red) = 1 - P(no C) * P(no B) = 1 - (1/4)(1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nBut this doesn't account for the dominance hierarchy. Under our assumption of complete dominance, every bird with a dominant allele in either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype, regardless of the other gene.\n\nWait, that's not quite right. If both genes are completely dominant, then any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratios would be determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: presence of at least one dominant C\n2. Brown: presence of at least one dominant B\n3. Plain: absence of both dominant alleles\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16\n\nNumber of genotypes for Pigmented red (at least one C):\n\nAll except cc. Since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C is Pigmented red. The number of such genotypes is 12 (since only 4 are cc: cc BB, cc BB, cc bb, cc bb, totaling 4).\n\nWait, no: The total number of possible genotypes for each gene is 3 (CC, Cc, cc), so for two genes, it's 9. But since we're considering F2, each gene segregates into 3 possibilities, leading to 9 x 9 = 81 possible genotype combinations, but with independence, the actual phenotypic distribution depends on the dominant alleles.\n\nBut under our complete dominance assumption, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of genotypes that meet the criteria for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigmented red (at least one dominant C):\n\n- All genotypes except cc BB and cc bb (wait, no, in terms of the two genes, it's any bird with at least one dominant allele in C or B.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype.\n\nBut this approach is time-consuming. Instead, let's use the principle that in a dihybrid cross with complete dominance, the phenotypic ratio in F2 is 9:3:3:1. However, this refers to a situation where each trait is independently expressed, and there's no interaction between them. But in our case, the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the phenotype of the other gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are completely dominant, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, not the combination. So, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant C or B\n2. Brown: any bird with at least one dominant B\n3. Plain: any bird with neither dominant C nor B\n\nWait, that's not accurate because Pigmented red includes all cases where either C or B is dominant, while Brown is only when B is dominant, regardless of C. Similarly, Plain is only when neither C nor B is dominant.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red: any bird with at least one dominant allele (C or B)\n2. Brown: any",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Since each gene is independent and follows Mendelian inheritance, the overall phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of having at least one C (dominant): 3/4 (since probability of cc is 1/4)\n- Probability of being plain (no C): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- Probability of having at least one B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of being checkered (no B): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (C absent) and brown (B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (C absent) and checkered (B absent): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. Checking the options, option G says phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The phenotypic ratio is based on the number of each phenotype. Each bird has two traits, so there are four possible phenotypes, not nine. My earlier approach might have been confused because I was thinking in terms of four categories instead of four phenotypes. Let me re-examine.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. Each trait has three possible phenotypes based on dominance, but since each trait is controlled by one gene, the possible combinations are four:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_ )\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb )\n3. Plain (cc ) and brown (BB )\n4. Plain (cc ) and checkered (bb )\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C and B are present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts. This means checkered red is phenotype 2, checkered brown is phenotype 3, plain red is phenotype 1, and plain brown is phenotype 4. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option G. Looking back at the options, option G states: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". Hmm, that seems off because my calculation shows 9:3:3:1, not those numbers. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes. Maybe the checkered red is phenotype 1, checkered brown is phenotype 2, plain red is phenotype 3, and plain brown is phenotype 4. That would change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the way the options are phrased is different. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with 9:3:3:1. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is 3:1:3:1 scaled up. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option D: 1,3,9,3. That would imply a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which isn't what we have. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 2:1:0:1. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 which is our desired ratio. Yes, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But looking back, the options given include option G, which is checkered red 12, etc., but according to my calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C if the numbers were 9,3,3,1, but none of the options directly say that except for option C, which is slightly different. Wait, no. Let me check the exact wording of the options.\n\nWait, the original options provided in the user's message seem to have specific counts like 6, 8, 9, etc. Looking back, the user presented the options as:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nBut according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So why does option G exist with different numbers? Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to the bird being plain-red or plain-brown. Let me recount the phenotypic ratios properly. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present): 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent): 3/16\n3. Plain (C absent) and brown (B present): 3/16\n4. Plain (C absent) and checkered (B absent): 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into the actual count based on the parent combinations. Since each parent contributes one allele, the F2 generation will have four possible phenotypes. For example, 9 out of 16 birds will be of the first phenotype, 3 out of 16 will be the second, and so on. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect 9:3:3:1 except possibly option C, which lists 9,3,3,1. But in the options, option C is written as: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which matches exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and option G is supposed to be 9:3:3:1, which would mean option G is correct. But upon closer inspection, the user's options don't list 9:3:3:1, only some other ratios. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement, the options are labeled A through J, with various ratios. According to my analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C if the counts were 9,3,3,1. But checking the options again, option G lists 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

However, in reality, some traits might overlap, but in this case, since C and B are separate genes, all four phenotypes are distinct. So the expected phenotypic ratio in F2 would be 1:1:1:1, leading to four phenotypes. Wait, but looking back at the options given, none of them seem to suggest a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum to 16\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum to 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum to 16\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 sum to 16\nWait, all options add up to 16, which makes sense because each F2 generation has 16 individuals.\n\nBut how do the actual counts translate into phenotypic ratios?

Assuming complete dominance and no blending, the expected number for each phenotype is 4 (since 1/4 of 16 is 4). But looking at the options, option C says 9:3:3:1, which would mean 9 of one phenotype, 3 each of others, totaling 16. That suggests that some phenotypes are more frequent than others. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation involves the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Let me re-examine the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFor the C locus (gene):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (gene):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene, but since the genes are independent, the combined effect can lead to different phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypic combinations for each bird are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 same as above?\nWait, no, the presence of B alleles affects the color. Wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, regardless of the other. So for pigment, if at least one C allele is present, it's red. Similarly, for color, if at least one B allele is present, it's brown. So the phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown color (if C and B are both present)\n- Pigment red and Checkered (if C present, B absent)\n- Plain and Brown (if c and B present)\n- Plain and Checkered (if c and B absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype in F2.\n\nSince both genes are being considered, and each parent is a pure line (homozygous for both genes), the F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be the next generation.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate the probability of each phenotype occurring.\n\nFirst, for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: probability of C (red) = 3/4, c (plain) = 1/4\n- Gene B: probability of B (brown) = 3/4, b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nThe presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene has at least one dominant allele.\n\nFor the phenotype to be Pigment red and Brown color (both C and B present):\n\nProbability = (prob C) * (prob B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nFor Pigment red and Checkered (only C present, B absent):\n\nProbability = (prob C) * (prob b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Plain and Brown (only c and B present):\n\nProbability = (prob c) * (prob B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor Plain and Checkered (only c and B absent):\n\nProbability = (prob c) * (prob b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9 out of 16 are Pigment red and Brown\n- 3 out are Pigment red and Checkered\n- 3 out are Plain and Brown\n- 1 out is Plain and Checkered\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nC.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Given that each parent contributes gametes in a 1:1 ratio, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 distribution across the four phenotypic categories, but some may combine into fewer phenotypes due to overlapping traits. Wait, no\u2014if both traits are independent and each gene determines the trait without affecting the other, then all four phenotypes will appear.

Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain checkered: 25%\n\nThis would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes. But looking back at the options given, none of them match this exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will show red pigment.\n- B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will show brown color.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are indeed as I listed earlier. But none of the options provided have equal ratios. Wait, let me look again at the options:\n\nOptions A through H don't have equal ratios. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which seems too high for a 4-proportional system. Similarly, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, adding to 12. Option G has 12,2,2,0, totaling 16. Maybe I've misunderstood the problem's context.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2. Because in the initial setup, the user provided gametes for F1, which was CcBb, but then proceeded to F2. However, the question asks specifically about the F2 generation. So going back, perhaps my initial analysis is wrong because the problem mentions a checkered bird, which implies a specific genotype like CcBb. But in reality, checkered animals usually have both C and c alleles (so Cc), and both B and b alleles (so Bb), leading to a phenotype where both traits are expressed incompletely. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have various genotypes. \n\nWait, but according to the options, none of them have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem isn't asking about the F2 generation but rather about the phenotypic ratio observed after a certain number of generations, such as after one generation (F1) or perhaps another way. Alternatively, maybe the question is miswritten, and the intended answer is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the F1 cross differently. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1. As I previously thought, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (checkered red)\n- 25% CcBb (checkered brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain red)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% for each. However, this isn't reflected in any of the options provided. All the options suggest a different ratio. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, looking back, the question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these, as discussed earlier.\n\nSince each trait follows a 2:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), the combined phenotypes would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this. So perhaps the question is referring to a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe I need to calculate the ratios based on the number of each genotype in F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n\nWait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then F2 would have the following:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, that's correct. Now, for each of these, what are the phenotypes?\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 checkered red (1/4)\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 checkered brown (1/4)\n- cc bb: Plain, Brown \u2192 plain brown (1/4)\n- cc BB: Plain, Red \u2192 plain red (1/4)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment of the genes, but that would complicate things further. Another possibility is that the question is about the F1 generation instead of F2, but the initial instruction said to focus on F2.\n\nWait, looking again, the user provided a detailed list of gametes and a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me see:\n\nGametes: CB (from Parent 1), cb (from Parent 2)\nPunnett square:\n- CB x CB: CC BB (checkered red)\n- CB x cb: CcBb (checkered brown)\n- cb x CB: CcBb (checkered brown)\n- cb x cb: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb and cc bb, with the phenotypes as described. But the question is about F2, so perhaps the user mistakenly wrote F1 instead of F2 in the instructions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different calculation.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is considering the dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, treating the two genes as linked, but that complicates the ratios significantly beyond simple 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that none of the options match the 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Option C is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio will be 1:1:1:1 for each of the four possible combinations. But wait, that might not be accurate because some combinations could lead to the same phenotype depending on dominance. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (i.e., C is present), it shows red pigment.\n- If it has no C alleles (i.e., c is present), it shows plain.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (i.e., B is present), it shows brown.\n- If it has no B alleles, it shows checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are the combinations of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, considering the inheritance patterns, each gene is independently assorting, so the combination of these traits can be represented as 25% for each phenotype. However, wait, that might not account for all cases properly. Let me consider the possible gametes and their contributions:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb gametes (both recessive).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb, each occurring 50% of the time. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (all C and all B)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (half of the time)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (another half)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (all c and all b)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the F1 itself is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CcBb (50%)\n3. cc bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the F1 is CcBb, which upon selfing would produce a certain distribution. Actually, the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities of each genotype in F2:\n\nThe parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each with 50% probability. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain checkered: 25%\n\nThis would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes. But looking back at the options given, none of them match this exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will show red pigment.\n- B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will show brown color.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are indeed as I listed earlier. But none of the options provided have equal ratios. Wait, let me look again at the options:\n\nOptions A through H don't have equal ratios. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which seems too high for a 4-proportional system. Similarly, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, adding to 12. Option G has 12,2,2,0, totaling 16. Maybe I've misunderstood the problem's context.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2.

Wait, the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (B absent) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% for each.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: Checkered red, Plain red, Checkered brown, Plain brown.\n\nNext, calculate the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we can use a Punnett square where each parent (F1) is crossed with itself (to get F2). The F1 is CcBb.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so we'll look at each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nLet's consider each gene individually:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - Probability of pigment red (C present) = 3/4 (since C can be CC, Cc, or Cc from the F1)\n  - Probability of plain (c) = 1/4\n  \n- For the body color (B):\n  - Probability of brown (B present) = 3/4\n  - Probability of checkered (b) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Both traits dominant (Red and Brown): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment dominant, body recessive (Red and Checkered): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain, Pigment dominant (Checkered, Brown): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Both recessive (Plain, Checkered): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 1.

Correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide different ratios. Let me see:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 That sums to 16, but the actual probabilities are 9,3,3,1.\n\nLooking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This seems inverted.

My calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Let me review my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes differently. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe bird's phenotype depends on both traits. If both traits are dominant, it's Checkered red. Otherwise, it's the phenotype corresponding to the recessive trait. For example, if pigment is recessive (plain), regardless of body color, it's Plain red. Similarly, if body color is recessive (checkered), regardless of pigment, it's Checkered brown.\n\nIn my earlier analysis, I considered all four combinations correctly. So why aren't any of the options matching?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1.

Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and checkered (C and b) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Plain and checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut then the sum is 9+3+3+1 =16 parts, which adds up correctly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.

Wait, no\u2014my earlier assignment was:\n\nCheckered red (A) = 9/16\n\nCheckered brown (B) = 3/16\n\nPlain red (C) = 9/16\n\nPlain brown (D) = 3/16\n\nSo the order given in option K is 1,3,9,3, which would correspond to D, B, A, C. Which makes sense because D comes before B in terms of the checkered phenotype appearing less frequently than the plain. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how the options are structured. If the options list the phenotypes in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then the correct ratio is 9:3:9:3, which is option K. Yes, because 9 (A) + 3 (B) = 12, and 9 (C) + 3 (D) = 12, totaling 24. Wait, no, that's not adding up. Wait, 9+3+9+3=24, which is incorrect because the total should be 16. I must have made a mistake in the calculations. Wait, let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has two outcomes, so the combined phenotypes are four possibilities:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n1. A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n\n- Plain red: 3/16\n\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich translates to counts proportional to 9,3,3,1. So looking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align because 12+2+2+0=16, which fits the denominator, but the numerators don't match. Option K is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't fit because the numbers don't add up properly. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant): 3/4 (since it's recessive)\n- c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B (dominant): 3/4\n- b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Now, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\n1. A: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. D: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to option G, where the ratio is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, but according to our calculation, the checkered red (phenotype C) is 3/16, plain red (phenotype A) is 9/16, checkered brown (phenotype D) is 1/16, and plain brown (phenotype B) is 3/16. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, no. I might have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and checkered (C and b) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Plain and checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut then the sum is 9+3+3+1 =16 parts, which adds up correctly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because according to my calculation, checkered red is 9/16, checkered brown is 3/16, plain red is 9/16, plain brown is 3/16. None of the options match exactly except perhaps if I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nYes, that seems right.

If the options list the phenotypes in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then the correct ratio is 9:3:9:3, which is option K.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "For the C locus, since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will express the red pigment.",
    "rollout": " For the C locus, since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will express the red pigment. Similarly, for B, any bird with at least one B allele will express the brown color. Now, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C (i.e., C_: Cc or CC) = 3/4\nBecause the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). So C_ is 75%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one B (i.e., B_: BB or Bb) = 3/4\nSimilarly, the possible genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So B_ is 75%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C_ and B_ present.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_ (3/4) and bb (1/4)\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown: cc (1/4) and B_ (3/4)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered: cc (1/4) and bb (1/4)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. Now, looking at the options given:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our calculation. Our calculations show 9/16 for checkered red (which includes both checkered red and checkered brown?), but according to our breakdown, each phenotype corresponds directly to the combination of the two traits. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014each phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nBut in terms of the options given, option D lists:\n\n- Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that seems like it's summing up the probabilities incorrectly. Because the checkered red should include both checkered red and checkered brown. According to our earlier analysis, checkered red is when the bird is plain (c) but has brown (B) pigment, which happens when cB is present. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio is 9 (for C_ B_), 3 (C_ bb), 3 (cc B_), and 1 (cc bb).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Option J lists 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option D lists 1,3,9,3, which matches exactly what I've got except for the order. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Yes, that matches.\n\nBut wait, in my calculation, the checkered red is 3/16, which is 3 parts, and checkered brown is 3/16, totaling 6/16. The plain red is 9/16, and plain brown is 1/16. So the order in the options is different. Option D lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So yes, that's matching.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it: the phenotypic ratio could be represented as 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Pigment red and brown (C_ B_)\n- 3: Pigment red and checkered (C_ bb)\n- 3: Plain and brown (cc B_)\n- 1: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each F1 bird contributes either CB or cb gametes. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Brown (b) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc: Plain (c_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain and brown\n- bb: Plain (c_), Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25% (CC)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain and brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain and checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Oh! Wait, no\u2014if each gene is considered separately, then for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red is present if C is present (C_ or CC)\n- Plain is absent if c is present (cc)\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Brown is present if B is present (B_ or BB)\n- Checkered is absent if b is present (bb)\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C_ (pigment red) AND B_ (body brown) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_ (pigment red) AND bb (body checkered) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown: cc (body plain) AND B_ (pigment brown) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered: cc (body plain) AND bb (pigment checkered) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo converting these percentages to whole numbers (assuming 100 individuals):\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 56.25% \u2192 56.25 \u00d7 100 \u2248 56.25 \u2192 approx 56\n- Pigment red and checkered: 18.75% \u2192 ~19\n- Plain and brown: 18.75% \u2192 ~19\n- Plain and checkered: 6.25% \u2192 ~6\n\nAdding them up: 56 + 19 + 19 + 6 = 100.\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this exact distribution. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is less than 100. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D lists: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding those together gives 1+3+9+3=16, which is much lower than 100. That suggests that this might not be the correct approach, or perhaps I misunderstood how the phenotypes are defined.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe \"checkered\" refers only to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers only to the C locus. In that case, the phenotypes would be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ (C dominant) and B_ \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ and bb \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: cc (C recessive) and B_ \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: cc and bb \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAgain, same result as before. None of the options provided match this exact distribution. Perhaps the options are scaled differently or rounded. Let's see the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nEtc. All options add up to 16. That suggests that perhaps the options are presenting the count without scaling, or perhaps they represent something else.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options don't seem to reflect the correct 56:19:19:6 ratio. However, perhaps the correct answer is among the choices, and I need to identify which one aligns best, even if it's not the precise percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the probabilities. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: C_ (pigment red) is dominant, so probability is 3/4\n- B: B_ (body brown) is dominant, so probability is 3/4\n\nCombined, each phenotype has a probability of (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for checkered red and brown, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for checkered red and checkered, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for plain red and brown, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for plain red and checkered.\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which is not listed in the options. Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but that's not matching either. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but that's the reverse of the actual ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a different order. Let me look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. If we consider that the order is [C_ B_], [C_ bb], [cc B_], [cc bb], then the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options list the counts in a different order, which may cause confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the number of each phenotype counted regardless of the order, leading to 1 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 16, which does not correspond to the correct ratio. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended correct answer is Option D, as it represents the highest counts for the most probable phenotypes, even though the exact percentages do not match. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance relationships.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the C locus. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (body brown) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: cc (body plain) and B_ (pigment brown) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: cc (body plain) and bb (pigment checkered) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nStill, the ratio is 56:19:19:6, which isn't reflected in the options. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected ratio. However, looking closely at the options provided, option D presents a ratio that sums to 16 (1+3+9+3=16), while the correct sum should be 16 (total population). But the correct ratio should be 56:19:19:6, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is Option D, assuming some rounding or approximation was done, even though it's not mathematically accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Let me confirm:\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, when two genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio depends on the genetic distances, but since the question states that the animals are controlled by a dominant gene C and a recessive gene c, it implies that C and c are on separate chromosomes and assort independently. Therefore, the dominance hierarchy applies to each gene independently, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the options provided don't include this. However, if we adjust the options to match the closest, perhaps option D is intended. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the count of each phenotype without considering dominance, treating all heterozygotes as the same phenotype, but that wouldn't apply here.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation in this scenario is indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the counts 9, 3, 3, 1 for the four phenotypes respectively. However, the options provided do not include this exact sequence. Among the options, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. But if we consider that the question expects the order to be [C_ B_], [C_ bb], [cc B_], [cc bb], then option D is correct, despite being in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option D is the closest match, albeit with a discrepancy in the order.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this, I must reconsider. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Let me reevaluate the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 bird is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 produces Cc and bb gametes (since C is dominant and B is dominant). When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 Cc: 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 bb: 25% bbBb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether C is present and B is present. Let's compute the phenotypic ratio:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Genotypes CC, CcBb, CcBb, ccBb \u2192 Total: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% (but wait, no\u2014CC is 25%, CcBb is 25%, and ccBb is 25%, so 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%) \u2192 Phenotype 1: 75%\n\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Only CcBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25%\n\n- Phenotype 3: Plain (C absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 Only ccBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 25%\n\n- Phenotype 4: Plain (C absent) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Only bbBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nWait, that's conflicting with earlier conclusions. Earlier, I thought each gene had 75% for presence, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but now this approach shows that the phenotypic ratio is 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't make sense because the presence of one gene affects the other. Wait, I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nActually, the presence of C and B are independent, so the phenotypic ratio should be (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 for Pigment red and brown, (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 for Pigment red and checkered, (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 for Plain and brown, and (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 for Plain and checkered. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with the initial calculation.\n\nGiven this, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, looking back at the options,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. For the C locus, since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will express the red pigment. Similarly, for B, any bird with at least one B allele will express the brown color. Now, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C (i.e., C_: Cc or CC) = 3/4\nBecause the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). So C_ is 75%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of having at least one B (i.e., B_: BB or Bb) = 3/4\nSimilarly, the possible genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So B_ is 75%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C_ and B_ present.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_ (3/4) and bb (1/4)\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown: cc (1/4) and B_ (3/4)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered: cc (1/4) and bb (1/4)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. Now, looking at the options given:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our calculation. Our calculations show 9/16 for checkered red (which includes both checkered red and checkered brown?), but according to our breakdown, each phenotype corresponds directly to the combination of the two traits. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014each phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nBut in terms of the options given, option D lists:\n\n- Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that seems like it's summing up the probabilities incorrectly. Because the checkered red should include both checkered red and checkered brown. According to our earlier analysis, checkered red is when the bird is plain (c) but has brown (B) pigment, which happens when cB is present. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio is 9 (for C_ B_), 3 (C_ bb), 3 (cc B_), and 1 (cc bb).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Option J lists 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option D lists 1,3,9,3, which matches exactly what I've got except for the order. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Yes, that matches.\n\nBut wait, in my calculation, the checkered red is 3/16, which is 3 parts, and checkered brown is 3/16, totaling 6/16. The plain red is 9/16, and plain brown is 1/16. So the order in the options is different. Option D lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So yes, that's matching.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it: the phenotypic ratio could be represented as 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Pigment red and brown (C_ B_)\n- 3: Pigment red and checkered (C_ bb)\n- 3: Plain and brown (cc B_)\n- 1: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option D.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each F1 bird contributes either CB or cb gametes. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Brown (b) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc: Plain (c_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain and brown\n- bb: Plain (c_), Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25% (CC)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain and brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain and checkered: 25% (bb)\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Oh! Wait, no\u2014if each gene is considered separately, then for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red is present if C is present (C_ or CC)\n- Plain is absent if c is present (cc)\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Brown is present if B is present (B_ or BB)\n- Checkered is absent if b is present (bb)\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C_ (pigment red) AND B_ (body brown) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_ (pigment red) AND bb (body checkered) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown: cc (body plain) AND B_ (pigment brown) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered: cc (body plain) AND bb (pigment checkered) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo converting these percentages to whole numbers (assuming 100 individuals):\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 56.25% \u2192 56.25 \u00d7 100 \u2248 56.25 \u2192 approx 56\n- Pigment red and checkered: 18.75% \u2192 ~19\n- Plain and brown: 18.75% \u2192 ~19\n- Plain and checkered: 6.25% \u2192 ~6\n\nAdding them up: 56 + 19 + 19 + 6 = 100.\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this exact distribution. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is less than 100. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption D lists: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding those together gives 1+3+9+3=16, which is much lower than 100. That suggests that this might not be the correct approach, or perhaps I misunderstood how the phenotypes are defined.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe \"checkered\" refers only to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers only to the C locus. In that case, the phenotypes would be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ (C dominant) and B_ \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ and bb \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: cc (C recessive) and B_ \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: cc and bb \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAgain, same result as before. None of the options provided match this exact distribution. Perhaps the options are scaled differently or rounded. Let's see the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nEtc. All options add up to 16. That suggests that perhaps the options are presenting the count without scaling, or perhaps they represent something else.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options don't seem to reflect the correct 56:19:19:6 ratio. However, perhaps the correct answer is among the choices, and I need to identify which one aligns best, even if it's not the precise percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the probabilities. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: C_ (pigment red) is dominant, so probability is 3/4\n- B: B_ (body brown) is dominant, so probability is 3/4\n\nCombined, each phenotype has a probability of (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for checkered red and brown, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for checkered red and checkered, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for plain red and brown, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for plain red and checkered.\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which is not listed in the options. Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but that's not matching either. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but that's the reverse of the actual ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented in a different order. Let me look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. If we consider that the order is [C_ B_], [C_ bb], [cc B_], [cc bb], then the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options list the counts in a different order, which may cause confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the number of each phenotype counted regardless of the order, leading to 1 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 16, which does not correspond to the correct ratio. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended correct answer is Option D, as it represents the highest counts for the most probable phenotypes, even though the exact percentages do not match. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance relationships.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the C locus. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (body brown) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: cc (body plain) and B_ (pigment brown) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: cc (body plain) and bb (pigment checkered) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nStill, the ratio is 56:19:19:6, which isn't reflected in the options. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected ratio. However, looking closely at the options provided, option D presents a ratio that sums to 16 (1+3+9+3=16), while the correct sum should be 16 (total population). But the correct ratio should be 56:19:19:6, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is Option D, assuming some rounding or approximation was done, even though it's not mathematically accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Let me confirm:\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, when two genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio depends on the genetic distances, but since the question states that the animals are controlled by a dominant gene C and a recessive gene c, it implies that C and c are on separate chromosomes and assort independently. Therefore, the dominance hierarchy applies to each gene independently, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the options provided don't include this. However, if we adjust the options to match the closest, perhaps option D is intended. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the count of each phenotype without considering dominance, treating all heterozygotes as the same phenotype, but that wouldn't apply here.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation in this scenario is indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the counts 9, 3, 3, 1 for the four phenotypes respectively. However, the options provided do not include this exact sequence. Among the options, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. But if we consider that the question expects the order to be [C_ B_], [C_ bb], [cc B_], [cc bb], then option D is correct, despite being in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option D is the closest match, albeit with a discrepancy in the order.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match this, I must reconsider. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Let me reevaluate the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 bird is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 produces Cc and bb gametes (since C is dominant and B is dominant). When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Cc \u00d7 bb: 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 Cc: 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 bb: 25% bbBb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether C is present and B is present. Let's compute the phenotypic ratio:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Genotypes CC, CcBb, CcBb, ccBb \u2192 Total: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% (but wait, no\u2014CC is 25%, CcBb is 25%, and ccBb is 25%, so 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%) \u2192 Phenotype 1: 75%\n\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Only CcBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25%\n\n- Phenotype 3: Plain (C absent) and brown (B present) \u2192 Only ccBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 25%\n\n- Phenotype 4: Plain (C absent) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Only bbBb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nWait, that's conflicting with earlier conclusions. Earlier, I thought each gene had 75% for presence, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but now this approach shows that the phenotypic ratio is 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1, but that doesn't make sense because the presence of one gene affects the other. Wait, I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nActually, the presence of C and B are independent, so the phenotypic ratio should be (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 for Pigment red and brown, (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 for Pigment red and checkered, (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 for Plain and brown, and (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 for Plain and checkered. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with the initial calculation.\n\nGiven this, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, looking back at the options,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me approach this methodically.",
    "rollout": " Let me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, for the pigment color (C):\n- C is dominant: red\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nSecond, for the body color (B):\n- B is dominant: brown\n- b is recessive: checkered\n\nSince the two genes determine different aspects of the same bird, they are independent. Therefore, the phenotypes will follow a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined, the overall phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for two genes each determining two traits. In our case, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of the two traits. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant): PhenoRatio 9\nWait, no, that's not right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio for each trait is 3:1, but together, the phenotypic ratio combines them into a 9:3:3:1 distribution. However, in this case, since both traits are expressed, the overall phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but I think that might not apply directly here because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio would reflect the combination of both. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the possible phenotypes for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Pigment Color:\n- Red (C present)\n- Plain (c recessive)\n\nFor Body Color:\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe phenotypic combinations are:\n1. Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach combination can occur independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but when combined, the overall phenotypic ratio depends on how often each combination occurs. However, since the two traits are determined by independent genes, the number of each combination will be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each trait occurring. \n\nSo, for each trait, the probability is 3/4 for the dominant (since 3/4 have C or B dominant) and 1/4 for the recessive (c or b). Since the traits are independent, the combined probability for any specific combination is (probability of pigment color) * (probability of body color). \n\nLet's calculate the probability for each phenotypic combination:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C and B dominant):\n   - Probability of Pigment Red = 3/4\n   - Probability of Body Brown = 3/4\n   - Combined probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n   - Probability of Pigment Red = 3/4\n   - Probability of Body Checkered = 1/4\n   - Combined probability = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and Brown (c recessive, B dominant):\n   - Probability of Plain = 1/4\n   - Probability of Body Brown = 3/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (c recessive, B recessive):\n   - Probability of Plain = 1/4\n   - Probability of Checkered = 1/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into actual counts, depending on the population size. However, looking at the options provided, the answer choices seem to mix phenotypic ratios with genotype frequencies. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, along with genotype frequencies and phenotypic ratios for F2. Looking back at the options, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match my previous calculation of 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let me clarify the phenotypes again. The bird colors are determined by two genes: C/B for pigment and B/b for body color. So the possible phenotypes based on the combination are:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): This bird would appear red and brown.\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): This bird would appear red and checkered.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): This bird would appear plain and brown.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): This bird would appear plain and checkered.\n\nNow, the question provides options where the phenotypic ratio is given in numbers like checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. So perhaps the way the phenotypes are being counted isn't exactly matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but rather grouped differently. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems off because according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, checkered red and checkered brown should be 3:3, while plain red and plain brown should also be 3:3. Option G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because 12+2+2=16, leaving zero for checkered brown. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. But according to our 9:3:3:1, checkered red and checkered brown should be 3:3. So perhaps the question is grouping the checkered phenotypes as one category and plain as another. If that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio could be 6:2 for checkered and 2:4 for plain, but that's not what the options show. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type within the checkered and plain groups, regardless of the order. Let me look at option E: 3,9,1,3. Adding those gives 16, which matches the possible population size. So in this case, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3. But none of the options directly say that. Wait, looking back at the options, option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That fits a 3:9:1:3 ratio. However, the question specifies the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation, which may include both checkered and plain as separate categories. So option E seems plausible. Let me verify the calculations again. Wait, earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, but the options don't align with that. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. The dominant alleles are C for pigment and B for body color. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will display the corresponding color. Therefore, the phenotypic categories remain as before. So, the ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly state this. Option E lists 3:9:1:3, which is a mirror of the 9:3:3:1 ratio, showing checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. This makes sense because the checkered phenotype includes both checkered red and checkered brown, while plain includes plain red and plain brown. So, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so among the options, option E presents the ratio as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16. This matches our expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, for the pigment color (C):\n- C is dominant: red\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nSecond, for the body color (B):\n- B is dominant: brown\n- b is recessive: checkered\n\nSince the two genes determine different aspects of the same bird, they are independent. Therefore, the phenotypes will follow a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined, the overall phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for two genes each determining two traits. In our case, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of the two traits. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant): PhenoRatio 9\nWait, no, that's not right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio for each trait is 3:1, but together, the phenotypic ratio combines them into a 9:3:3:1 distribution. However, in this case, since both traits are expressed, the overall phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but I think that might not apply directly here because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio would reflect the combination of both. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the possible phenotypes for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Pigment Color:\n- Red (C present)\n- Plain (c recessive)\n\nFor Body Color:\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe phenotypic combinations are:\n1. Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach combination can occur independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but when combined, the overall phenotypic ratio depends on how often each combination occurs. However, since the two traits are determined by independent genes, the number of each combination will be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each trait occurring. \n\nSo, for each trait, the probability is 3/4 for the dominant (since 3/4 have C or B dominant) and 1/4 for the recessive (c or b). Since the traits are independent, the combined probability for any specific combination is (probability of pigment color) * (probability of body color). \n\nLet's calculate the probability for each phenotypic combination:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C and B dominant):\n   - Probability of Pigment Red = 3/4\n   - Probability of Body Brown = 3/4\n   - Combined probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n   - Probability of Pigment Red = 3/4\n   - Probability of Body Checkered = 1/4\n   - Combined probability = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and Brown (c recessive, B dominant):\n   - Probability of Plain = 1/4\n   - Probability of Body Brown = 3/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (c recessive, B recessive):\n   - Probability of Plain = 1/4\n   - Probability of Checkered = 1/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into actual counts, depending on the population size. However, looking at the options provided, the answer choices seem to mix phenotypic ratios with genotype frequencies. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, along with genotype frequencies and phenotypic ratios for F2. Looking back at the options, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match my previous calculation of 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let me clarify the phenotypes again. The bird colors are determined by two genes: C/B for pigment and B/b for body color. So the possible phenotypes based on the combination are:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): This bird would appear red and brown.\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): This bird would appear red and checkered.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): This bird would appear plain and brown.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): This bird would appear plain and checkered.\n\nNow, the question provides options where the phenotypic ratio is given in numbers like checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. So perhaps the way the phenotypes are being counted isn't exactly matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but rather grouped differently. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems off because according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, checkered red and checkered brown should be 3:3, while plain red and plain brown should also be 3:3. Option G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because 12+2+2=16, leaving zero for checkered brown. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. But according to our 9:3:3:1, checkered red and checkered brown should be 3:3. So perhaps the question is grouping the checkered phenotypes as one category and plain as another. If that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio could be 6:2 for checkered and 2:4 for plain, but that's not what the options show. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type within the checkered and plain groups, regardless of the order. Let me look at option E: 3,9,1,3. Adding those gives 16, which matches the possible population size. So in this case, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3. But none of the options directly say that. Wait, looking back at the options, option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That fits a 3:9:1:3 ratio. However, the question specifies the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation, which may include both checkered and plain as separate categories. So option E seems plausible. Let me verify the calculations again. Wait, earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, but the options don't align with that. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. The dominant alleles are C for pigment and B for body color. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will display the corresponding color. Therefore, the phenotypic categories remain as before. So, the ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly state this. Option E lists 3:9:1:3, which is a mirror of the 9:3:3:1 ratio, showing checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. This makes sense because the checkered phenotype includes both checkered red and checkered brown, while plain includes plain red and plain brown. So, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so among the options, option E presents the ratio as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16. This matches our expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Now, looking back at the options given, the possible answers involve different ratios.",
    "rollout": " Now, looking back at the options given, the possible answers involve different ratios. The user wants us to determine which option is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should use a Punnett square approach. Let me try constructing it properly. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant)\n- 25% Cc (heterozygous dominant)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut to get the phenotypes, we consider the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment color (C):\n\n- If C is present (either dominant in CC or Cc), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (in cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either dominant in Cc or BB), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (only in bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Now, for each bird in F2:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - Present: red\n  - Absent: plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - Present: brown\n  - Absent: checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to see how many birds have each combination. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (homozygous red): Both C alleles are present, so red. Also, B is present (B from CC), so brown. So phenotype: red-brown.\n2. Cc (heterozygous red): C is present, B is present \u2192 red-brown.\n3. cc (homozygous plain): Both c alleles are present, so plain. Also, B is present \u2192 brown. So phenotype: plain-brown.\n4. bb (homozygous plain): Both b alleles are present, so plain. B is absent \u2192 checkered. So phenotype: plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- red-brown: 25%\n- plain-brown: 25%\n- plain-checkered: 25%\n- red-checkered: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red-brown : 25% plain-brown : 25% plain-checkered : 25% red-checkered. But none of the answer choices seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum = 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum = 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum = 16\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum = 16\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum = 16\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\n\nWait, all options add up to 16, but the actual expected is 100%, so perhaps some are miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio without considering dominance or something else. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the setup or the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by recessive allele b. So the phenotypes depend on both genes. Perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of checkered versus plain, and similarly for brown vs. red, but that doesn't align with the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of checkered and plain within each color category, but the way the options are structured suggests that the sums don't add up to 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the F2 generation with the numbers given, but scaled down. Let me re-examine the initial setup. The user mentions \"the expected phenotypic ratio\" and provides several options. Let me think differently: perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is generated by selfing F1. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%). Therefore, F2 would have 25% CB+CB (CC BB), 25% CB+cb (CcBb), 25% cb+CB (CcBb), and 25% cb+cb (cc BB). Wait, but according to the user's initial data, the F2 genotypes listed are:\n\n- CB (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- cb (from CB gamete + cb gamete)\n- cB (from cb gamete + CB gamete)\n- cb (from cb gamete + cb gamete)\n\nBut that seems redundant because CB and cb are the same as cB and cb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how the gametes combine. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the notation. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 can be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (B) BB (b)\nWait, no, the F2 would be:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete, which combines to give the F2 genotype. So:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: CB \u2192 F2 genotype: CC (from C) and BB (from B) \u2192 CC BB\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb \u2192 F2 genotype: CC (from C) and bB (from B?) Wait, no\u2014gamete 2's B allele comes from the parent, which is B (since the parent is CcBB). Wait, confusion arises here. Let me structure it correctly.\n\nParent 1: CcBB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: ccbb (homozygous recessive)\n\nEach parent can only produce gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 can only give CB gametes, while Parent 2 can only give cb gametes. So F1 is CcBb. F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB (from Parent 1 gamete CB) + CB (from Parent 2 gamete CB) \u2192 Cc + Bb \u2192 CC BB (phenotype: red brown)\n- CB (from Parent 1) + cb (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc + Bb \u2192 CC Bb (phenotype: red brown)\n- cb (from Parent 2) + CB (from Parent 1) \u2192 cc + Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype: plain brown)\n- cb (from Parent 2) + cb (from Parent 2) \u2192 cc + bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype: plain plain)\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 should have four distinct genotypes with certain probabilities. However, due to independent assortment, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene:\n\n- C: 50% chance to be present (C) or not (c)\n- B: 50% chance to be present (B) or not (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (probability of C being present) * (probability of B being present).\n\nThus, the four possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 (C present) * (B present) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n2. CC Bb \u2192 (C present) * (B absent) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n3. cc BB \u2192 (c present) * (B present) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n4. cc Bb \u2192 (c present) * (B absent) \u2192 0.25 or 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency, except that some may overlap in terms of phenotype grouping. However, in terms of phenotypic ratio, each of the four genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red brown : 25% plain brown : 25% red plain : 25% brown plain. But looking at the answer options, they don't include such a breakdown. Instead, they group checkered and plain together, and red and brown together. Wait, perhaps the user is interested in comparing checkered and plain within each color category, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to compare the phenotypes where checkered and plain are grouped, and red and brown are grouped. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: plain red (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain: red brown (CC BB, CC Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Checkered: plain brown (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain: brown (red brown) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nBut then, the overall checkered to plain ratio would be 50% : 50%, regardless of color. That doesn't make sense because the phenotypes would be split evenly between checkered/plain and red/brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the proportion of checkered birds among red and brown birds, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the number of checkered and plain birds regardless of color. Alternatively, perhaps the user is making a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the setup. The user provided the following gametes for F1: CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2). Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are described. Let me recount the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (red brown)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (red brown)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (red brown)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain plain)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- red brown: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- red brown: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- red brown: 25% (from cb + CB)\n- plain plain: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nBut in reality, these are four separate phenotypes, each 25% of the population. However, the user might be aggregating them into two categories: checkered and plain, and red and brown. So, for the checkered/plain aspect:\n\n- Checkered: plain red (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered: plain brown (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\nWait, no\u2014that's double-counting. Actually, in F2, the checkered phenotype would come from:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\nAnd the non-checkered (red and brown) would be:\n\n- CC BB (red brown)\n- CC Bb (red brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. CC Bb (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nBut in terms of checkered and plain, the checkered phenotype includes:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\n\nWhich is 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% of the population.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The F2 population consists of four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. CC Bb (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the B locus (b), meaning:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nTherefore, the proportion of checkered (including plain) is 3/4 (75%) of the population, and the remaining 25% are non-checkered (red and brown). Similarly, the red and brown phenotype would be the presence of the dominant B allele (B):\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no, that's overlapping. Let me list all four phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each at 25% frequency. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of \"checkered.\" Checkered usually refers to having the recessive allele at one locus and dominant at another, i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, etc. So perhaps the user is referring to any bird that is not displaying checkered coloration, meaning they have at least one dominant allele.\n\nIf that's the case, then the checkered phenotype would include:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\n\nWhich is 75% of the population. The red and brown phenotype would be:\n\n- CC BB (red brown)\n- CC Bb (red brown)\n- cc BB (plain brown)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, that still totals 100%. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the initial question. The user asks for the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Based on standard terminology, \"checkered\" refers to the lack of checkering, i.e., the presence of the recessive allele at one locus and dominant at another. So, in this context, checkered would mean:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nAnd non-checkered would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Non-checkered would be those who do not exhibit checkered, meaning they have at least one dominant allele. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the non-checkered phenotype is red and brown, and checkered is plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3 for checkered (plain) to non-checkered (red and brown). But looking at the options, none of them seem to reflect that directly. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering only the presence of the B allele, leading to:\n\n- B present (B) \u2192 red\n- B absent (b) \u2192 brown\n\nCombined with C present (C) or not (c):\n\n- B present and C present \u2192 red-brown\n- B present and C absent \u2192 red-brown\n- B absent and C present \u2192 red-brown\n- B absent and C absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- C present (C) and B present (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 red-brown\n- C absent and B present \u2192 red-brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, that would imply that 75% of the population is red-brown, and 25% are plain plain. But that contradicts the user's earlier analysis. I think I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me try to calculate the expected phenotypic counts based on the F2 genotypes. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (phenotype: red-brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (phenotype: red-brown)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (phenotype: plain-brown)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (phenotype: plain-brown)\n\nAdditionally, the F2 could also have other genotypes like CB and cb, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the only possible F2 genotypes are the ones already listed. So, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- red-brown: 50% (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- plain-brown: 50% (from cc BB and cc Bb)\n- red-brown: 50% (from CB + CB and CB + cb)\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Now, looking back at the options given, the possible answers involve different ratios. The user wants us to determine which option is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should use a Punnett square approach. Let me try constructing it properly. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant)\n- 25% Cc (heterozygous dominant)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut to get the phenotypes, we consider the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment color (C):\n\n- If C is present (either dominant in CC or Cc), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (in cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either dominant in Cc or BB), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (only in bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Now, for each bird in F2:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - Present: red\n  - Absent: plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - Present: brown\n  - Absent: checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to see how many birds have each combination. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (homozygous red): Both C alleles are present, so red. Also, B is present (B from CC), so brown. So phenotype: red-brown.\n2. Cc (heterozygous red): C is present, B is present \u2192 red-brown.\n3. cc (homozygous plain): Both c alleles are present, so plain. Also, B is present \u2192 brown. So phenotype: plain-brown.\n4. bb (homozygous plain): Both b alleles are present, so plain. B is absent \u2192 checkered. So phenotype: plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- red-brown: 25%\n- plain-brown: 25%\n- plain-checkered: 25%\n- red-checkered: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red-brown : 25% plain-brown : 25% plain-checkered : 25% red-checkered. But none of the answer choices seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum = 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum = 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum = 16\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum = 16\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum = 16\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum = 16\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum = 16\n\nWait, all options add up to 16, but the actual expected is 100%, so perhaps some are miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio without considering dominance or something else. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the setup or the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by recessive allele b. So the phenotypes depend on both genes. Perhaps the user intended to ask about the ratio of checkered versus plain, and similarly for brown vs. red, but that doesn't align with the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of checkered and plain within each color category, but the way the options are structured suggests that the sums don't add up to 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the F2 generation with the numbers given, but scaled down. Let me re-examine the initial setup. The user mentions \"the expected phenotypic ratio\" and provides several options. Let me think differently: perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is generated by selfing F1. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%). Therefore, F2 would have 25% CB+CB (CC BB), 25% CB+cb (CcBb), 25% cb+CB (CcBb), and 25% cb+cb (cc BB). Wait, but according to the user's initial data, the F2 genotypes listed are:\n\n- CB (from CB gamete + CB gamete)\n- cb (from CB gamete + cb gamete)\n- cB (from cb gamete + CB gamete)\n- cb (from cb gamete + cb gamete)\n\nBut that seems redundant because CB and cb are the same as cB and cb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how the gametes combine. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the notation. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 can be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (B) BB (b)\nWait, no, the F2 would be:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete, which combines to give the F2 genotype. So:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: CB \u2192 F2 genotype: CC (from C) and BB (from B) \u2192 CC BB\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb \u2192 F2 genotype: CC (from C) and bB (from B?) Wait, no\u2014gamete 2's B allele comes from the parent, which is B (since the parent is CcBB). Wait, confusion arises here. Let me structure it correctly.\n\nParent 1: CcBB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: ccbb (homozygous recessive)\n\nEach parent can only produce gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 can only give CB gametes, while Parent 2 can only give cb gametes. So F1 is CcBb. F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB (from Parent 1 gamete CB) + CB (from Parent 2 gamete CB) \u2192 Cc + Bb \u2192 CC BB (phenotype: red brown)\n- CB (from Parent 1) + cb (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc + Bb \u2192 CC Bb (phenotype: red brown)\n- cb (from Parent 2) + CB (from Parent 1) \u2192 cc + Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype: plain brown)\n- cb (from Parent 2) + cb (from Parent 2) \u2192 cc + bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype: plain plain)\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 should have four distinct genotypes with certain probabilities. However, due to independent assortment, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene:\n\n- C: 50% chance to be present (C) or not (c)\n- B: 50% chance to be present (B) or not (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (probability of C being present) * (probability of B being present).\n\nThus, the four possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 (C present) * (B present) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n2. CC Bb \u2192 (C present) * (B absent) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n3. cc BB \u2192 (c present) * (B present) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n4. cc Bb \u2192 (c present) * (B absent) \u2192 0.25 or 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency, except that some may overlap in terms of phenotype grouping. However, in terms of phenotypic ratio, each of the four genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red brown : 25% plain brown : 25% red plain : 25% brown plain. But looking at the answer options, they don't include such a breakdown. Instead, they group checkered and plain together, and red and brown together. Wait, perhaps the user is interested in comparing checkered and plain within each color category, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to compare the phenotypes where checkered and plain are grouped, and red and brown are grouped. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: plain red (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain: red brown (CC BB, CC Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Checkered: plain brown (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain: brown (red brown) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nBut then, the overall checkered to plain ratio would be 50% : 50%, regardless of color. That doesn't make sense because the phenotypes would be split evenly between checkered/plain and red/brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the proportion of checkered birds among red and brown birds, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the number of checkered and plain birds regardless of color. Alternatively, perhaps the user is making a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the setup. The user provided the following gametes for F1: CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2). Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are described. Let me recount the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (red brown)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (red brown)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (red brown)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain plain)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- red brown: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- red brown: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- red brown: 25% (from cb + CB)\n- plain plain: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nBut in reality, these are four separate phenotypes, each 25% of the population. However, the user might be aggregating them into two categories: checkered and plain, and red and brown. So, for the checkered/plain aspect:\n\n- Checkered: plain red (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered: plain brown (cc BB and cc Bb) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\nWait, no\u2014that's double-counting. Actually, in F2, the checkered phenotype would come from:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\nAnd the non-checkered (red and brown) would be:\n\n- CC BB (red brown)\n- CC Bb (red brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. CC Bb (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nBut in terms of checkered and plain, the checkered phenotype includes:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\n\nWhich is 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% of the population.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The F2 population consists of four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red brown)\n2. CC Bb (red brown)\n3. cc BB (plain brown)\n4. cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the B locus (b), meaning:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nTherefore, the proportion of checkered (including plain) is 3/4 (75%) of the population, and the remaining 25% are non-checkered (red and brown). Similarly, the red and brown phenotype would be the presence of the dominant B allele (B):\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no, that's overlapping. Let me list all four phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each at 25% frequency. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of \"checkered.\" Checkered usually refers to having the recessive allele at one locus and dominant at another, i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, etc. So perhaps the user is referring to any bird that is not displaying checkered coloration, meaning they have at least one dominant allele.\n\nIf that's the case, then the checkered phenotype would include:\n\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain plain)\n\nWhich is 75% of the population. The red and brown phenotype would be:\n\n- CC BB (red brown)\n- CC Bb (red brown)\n- cc BB (plain brown)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, that still totals 100%. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the initial question. The user asks for the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Based on standard terminology, \"checkered\" refers to the lack of checkering, i.e., the presence of the recessive allele at one locus and dominant at another. So, in this context, checkered would mean:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain plain\n\nAnd non-checkered would be:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Non-checkered would be those who do not exhibit checkered, meaning they have at least one dominant allele. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the non-checkered phenotype is red and brown, and checkered is plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3 for checkered (plain) to non-checkered (red and brown). But looking at the options, none of them seem to reflect that directly. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering only the presence of the B allele, leading to:\n\n- B present (B) \u2192 red\n- B absent (b) \u2192 brown\n\nCombined with C present (C) or not (c):\n\n- B present and C present \u2192 red-brown\n- B present and C absent \u2192 red-brown\n- B absent and C present \u2192 red-brown\n- B absent and C absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- C present (C) and B present (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 red-brown\n- C absent and B present \u2192 red-brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, that would imply that 75% of the population is red-brown, and 25% are plain plain. But that contradicts the user's earlier analysis. I think I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me try to calculate the expected phenotypic counts based on the F2 genotypes. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (phenotype: red-brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (phenotype: red-brown)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (phenotype: plain-brown)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (phenotype: plain-brown)\n\nAdditionally, the F2 could also have other genotypes like CB and cb, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the only possible F2 genotypes are the ones already listed. So, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- red-brown: 50% (from CC BB and CC Bb)\n- plain-brown: 50% (from cc BB and cc Bb)\n- red-brown: 50% (from CB + CB and CB + cb)\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since the parents are homozygous for each trait, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene separately, but combined together, the overall phenotypic ratio depends on how many birds have each combination.",
    "rollout": " Since the parents are homozygous for each trait, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene separately, but combined together, the overall phenotypic ratio depends on how many birds have each combination. Let me approach it methodically:\n\nEach parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for each gene. For the C locus, Parent 1 (CC) always gives C, Parent 2 (cc) always gives c. So all F1 gametes are CB. Similarly, for the B locus, Parent 1 (BB) always gives B, Parent 2 (bb) always gives b. So all F1 gametes are CB. Thus, all F1 individuals are CcBb. When they self, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, 50% C, 50% c; same for B locus.\n\nThe possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- Presence (Red): C is dominant \u2192 50%\n- Absence (Plain): c is dominant \u2192 50%\n\nFor B (body color):\n- Presence (Brown): B is dominant \u2192 50%\n- Absence (Checkered): b is dominant \u2192 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype combination is the product of the probabilities of each gene. So, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. Red (C) and Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in reality, the phenotypes would combine into more than four options due to the interaction between the two traits. Actually, each bird will express both traits, so the phenotypic ratio considers the combinations of both traits. Since each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply 1:1:1:1 but rather depends on the number of birds with each combination. Let me consider the actual phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes for a bird are:\n\na. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\nb. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_b_)\nc. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\nd. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, but wait\u2014that\u2019s not accurate because the presence of each trait is dependent on the presence of the dominant allele. For example, a bird cannot be both plain and brown unless it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, no\u2014it's possible for a bird to have both traits expressed only if it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the actual probabilities aren't exactly 25% for each phenotype, but let me calculate them properly.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes for each trait and then determine the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment Red (since C is dominant)\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, combining these, the possible genotypes for a bird are:\n\n1. C_B_ (Pigment Red and Brown)\n2. C_bb (Pigment Red and Checkered)\n3. cc_B_ (Plain and Brown)\n4. cc_bb (Plain and Checkered)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotype described earlier.\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each genotype?\n\nUsing Mendel's laws:\n\n- For Pigment (C):\n  - 25% CC\n  - 50% Cc\n  - 25% cc\n- For Body Color (B):\n  - 25% BB\n  - 50% Bb\n  - 25% bb\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each combination are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo,\n\n1. C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25%\n2. C_bb: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n3. cc_B_: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n4. cc_bb: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigment Red and Brown: 6.25%\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain and Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain and Checkered: 56.25%\n\nThis translates to a phenotypic ratio of approximately 1:3:3:1, but scaled according to these percentages. To make it exact, let's convert these percentages to ratios:\n\nTotal percentage = 100%\n\nPhenotype 1: 6.25% \u2192 1 part\nPhenotype 2: 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype 3: 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype 4: 56.25% \u2192 9 parts\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none directly match this. However, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to count the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation. If the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, then each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is:\n\n- For C (pigment): 25% C, 50% Cc, 25% c\n- For B (body): 25% B, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can compute the number of each genotype and then map it to the phenotype.\n\nBut since we don't have the actual number of birds, we'll assume a large population where the ratios hold.\n\nAlternatively, the number of each phenotype can be computed by counting the possible combinations. For each trait, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. Since both traits are independent, the number of phenotypes is 2\u00d72=4, each with their own counts.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since the parents are homozygous for each trait, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene separately, but combined together, the overall phenotypic ratio depends on how many birds have each combination. Let me approach it methodically:\n\nEach parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for each gene. For the C locus, Parent 1 (CC) always gives C, Parent 2 (cc) always gives c. So all F1 gametes are CB. Similarly, for the B locus, Parent 1 (BB) always gives B, Parent 2 (bb) always gives b. So all F1 gametes are CB. Thus, all F1 individuals are CcBb. When they self, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, 50% C, 50% c; same for B locus.\n\nThe possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- Presence (Red): C is dominant \u2192 50%\n- Absence (Plain): c is dominant \u2192 50%\n\nFor B (body color):\n- Presence (Brown): B is dominant \u2192 50%\n- Absence (Checkered): b is dominant \u2192 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype combination is the product of the probabilities of each gene. So, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. Red (C) and Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in reality, the phenotypes would combine into more than four options due to the interaction between the two traits. Actually, each bird will express both traits, so the phenotypic ratio considers the combinations of both traits. Since each trait is determined independently, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply 1:1:1:1 but rather depends on the number of birds with each combination. Let me consider the actual phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes for a bird are:\n\na. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\nb. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_b_)\nc. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\nd. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, but wait\u2014that\u2019s not accurate because the presence of each trait is dependent on the presence of the dominant allele. For example, a bird cannot be both plain and brown unless it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, no\u2014it's possible for a bird to have both traits expressed only if it has at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the actual probabilities aren't exactly 25% for each phenotype, but let me calculate them properly.\n\nLet's list all possible genotypes for each trait and then determine the corresponding phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment Red (since C is dominant)\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, combining these, the possible genotypes for a bird are:\n\n1. C_B_ (Pigment Red and Brown)\n2. C_bb (Pigment Red and Checkered)\n3. cc_B_ (Plain and Brown)\n4. cc_bb (Plain and Checkered)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotype described earlier.\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each genotype?\n\nUsing Mendel's laws:\n\n- For Pigment (C):\n  - 25% CC\n  - 50% Cc\n  - 25% cc\n- For Body Color (B):\n  - 25% BB\n  - 50% Bb\n  - 25% bb\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each combination are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo,\n\n1. C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25%\n2. C_bb: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n3. cc_B_: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n4. cc_bb: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigment Red and Brown: 6.25%\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain and Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain and Checkered: 56.25%\n\nThis translates to a phenotypic ratio of approximately 1:3:3:1, but scaled according to these percentages. To make it exact, let's convert these percentages to ratios:\n\nTotal percentage = 100%\n\nPhenotype 1: 6.25% \u2192 1 part\nPhenotype 2: 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype 3: 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype 4: 56.25% \u2192 9 parts\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none directly match this. However, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to count the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation. If the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, then each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is:\n\n- For C (pigment): 25% C, 50% Cc, 25% c\n- For B (body): 25% B, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can compute the number of each genotype and then map it to the phenotype.\n\nBut since we don't have the actual number of birds, we'll assume a large population where the ratios hold.\n\nAlternatively, the number of each phenotype can be computed by counting the possible combinations. For each trait, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. Since both traits are independent, the number of phenotypes is 2\u00d72=4, each with their own counts.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, option H says 5, 3, 2, 6, which seems off. Option A says 6, 2, 6, 2, which also doesn't fit. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which matches our 18.75% for checkered and plain, but let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me recount the percentages:\n\n- Pigment Red and Brown: 6.25%\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain and Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain and Checkered: 56.25%\n\nAdding up: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 1, where:\n\n1 part = 6.25%\n\n3 parts = 18.75%\n\nAnother 3 parts = 18.75%\n\n9 parts = 56.25%\n\nLooking at the answer options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That fits our calculation because:\n\n- Checkered red (ccB_) = 56.25% \u2248 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (ccbb) = 18.75% \u2248 3 parts\n- Plain red (CC_) = 18.75% \u2248 3 parts\n- Plain brown (C_C_) = 6.25% \u2248 1 part\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous breakdown. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nIn terms of the answer options, let's see:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red: 1 part \u2192 3 birds\n- checkered brown: 3 parts \u2192 9 birds\n- plain red: 3 parts \u2192 3 birds\n- plain brown: 9 parts \u2192 9 birds\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, checkered brown (ccbb) is 18.75% \u2192 3 birds (\u22483), plain brown (C_C_) is 6.25% \u2192 1 bird, checkered red (C_B_) is 56.25% \u2192 ~3, and plain red (cc_B_) is 18.75% \u2192 ~3.

So for pigment color: red if at least one C, plain otherwise. Similarly, for body color: brown if at least one B, else plain.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and plain (c and B recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation would have 9 possible phenotypic ratios if all combinations were equally likely. But in reality, due to dominance, some combinations might lead to the same phenotype. However, in this case, since the dominance is straightforward (C and B are dominant), each phenotype corresponds uniquely to a specific combination of alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would reflect the probabilities of each combination.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated by looking at the frequency of each genotype in F2. For each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for the C locus: the probability of having at least one C (pigment red) is 3/4 (since each gamete contributes a 50% chance of giving either allele, and at least one being C happens 3/4 of the time). Similarly, for B locus: the probability of having at least one B (brown) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. However, this approach counts the number of phenotypic combinations, not the actual number of birds. Wait, no\u2014it counts the probability of each phenotype type. So:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Plain): Probability = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Plain): Probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nBut wait, this seems off because the sum of these probabilities is 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16, which checks out. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so it's 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16, but 12+2+2=16, but 0 doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers don't align.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers are different.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, but order differs.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers differ.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, which is wrong.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16, but all equal, which isn't the case here.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers don't align.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, which matches.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since both genes are acting independently, the number of possible phenotypes is 3 (pigment) \u00d7 3 (body color) = 9. But given the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes might combine into fewer. Wait, no, each gene has two traits, so the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n- Pigment red (since C is dominant over c)\n- Plain (since c is recessive)\n- Pigment brown (since B is dominant over b)\n- Plain brown (both recessive)\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in the respective trait. So for pigment color: red if at least one C, plain otherwise. Similarly, for body color: brown if at least one B, else plain.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and plain (c and B recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation would have 9 possible phenotypic ratios if all combinations were equally likely. But in reality, due to dominance, some combinations might lead to the same phenotype. However, in this case, since the dominance is straightforward (C and B are dominant), each phenotype corresponds uniquely to a specific combination of alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would reflect the probabilities of each combination.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated by looking at the frequency of each genotype in F2. For each gene, the presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for the C locus: the probability of having at least one C (pigment red) is 3/4 (since each gamete contributes a 50% chance of giving either allele, and at least one being C happens 3/4 of the time). Similarly, for B locus: the probability of having at least one B (brown) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. However, this approach counts the number of phenotypic combinations, not the actual number of birds. Wait, no\u2014it counts the probability of each phenotype type. So:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Plain): Probability = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Plain): Probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nBut wait, this seems off because the sum of these probabilities is 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16, which checks out. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so it's 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16, but 12+2+2=16, but 0 doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers don't align.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers are different.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, but order differs.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers differ.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, which is wrong.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16, but all equal, which isn't the case here.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but numbers don't align.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, which matches. So option C says 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That fits our calculation where the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.",
    "rollout": " Let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 75%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 75%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. c (plain) and B dominant: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Plain red: (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Plain brown: (0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56 : 18 : 18 : 6, but looking at the options given, none directly match this. Wait, but the options might be simplified or rounded differently. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 18: 6, 18:6, 6:6, 2:2?

Wait, my calculated percentages were roughly 56:18:18:6, which simplifies to 56/6 \u2248 9.33, but that's not matching any option exactly. Maybe the options consider rounding or different approaches. Alternatively, perhaps the approach taken in the options assumes a different method, such as considering the actual number of possible gametes without considering dominance.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps the options count the possible phenotypes based on the number of birds in the F2 generation. Since each F1 is CcBb, producing four gametes, the F2 will have 16 possible genotypes. But considering dominance, some genotypes will result in the same phenotype. Let's see how many phenotypes there are.\n\nEach F2 bird will have a genotype combination based on the F1 gametes. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Red)\n2. CC Bb (Brown)\n3. CC bb (Checkered)\n4. Cc BB (Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered)\n6. Cc bb (Checkered)\n7. cc BB (Plain)\n8. cc Bb (Checkered)\n9. cc bb (Plain)\n\nBut considering dominance, some of these will express the same phenotype. For example, C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Red. Similarly, C (dominant) and b \u2192 Checkered. c (recessive) and B \u2192 Brown. c and b \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red (any C and B dominant)\n- Brown (any C dominant, B recessive)\n- Checkered (any c, B dominant)\n- Plain (any c, B recessive)\n\nNow, counting how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype:\n\nRed: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 types, each contributing 2 individuals (since each gamete is equally likely, but actually, each F2 bird comes from two F1 gametes, so each genotype corresponds to one bird). So 3 red.\n\nBrown: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 types, each contributes 2 individuals \u2192 2 brown.\n\nCheckered: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 types, each contributes 2 \u2192 2 checkered.\n\nPlain: cc bb \u2192 1 type \u2192 1 plain.\n\nWait, but this counts the number of distinct genotypes, but the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds, not the number of genotypes. Wait, no, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which depends on the number of birds expressing each phenotype.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 birds: 16 (since each F1 has 4 gametes, leading to 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C and one B dominant \u2192 How many?\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to dominance, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or not. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C and one B dominant allele \u2192 Red\n- Any bird with at least one C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Checkered\n- Any bird with at least one c and B dominant \u2192 Brown\n- Any bird with at least one c and B recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square to determine the exact number of each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 genotypes can be represented as follows:\n\n- 9 possible genotype combinations (assuming independent assortment):\n  1. CC BB\n  2. CC Bb\n  3. CC bb\n  4. Cc BB\n  5. Cc Bb\n  6. Cc bb\n  7. cc BB\n  8. cc Bb\n  9. cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotype for each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red (since B is dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered: Cases 3,5,6,8 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain: Cases 7,9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+4+2=9, but there are 16 birds. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 9 genotype combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nThat's 3 Reds, 4 Checkereds, and 2 Planes. So the ratio is 3:4:2:1. But this doesn't match any of the given options. Hmm, something's wrong here because the options don't include this ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me list each bird's phenotype based on the number of alleles:\n\n- Red: Needs at least one C and one B dominant. So any bird where either C is present or B is present, but not both recessive. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the phenotype is red if the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant). Otherwise, it's brown or plain. Wait, no, dominance applies to each trait separately. So, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. If either C or B is recessive, it becomes brown or plain.\n\nSimilarly, for a bird to be checkered, it must have at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n\nAnd for a bird to be plain, it must have at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b.\n\nWait, that's more precise. So, applying this to each bird in the F2 population:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by their alleles:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, now this changes things. So earlier, I thought some were Checkered, others Brown, but now I realize that depending on the alleles, some may become Brown instead of Checkered.\n\nSo re-evaluating the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 6,7,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nThis totals 3+1+3+1=8 birds. That still doesn't match the options given. Maybe the approach needs to consider the actual number of birds rather than the number of genotypes. Let me try that.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are 16 possible combinations of alleles (since each F1 bird can produce 4 alleles, leading to 4x4=16 F2 birds). Now, considering dominance, some combinations lead to the same phenotype. So:\n\n- For Red: Any bird with at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant). So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 Red\n  - CC Bb \u2192 Red\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Red\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (since c is recessive)\n  - Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (because B is recessive)\n  - cc BB \u2192 Plain (since c is recessive)\n  \nWait, no\u2014that approach isn't accounting for dominance correctly. Actually, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. If either allele is recessive, it becomes brown or plain.\n\nSo, the correct way is:\n\n- To be red: Must have at least one C and at least one B. So, the genotypes are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n\n- To be checkered: Must have at least one c and at least one B. Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb.\n\n- To be brown: Must have at least one c and at least one b. Genotypes: cc bb.\n\n- To be plain: Must have at least one c and at least one b. Only genotype: cc bb.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nA bird will display a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant), it will be red.\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one b (recessive), it will be checkered.\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant), it will be brown.\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive), it will be plain.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 population:\n\n- Red: All genotypes where C and B are both present. So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n\n- Checkered: Genotypes where c is present and B is present. So, cc BB, cc Bb.\n\n- Brown: Genotypes where c is present and b is present. So, cc bb.\n\n- Plain: Only cc bb.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Red: 4 genotypes (as above)\n- Checkered: 2 genotypes\n- Brown: 1 genotype\n- Plain: 1 genotype\n\nAssuming each genotype results in one bird, then the ratio is 4:2:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided don't include this exact ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving a specific ratio. Looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which would imply a ratio like 1:3:9:3, but that doesn't fit our current understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's think differently. In a dihybrid cross with two independent genes, the expected phenotypic ratio under complete dominance and independent assortment is typically 9:3:3:1, but that usually refers to two traits each with two alleles. However, in this case, we have four possible traits, but due to dominance, some combine into fewer phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the number of birds expressed in each phenotype, not the number of genotypes. Let me consider that.\n\nIf each F2 bird is considered individually, then the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C and one B \u2192 How many in F2? From the Punnett square approach, the number is 3 (as before) but considering dominance, perhaps more. Wait, no\u2014if each bird is counted based on their phenotype, regardless of the number of alleles, then:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant) \u2192 These would be the cases where both C and B are present in their alleles.\n\n- Checkered: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant).\n\n- Brown: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive).\n\n- Plain: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive).\n\nWait, but that's similar to what I did before, resulting in 4:2:1:1 ratio. So why does the option D have a 1:3:9:3 ratio? That suggests a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the options are considering the actual number of birds in the F2 generation, which is 16. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 9 F2 genotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by the number of dominant and recessive alleles. So, each bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Red: At least one C and at least one B.\n2. Checkered: At least one c and at least one B.\n3. Brown: At least one c and at least one b.\n4. Plain: At least one c and at least one b.\n\nNow, mapping this to the 9 F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, phenotypes and counts:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 5,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nBut this totals 3+1+4+1=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some cases. Let me list all 16 F2 birds:\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I've already accounted for all nine possible genotypes in the F2 generation. Perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that some genotypes are not present in the F2, but in reality, all possible combinations exist. Wait, no, in a dihybrid cross with F1 being CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 should theoretically have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation, but considering dominance, the actual phenotypic ratio might differ.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are referring to the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of birds. Let's assume there are 16 birds in the F2 generation (since each F1 bird produces 4, leading to 4\u00d74=16). Then, based on dominance, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 5,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWhich sums to 9, but since we're dealing with 16 birds, perhaps each case represents multiple birds. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't working. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach: using the standard Punnett square for dihybrid crosses with dominance.\n\nThe F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | c   b\n        ----------------\n      Cc    | CcCc | Ccbb\n        -----------------\n      cc    | ccCC | ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. The F2 should be based on the F1 gametes, which are CcBB and ccbb. So the Punnett square should be:\n\n           | Cc | cc\n         -----------------\n       Cc | CcCc | Cc cc\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 75%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 75%\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. c (plain) and B dominant: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Plain red: (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Plain brown: (0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56 : 18 : 18 : 6, but looking at the options given, none directly match this. Wait, but the options might be simplified or rounded differently. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 18: 6, 18:6, 6:6, 2:2? Doesn't seem right.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 This seems different from our calculation.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Again, doesn't align.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, this could be scaling up by a factor of 4. Wait, my calculated percentages were roughly 56:18:18:6, which simplifies to 56/6 \u2248 9.33, but that's not matching any option exactly. Maybe the options consider rounding or different approaches. Alternatively, perhaps the approach taken in the options assumes a different method, such as considering the actual number of possible gametes without considering dominance.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps the options count the possible phenotypes based on the number of birds in the F2 generation. Since each F1 is CcBb, producing four gametes, the F2 will have 16 possible genotypes. But considering dominance, some genotypes will result in the same phenotype. Let's see how many phenotypes there are.\n\nEach F2 bird will have a genotype combination based on the F1 gametes. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Red)\n2. CC Bb (Brown)\n3. CC bb (Checkered)\n4. Cc BB (Red)\n5. Cc Bb (Checkered)\n6. Cc bb (Checkered)\n7. cc BB (Plain)\n8. cc Bb (Checkered)\n9. cc bb (Plain)\n\nBut considering dominance, some of these will express the same phenotype. For example, C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Red. Similarly, C (dominant) and b \u2192 Checkered. c (recessive) and B \u2192 Brown. c and b \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red (any C and B dominant)\n- Brown (any C dominant, B recessive)\n- Checkered (any c, B dominant)\n- Plain (any c, B recessive)\n\nNow, counting how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype:\n\nRed: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 types, each contributing 2 individuals (since each gamete is equally likely, but actually, each F2 bird comes from two F1 gametes, so each genotype corresponds to one bird). So 3 red.\n\nBrown: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 types, each contributes 2 individuals \u2192 2 brown.\n\nCheckered: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 types, each contributes 2 \u2192 2 checkered.\n\nPlain: cc bb \u2192 1 type \u2192 1 plain.\n\nWait, but this counts the number of distinct genotypes, but the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds, not the number of genotypes. Wait, no, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which depends on the number of birds expressing each phenotype.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 birds: 16 (since each F1 has 4 gametes, leading to 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C and one B dominant \u2192 How many?\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to dominance, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or not. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C and one B dominant allele \u2192 Red\n- Any bird with at least one C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Checkered\n- Any bird with at least one c and B dominant \u2192 Brown\n- Any bird with at least one c and B recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square to determine the exact number of each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 genotypes can be represented as follows:\n\n- 9 possible genotype combinations (assuming independent assortment):\n  1. CC BB\n  2. CC Bb\n  3. CC bb\n  4. Cc BB\n  5. Cc Bb\n  6. Cc bb\n  7. cc BB\n  8. cc Bb\n  9. cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotype for each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red (since B is dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered: Cases 3,5,6,8 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain: Cases 7,9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+4+2=9, but there are 16 birds. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 9 genotype combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nThat's 3 Reds, 4 Checkereds, and 2 Planes. So the ratio is 3:4:2:1. But this doesn't match any of the given options. Hmm, something's wrong here because the options don't include this ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me list each bird's phenotype based on the number of alleles:\n\n- Red: Needs at least one C and one B dominant. So any bird where either C is present or B is present, but not both recessive. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the phenotype is red if the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant). Otherwise, it's brown or plain. Wait, no, dominance applies to each trait separately. So, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. If either C or B is recessive, it becomes brown or plain.\n\nSimilarly, for a bird to be checkered, it must have at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n\nAnd for a bird to be plain, it must have at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b.\n\nWait, that's more precise. So, applying this to each bird in the F2 population:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by their alleles:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, now this changes things. So earlier, I thought some were Checkered, others Brown, but now I realize that depending on the alleles, some may become Brown instead of Checkered.\n\nSo re-evaluating the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 6,7,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nThis totals 3+1+3+1=8 birds. That still doesn't match the options given. Maybe the approach needs to consider the actual number of birds rather than the number of genotypes. Let me try that.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are 16 possible combinations of alleles (since each F1 bird can produce 4 alleles, leading to 4x4=16 F2 birds). Now, considering dominance, some combinations lead to the same phenotype. So:\n\n- For Red: Any bird with at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant). So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 Red\n  - CC Bb \u2192 Red\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Red\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (since c is recessive)\n  - Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (because B is recessive)\n  - cc BB \u2192 Plain (since c is recessive)\n  \nWait, no\u2014that approach isn't accounting for dominance correctly. Actually, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. If either allele is recessive, it becomes brown or plain.\n\nSo, the correct way is:\n\n- To be red: Must have at least one C and at least one B. So, the genotypes are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n\n- To be checkered: Must have at least one c and at least one B. Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb.\n\n- To be brown: Must have at least one c and at least one b. Genotypes: cc bb.\n\n- To be plain: Must have at least one c and at least one b. Only genotype: cc bb.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nA bird will display a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant), it will be red.\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (dominant) and at least one b (recessive), it will be checkered.\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant), it will be brown.\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive), it will be plain.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 population:\n\n- Red: All genotypes where C and B are both present. So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n\n- Checkered: Genotypes where c is present and B is present. So, cc BB, cc Bb.\n\n- Brown: Genotypes where c is present and b is present. So, cc bb.\n\n- Plain: Only cc bb.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Red: 4 genotypes (as above)\n- Checkered: 2 genotypes\n- Brown: 1 genotype\n- Plain: 1 genotype\n\nAssuming each genotype results in one bird, then the ratio is 4:2:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided don't include this exact ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving a specific ratio. Looking at option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which would imply a ratio like 1:3:9:3, but that doesn't fit our current understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's think differently. In a dihybrid cross with two independent genes, the expected phenotypic ratio under complete dominance and independent assortment is typically 9:3:3:1, but that usually refers to two traits each with two alleles. However, in this case, we have four possible traits, but due to dominance, some combine into fewer phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the number of birds expressed in each phenotype, not the number of genotypes. Let me consider that.\n\nIf each F2 bird is considered individually, then the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C and one B \u2192 How many in F2? From the Punnett square approach, the number is 3 (as before) but considering dominance, perhaps more. Wait, no\u2014if each bird is counted based on their phenotype, regardless of the number of alleles, then:\n\n- Red: All birds with at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant) \u2192 These would be the cases where both C and B are present in their alleles.\n\n- Checkered: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant).\n\n- Brown: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive).\n\n- Plain: Birds with at least one c (recessive) and at least one b (recessive).\n\nWait, but that's similar to what I did before, resulting in 4:2:1:1 ratio. So why does the option D have a 1:3:9:3 ratio? That suggests a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the options are considering the actual number of birds in the F2 generation, which is 16. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 9 F2 genotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by the number of dominant and recessive alleles. So, each bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Red: At least one C and at least one B.\n2. Checkered: At least one c and at least one B.\n3. Brown: At least one c and at least one b.\n4. Plain: At least one c and at least one b.\n\nNow, mapping this to the 9 F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, phenotypes and counts:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 5,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nBut this totals 3+1+4+1=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some cases. Let me list all 16 F2 birds:\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I've already accounted for all nine possible genotypes in the F2 generation. Perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that some genotypes are not present in the F2, but in reality, all possible combinations exist. Wait, no, in a dihybrid cross with F1 being CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 should theoretically have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation, but considering dominance, the actual phenotypic ratio might differ.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are referring to the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of birds. Let's assume there are 16 birds in the F2 generation (since each F1 bird produces 4, leading to 4\u00d74=16). Then, based on dominance, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3\n- Checkered: Case 3 \u2192 1\n- Brown: Cases 5,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWhich sums to 9, but since we're dealing with 16 birds, perhaps each case represents multiple birds. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't working. I'm getting confused here.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:",
    "rollout": " Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This requires at least one dominant allele for each gene. The probability for pigment red is 75% (since C is dominant, the chance is 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4). Similarly, for brown color, the probability is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): This requires C dominant (75%) and b recessive (25%). Probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B): This requires c recessive (25%) and B dominant (75%). Probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b): This requires c and b. Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4 = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding them up gives 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Matches our 9:3:3:1.\nD.

Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let's see:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: probability of being C (red) is 3/4, b (plain) is 1/4.\n- B: probability of being B (brown) is 3/4, b (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 3: c, B \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 4: c, b \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because according to our calculations, none of the phenotypes should have zero count except maybe plain brown. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me read it again:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by C, and plain by c. Red is B, brown by b. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut if the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, does it include all four phenotypes or exclude some? Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different from our calculation where checkered red is higher than plain red. Wait, no, in our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype 1) is 9/16, while plain red is 1/16. But option D says checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So that suggests that the ratio is inverted compared to our expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So, the checkered pattern is due to C, and plain color is due to c. So, the checkered bird has the dominant C allele, making it checkered, while the plain bird has the recessive c allele. Similarly, red is B, brown is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\nCheckered (C) and red (B): 9/16\nCheckered (C) and brown (b): 3/16\nPlain (c) and red (B): 3/16\nPlain (c) and brown (b): 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts, assuming 16 birds:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, J is Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, which isn't matching. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 9+3+3+1=16. If each part is divided by 16, then:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nCheckered brown: 3/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 1/16\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at option J again: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is half of 16. Perhaps the actual numbers are scaled differently, but usually, ratios don't scale like that unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the phenotypes without considering the dominance, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of any dominant trait, regardless of the other. Let me try that.\n\nIf a bird has either dominant C or dominant B, it might be considered as having a certain color, ignoring the recessive traits. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (regardless of B), it's red.\n- If B is dominant (regardless of C), it's brown.\n\nSo, phenotypes could be:\n\nRed (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): 9/16\nRed (C dominant) and checkered (b): 3/16\nPlain (c) and red (C): 3/16\nPlain (c) and brown (B): 1/16\n\nSame as before. So the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. None of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't add up.\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, but according to our calculation, it should sum to 16. Unless the question is missing something, maybe the sum isn't required, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the number of birds with checkered vs plain, and red vs brown, but the way the options are structured, maybe it's counting the number of birds with checkered red versus checkered brown, etc. Let's consider that.\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red is 9/16 and checkered brown is 3/16. So the ratio of checkered red to checkered brown would be 9:3 or simplified 3:1. Similarly, plain red is 3/16 and plain brown is 1/16, giving a ratio of 3:1. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That's the inverse of what we have. So checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3; but in reality, checkered red is much higher.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't align.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No, because none of the phenotypes are 0.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, that's our ratio.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, wrong order.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't our case.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\nOption L: 12,5,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nSo, Option C seems to fit our ratio of 9:3:3:1. But looking back, perhaps I miscounted. Let me confirm:\n\nEach gene has three possible states, so four phenotypes. The counts should be 9,3,3,1. So yes, Option C matches.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This requires at least one dominant allele for each gene. The probability for pigment red is 75% (since C is dominant, the chance is 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4). Similarly, for brown color, the probability is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): This requires C dominant (75%) and b recessive (25%). Probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B): This requires c recessive (25%) and B dominant (75%). Probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b): This requires c and b. Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4 = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Adding them up gives 16 parts.

Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let's see:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: probability of being C (red) is 3/4, b (plain) is 1/4.\n- B: probability of being B (brown) is 3/4, b (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 3: c, B \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 4: c, b \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding these: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because according to our calculations, none of the phenotypes should have zero count except maybe plain brown. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me read it again:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by C, and plain by c. Red is B, brown by b. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut if the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, does it include all four phenotypes or exclude some? Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different from our calculation where checkered red is higher than plain red. Wait, no, in our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype 1) is 9/16, while plain red is 1/16. But option D says checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So that suggests that the ratio is inverted compared to our expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So, the checkered pattern is due to C, and plain color is due to c. So, the checkered bird has the dominant C allele, making it checkered, while the plain bird has the recessive c allele. Similarly, red is B, brown is b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\nCheckered (C) and red (B): 9/16\nCheckered (C) and brown (b): 3/16\nPlain (c) and red (B): 3/16\nPlain (c) and brown (b): 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts, assuming 16 birds:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, J is Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, which isn't matching. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 9+3+3+1=16. If each part is divided by 16, then:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nCheckered brown: 3/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 1/16\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at option J again: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is half of 16. Perhaps the actual numbers are scaled differently, but usually, ratios don't scale like that unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the phenotypes without considering the dominance, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of any dominant trait, regardless of the other. Let me try that.\n\nIf a bird has either dominant C or dominant B, it might be considered as having a certain color, ignoring the recessive traits. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (regardless of B), it's red.\n- If B is dominant (regardless of C), it's brown.\n\nSo, phenotypes could be:\n\nRed (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): 9/16\nRed (C dominant) and checkered (b): 3/16\nPlain (c) and red (C): 3/16\nPlain (c) and brown (B): 1/16\n\nSame as before. So the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. None of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't add up.\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, but according to our calculation, it should sum to 16. Unless the question is missing something, maybe the sum isn't required, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the number of birds with checkered vs plain, and red vs brown, but the way the options are structured, maybe it's counting the number of birds with checkered red versus checkered brown, etc. Let's consider that.\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red is 9/16 and checkered brown is 3/16. So the ratio of checkered red to checkered brown would be 9:3 or simplified 3:1. Similarly, plain red is 3/16 and plain brown is 1/16, giving a ratio of 3:1. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That's the inverse of what we have. So checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3; but in reality, checkered red is much higher.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't align.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No, because none of the phenotypes are 0.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, that's our ratio.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, wrong order.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't our case.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\nOption L: 12,5,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nSo, Option C seems to fit our ratio of 9:3:3:1. But looking back, perhaps I miscounted. Let me confirm:\n\nEach gene has three possible states, so four phenotypes. The counts should be 9,3,3,1. So yes, Option C matches.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that the F2 generation is produced by a selfing of the F1, which is CcBb, the F2 will have 25% CC (which would be red and brown), 25% Cc (red and checkered), 25% cc (plain and brown), and 25% bb (plain and checkered).",

Now, converting these into phenotypic categories:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (Cc_b_)\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (_C_bb)\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (__ccb)\n\nWait, but some phenotypes might overlap. For example, if a bird has C and B, it's Pigment red and brown. If it has c and B, it's Plain and brown.

But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. Let me see what each option says:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Not matching our 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Let me double-check. The dominance hierarchy is such that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So, for pigment color, any C allele makes the bird red, regardless of B. For body color, any B allele makes the bird brown, regardless of C. So the possible phenotypes are indeed four, each with 25% frequency. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly reflect that. Hmm.\n\nLooking again at the options, Option A: 6,2,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16, which isn't 4. Option B: 8,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum is 20. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 That sums to 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16. None of these options sum to 4, which suggests I've misunderstood something. Wait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of individuals rather than phenotypes. Let me reconsider the F2 calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of birds in each category, not the phenotypes. Let me reevaluate the F2 generation. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. When crossed, the F2 would have four possible combinations, each with 25% probability. However, the actual count depends on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the counts would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options suggest different numbers, like option F: 4,4,4,4. Wait, perhaps each trait is considered separately, leading to four phenotypic categories, each with 25% occurrence. But the options don't align with that either.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratios in terms of the number of each phenotype, not the percentage. Let me try that. Since each of the four F2 genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype, the counts would be equal across the four phenotypes. So, if there are N birds, each phenotypic group would have N/4 birds. But the options don't represent this. Instead, they represent the counts of each phenotype type relative to others. For instance, option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This suggests that one phenotype has 1 part, another 3 parts, another 9 parts, and the last 3 parts. Wait, that seems off because 1+3+9+3 = 16, implying 16 birds in total. But each part represents the proportion of the total. So, the ratio would be 1:3:9:3, but scaled up to the actual number of birds. However, none of the options directly state this. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basics. The F2 generation comes from a selfing of the F1, which itself is the result of crossing the two parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb. Selfing leads to the F2 having 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. These correspond to:\n\n- CC (red pigment, brown body)\n- Cc (red pigment, checkered body)\n- cc (plain pigment, brown body)\n- bb (plain pigment, checkered body)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, translating this into phenotypic ratios, each phenotype has 25% occurrence. However, the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1. Perhaps the options are misrepresenting the ratios, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentages. So, if there are 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratios based on the dominance hierarchy, where some phenotypes may combine. For example, a bird with both C and B alleles would express both traits: red pigment and brown body. Similarly, a bird with C and b would express red pigment and checkered body, and vice versa. So, the four phenotypes are distinct, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Looking again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 16 birds, but the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which resembles a squared relationship, possibly indicating dominance patterns. Wait, but how does that apply here?\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes not only the four phenotypes but also other combinations due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, it's straightforward Mendelian inheritance without mention of blending traits. So, the F2 should have four phenotypes, each with equal representation.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them directly say 1:1:1:1. However, option D states \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Adding those up, 1+3+9+3=16 birds. If each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, then perhaps this accounts for dominance or other factors affecting the distribution. However, according to standard Mendelian genetics, each phenotype should occur equally often, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Another possibility is that the question is not about the F2 generation but the F1 generation. However, the user specified F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each type of bird, not the proportion. So, if there are 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Looking again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This could be interpreted as 1 part checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 9 parts plain red, 3 parts plain brown. This suggests that the majority of the birds are plain red and plain brown, with fewer checkered ones. But why would that happen? In reality, without dominance interactions, each phenotype should be equal.\n\nUnless there's a different reasoning here. Let me think: Maybe the question is considering the number of birds with each trait, including those who might not express all traits due to incomplete dominance. But the question specifies that the traits are determined by the genes, and each bird shows all applicable traits unless otherwise stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, but that would still lead to equal representation.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to recast my approach. The F2 generation should have 25% of each possible phenotype. Therefore, if there are N birds, each phenotype occurs N/4 times. But the options don't specify this; instead, they provide specific counts relative to each other. So, if the total is 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the options reflect this except for option F, which says 4,4,4,4. However, option F is labeled as \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which adds up to 16, but the ratio is 1:1:1:1, not 4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the ratio of each phenotype compared to the others. For example, option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a scenario where one phenotype is rare and others are more common, which wouldn't apply here.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the confusion, I'll make a best guess based on standard Mendelian inheritance, expecting a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option D, which reflects a different distribution. However, without clear evidence, I cannot be certain. \n\nAnother angle: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which is typically 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the intended answer considers the dominance hierarchy, leading to different counts. If the dominant alleles for pigment and body color interact, the ratios change, but without such interaction, they remain equal.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that the F2 generation is produced by a selfing of the F1, which is CcBb, the F2 will have 25% CC (which would be red and brown), 25% Cc (red and checkered), 25% cc (plain and brown), and 25% bb (plain and checkered). Now, converting these into phenotypic categories:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (Cc_b_)\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (_C_bb)\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (__ccb)\n\nWait, but some phenotypes might overlap. For example, if a bird has C and B, it's Pigment red and brown. If it has c and B, it's Plain and brown. Similarly for C and b, and c and b.\n\nNow, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% Pigment red and brown (Phenotype 1)\n- 25% Pigment red and checkered (Phenotype 2)\n- 25% Plain and brown (Phenotype 3)\n- 25% Plain and checkered (Phenotype 4)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios.

Let me double-check. The dominance hierarchy is such that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So, for pigment color, any C allele makes the bird red, regardless of B. For body color, any B allele makes the bird brown, regardless of C. So the possible phenotypes are indeed four, each with 25% frequency. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly reflect that. Hmm.\n\nLooking again at the options, Option A: 6,2,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16, which isn't 4. Option B: 8,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum is 20. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16.

None of these options sum to 4, which suggests I've misunderstood something. Wait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of individuals rather than phenotypes. Let me reconsider the F2 calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of birds in each category, not the phenotypes. Let me reevaluate the F2 generation. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. When crossed, the F2 would have four possible combinations, each with 25% probability. However, the actual count depends on the number of offspring. Assuming a large population, the counts would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options suggest different numbers, like option F: 4,4,4,4. Wait, perhaps each trait is considered separately, leading to four phenotypic categories, each with 25% occurrence. But the options don't align with that either.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratios in terms of the number of each phenotype, not the percentage. Let me try that. Since each of the four F2 genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype, the counts would be equal across the four phenotypes. So, if there are N birds, each phenotypic group would have N/4 birds. But the options don't represent this. Instead, they represent the counts of each phenotype type relative to others. For instance, option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This suggests that one phenotype has 1 part, another 3 parts, another 9 parts, and the last 3 parts. Wait, that seems off because 1+3+9+3 = 16, implying 16 birds in total. But each part represents the proportion of the total. So, the ratio would be 1:3:9:3, but scaled up to the actual number of birds. However, none of the options directly state this. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basics. The F2 generation comes from a selfing of the F1, which itself is the result of crossing the two parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb. Selfing leads to the F2 having 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. These correspond to:\n\n- CC (red pigment, brown body)\n- Cc (red pigment, checkered body)\n- cc (plain pigment, brown body)\n- bb (plain pigment, checkered body)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, translating this into phenotypic ratios, each phenotype has 25% occurrence. However, the options provided do not include 1:1:1:1. Perhaps the options are misrepresenting the ratios, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentages. So, if there are 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratios based on the dominance hierarchy, where some phenotypes may combine. For example, a bird with both C and B alleles would express both traits: red pigment and brown body. Similarly, a bird with C and b would express red pigment and checkered body, and vice versa. So, the four phenotypes are distinct, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Looking again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 16 birds, but the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which resembles a squared relationship, possibly indicating dominance patterns. Wait, but how does that apply here?\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes not only the four phenotypes but also other combinations due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, it's straightforward Mendelian inheritance without mention of blending traits. So, the F2 should have four phenotypes, each with equal representation.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them directly say 1:1:1:1. However, option D states \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Adding those up, 1+3+9+3=16 birds. If each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, then perhaps this accounts for dominance or other factors affecting the distribution. However, according to standard Mendelian genetics, each phenotype should occur equally often, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Another possibility is that the question is not about the F2 generation but the F1 generation. However, the user specified F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each type of bird, not the proportion. So, if there are 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Looking again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This could be interpreted as 1 part checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 9 parts plain red, 3 parts plain brown. This suggests that the majority of the birds are plain red and plain brown, with fewer checkered ones. But why would that happen? In reality, without dominance interactions, each phenotype should be equal.\n\nUnless there's a different reasoning here. Let me think: Maybe the question is considering the number of birds with each trait, including those who might not express all traits due to incomplete dominance. But the question specifies that the traits are determined by the genes, and each bird shows all applicable traits unless otherwise stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, but that would still lead to equal representation.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to recast my approach. The F2 generation should have 25% of each possible phenotype. Therefore, if there are N birds, each phenotype occurs N/4 times. But the options don't specify this; instead, they provide specific counts relative to each other. So, if the total is 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the options reflect this except for option F, which says 4,4,4,4. However, option F is labeled as \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which adds up to 16, but the ratio is 1:1:1:1, not 4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the ratio of each phenotype compared to the others. For example, option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a scenario where one phenotype is rare and others are more common, which wouldn't apply here.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the confusion, I'll make a best guess based on standard Mendelian inheritance, expecting a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option D, which reflects a different distribution. However, without clear evidence, I cannot be certain. \n\nAnother angle: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which is typically 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the intended answer considers the dominance hierarchy, leading to different counts. If the dominant alleles for pigment and body color interact, the ratios change, but without such interaction, they remain equal.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for each gene, the probability of each trait is:",
    "rollout": " So for each gene, the probability of each trait is:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1/2 (since it's heterozygous)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 1/2\n\nFor color (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 1/2\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach of these combines to make four phenotypic classes. Now, to find the actual counts, we calculate the number of each class in the F2 generation. Each parent contributes gametes at a 50% frequency for each trait. Therefore, the F2 will have four phenotypic classes, each occurring at different probabilities.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: presence (red)\n- cc: absence (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- B_: presence (brown)\n- bb: absence (checkered)\n\nSo, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic classes based on these two traits. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider the distribution of these classes in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2 generation, the probability of each phenotype can be found by considering the combination of the two traits. Since each gene acts independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C_: 1/2\n- Probability of cc: 1/2\n\nFor color (B):\n- Probability of B_: 1/2\n- Probability of bb: 1/2\n\nNow, the four phenotypic classes correspond to the following combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and color brown (B_): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigment red (C_) and color checkered (bb): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n3. Pigment plain (cc) and color brown (B_): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n4. Pigment plain (cc) and color checkered (bb): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all four phenotypes are equally likely, each at 25%. However, this isn't matching any of the options given. Let me double-check my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypic ratios directly. Maybe I need to look at the possible genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes based on the two genes:\n\nGenotype for C:\n- CC\n- Cc\n- cC\n- cc\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB\n- Bb\n- bB\n- bb\n\nBut since C and B are independent, the four phenotypes are combinations of these. However, the phenotypes aren't simply additive but rather multiplicative based on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Since each bird is a dihybrid, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But that might not apply here because the question seems to focus on specific phenotypes like checkered red, etc., rather than the general ratio. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c for the color gene B, and the plain color is determined by the recessive allele b for the pigment gene C. Also, the dominant alleles are C for pigment and B for color.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation will have four phenotypic classes corresponding to the combinations of C and B being dominant or recessive. As I thought earlier, each combination has a probability of 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 18. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 total 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 total 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 total 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 total 16.\n\nHmm, but according to my calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, totaling 16 if we assume a large population. But looking at option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, the total is 16. That matches my expectation. So, does that mean the correct answer is G?\n\nWait, but why would some phenotypes not appear? Because maybe certain combinations don't manifest due to incomplete dominance or other factors. But the question specifies that the dominant alleles are present, and the recessive are absent. So perhaps all four phenotypes do appear, each at 25%.\n\nBut why is option G the one presented? Let me see the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK. Looking at K, which isn't shown. From the user's message, he provided J as \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Totaling 12, which is less than 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which totals 16. But none of the options exactly match 25% except G. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation isn't 1:1:1:1 because some combinations may not be possible. Let me think differently. Maybe the F2 generation includes only those where both traits are expressed, but that doesn't change the phenotypic ratio much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations regardless of whether they express the trait. In that case, each phenotype would indeed have 25% occurrence, making the ratio 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. If each phenotype were equally represented, each should be 4. But in reality, perhaps some phenotypes don't appear because they require certain genotypes that aren't possible. Wait, but according to the dihybrid cross, all four phenotypes should be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers only the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones, but that wouldn't make sense because the recessive alleles would be absent, leading to the other phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the actual counts based on the F2 generation. The F1 generation is CcBb. When selfed, each allele is equally likely to go to each gamete. So the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB (all dominant, checkered and red)\n2. CC Bb (checkered and brown)\n3. CC bb (checkered and plain)\n4. Cc BB (painted red and brown)\n5. Cc Bb (painted red and plain)\n6. Cc bb (painted red and plain)\n7. cc BB (plain and brown)\n8. cc Bb (plain and brown)\n9. cc bb (plain and plain)\n\nWait, but no, this approach is missing something. The correct way is to consider all possible combinations. Actually, the F2 will have four phenotypes, each with a certain frequency based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having both dominant traits (C_ and B_) is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Similarly for the others. So each phenotype occurs at 25% probability.\n\nThus, if we consider a large population, each phenotype would be approximately 1/4 of the total. But none of the answer options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option G shows checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, totaling 16. This aligns with a 1:1:1:1 ratio, assuming each phenotype appears equally often. Therefore, option G must be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Pigment red (C_) and color brown (B_): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigment red (C_) and color checkered (bb): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n3. Pigment plain (cc) and color brown (B_): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n4. Pigment plain (cc) and color checkered (bb): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all four phenotypes are equally likely, each at 25%. However, this isn't matching any of the options given. Let me double-check my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypic ratios directly. Maybe I need to look at the possible genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes based on the two genes:\n\nGenotype for C:\n- CC\n- Cc\n- cC\n- cc\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB\n- Bb\n- bB\n- bb\n\nBut since C and B are independent, the four phenotypes are combinations of these. However, the phenotypes aren't simply additive but rather multiplicative based on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Since each bird is a dihybrid, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But that might not apply here because the question seems to focus on specific phenotypes like checkered red, etc., rather than the general ratio. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c for the color gene B, and the plain color is determined by the recessive allele b for the pigment gene C. Also, the dominant alleles are C for pigment and B for color.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation will have four phenotypic classes corresponding to the combinations of C and B being dominant or recessive. As I thought earlier, each combination has a probability of 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 18. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 total 16. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 total 16. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 total 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 total 16.\n\nHmm, but according to my calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, totaling 16 if we assume a large population. But looking at option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, the total is 16. That matches my expectation. So, does that mean the correct answer is G?\n\nWait, but why would some phenotypes not appear? Because maybe certain combinations don't manifest due to incomplete dominance or other factors. But the question specifies that the dominant alleles are present, and the recessive are absent. So perhaps all four phenotypes do appear, each at 25%.\n\nBut why is option G the one presented? Let me see the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK. Looking at K, which isn't shown. From the user's message, he provided J as \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Totaling 12, which is less than 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which totals 16. But none of the options exactly match 25% except G. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation isn't 1:1:1:1 because some combinations may not be possible. Let me think differently. Maybe the F2 generation includes only those where both traits are expressed, but that doesn't change the phenotypic ratio much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations regardless of whether they express the trait. In that case, each phenotype would indeed have 25% occurrence, making the ratio 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. If each phenotype were equally represented, each should be 4. But in reality, perhaps some phenotypes don't appear because they require certain genotypes that aren't possible. Wait, but according to the dihybrid cross, all four phenotypes should be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers only the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones, but that wouldn't make sense because the recessive alleles would be absent, leading to the other phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the actual counts based on the F2 generation. The F1 generation is CcBb. When selfed, each allele is equally likely to go to each gamete. So the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB (all dominant, checkered and red)\n2. CC Bb (checkered and brown)\n3. CC bb (checkered and plain)\n4. Cc BB (painted red and brown)\n5. Cc Bb (painted red and plain)\n6. Cc bb (painted red and plain)\n7. cc BB (plain and brown)\n8. cc Bb (plain and brown)\n9. cc bb (plain and plain)\n\nWait, but no, this approach is missing something. The correct way is to consider all possible combinations. Actually, the F2 will have four phenotypes, each with a certain frequency based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having both dominant traits (C_ and B_) is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4. Similarly for the others. So each phenotype occurs at 25% probability.\n\nThus, if we consider a large population, each phenotype would be approximately 1/4 of the total. But none of the answer options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option G shows checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, totaling 16. This aligns with a 1:1:1:1 ratio, assuming each phenotype appears equally often. Therefore, option G must be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So let's calculate the number of each phenotype:",
    "rollout": " So let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Total F2 population: Assuming each gamete contributes equally, the F2 population is 1/4 for each of the four phenotypic combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014since each gene is segregating independently, the number of each phenotype is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) is (probability C present) * (probability B present) = (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9. Similarly, pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9. Plain red (c and B present) is (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9. Plain brown (c and B absent) is (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene's expression isn't multiplicative like that. Actually, the probability of each phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Probability = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 c recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nSo the total is 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 1. Correct. Now, converting these fractions into ratios, we get 4:2:2:1. Adding them up gives 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. Now, looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH. 5,3,2,6\nI. 7,5,1,3\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b).\n\nThe presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding trait.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment red (C): 2/3 (dominant) and plain (c): 1/3\n\nFor Body color (B): brown (B): 2/3, checkered (b): 1/3\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n1. C & B \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C & b \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. c & B \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. c & b \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nTotal sum: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the ratios are 4:2:2:1. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let's look again at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum: 16 parts, doesn't fit.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't include 1/9.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum:16, nope.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, no.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the initial parent genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant alleles present \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb (as each parent contributes CB and cb). So F1 is heterozygous for both genes, leading to 25% each genotype.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 would produce the F2 generation as follows:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic distribution is 25% for each combination. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the combinations of the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nAs previously, the ratios should be 4:2:2:1, but looking at the options, perhaps I miscalculated something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of thinking about the F2 as a monohybrid cross, perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross, but the answer expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to create a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure for one gene, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking about the F1 generation rather than F2, but the question specifies F2.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's initial message, the question says \"show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" And the options don't include 4:2:2:1. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the ratio after performing a test cross instead of a regular F2 analysis. A test cross involves crossing an F1 individual with a homozygous recessive parent. In our case, the F1 is CcBb, so a test cross would be CcBb x ccbb.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 ratio would still be 25% for each phenotype. However, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, another angle: If both parents are homozygous, but in a way that affects the outcome. For instance, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for all genes. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi hybrid cross usually refers to a cross between two individuals where one is heterozygous and the other is homozygous recessive. So, for example, a cross like AaBb \u00d7 aaBB.\n\nIn our case, the two parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous dominant for both genes: CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- Parent 2: Homozygous recessive for both genes: cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB gametes. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2 as described earlier.\n\nBut why aren't any of the answer options matching the 4:2:2:1 ratio?\n\nLooking back, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some aspect of the problem.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is referring to the F2 generation without considering all possible phenotypic expressions. Wait, no, the question clearly states F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confused between F1 and F2 generations. Let me confirm:\n\n- F1 is the first generation resulting from crossing the two parents (parents).\n- F2 is the next generation (F1 \u00d7 F1).\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, could the parents be different? The user wrote:\n\n\"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird\"\n\nAh! Wait a minute\u2014is the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (which is homozygous for both recessive alleles, i.e., cc bb?) and a plain brown bird (cc bb)? No, that can't be right because then the F1 would be cc bb \u00d7 cc bb, which would be homozygous for both recessives, leading to all the same phenotype. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous recessive for one trait and the other is heterozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous recessive for one trait and heterozygous for the other. For example, one parent is cc bb (plain brown) and the other is CcBb (heterozygous). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the usual 25% phenotypic ratio. But the user said it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous dominant (for one trait) and the other is homozygous recessive (for the other trait). For example:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment and brown color)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for pigment and plain color)\n\nThen, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the 25% phenotypic ratios. Again, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, unless the user intended to refer to a different scenario. Another thought: Perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation probabilities. But that wouldn't change the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Looking back, option J is phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which adds up to 2+6+3+1=12. Not sure how that comes from the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing F1 with F2, but in reality, F2 is what matters.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the F2 generation. Let me try again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFrom C locus: C and c\nFrom B locus: B and b\n\nSo F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, grouping by phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n   Wait, no. Let me group properly:\n\nWait, each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCalculating the percentages:\n\nPhenotype 1: 25% (CC BB) + 25% (CC Bb) + 25% (CC bb) = 75%? Wait, no, that's incorrect because each genotype represents a specific phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each genotype maps to a specific phenotype, regardless of the count. Wait, no\u2014it's better to think of the percentage of each phenotype based on their occurrence.\n\nActually, in a dihybrid cross, each of the nine possible combinations (from C and B) occurs at 25% frequency except those that combine dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Wait, no\u2014each of the nine possible phenotypic combinations occurs at 1/9 frequency, but considering dominance, the counts might differ.\n\nWait, no, the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Any genotype where C is dominant and B is dominant. This includes CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014no, each individual has their own genotype. Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list all possible phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All individuals where either C is present or B is present. But since both are dominant, it's any individual that has at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n  - CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB \u2192 These six cases have at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\n  However, wait\u2014this is incorrect because some of these may overlap. Let me count:\n\nEach individual has a genotype, which defines their phenotype. For Pigment red (C):\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), Pigment red is expressed.\n- For Brown (B):\n  - If B is present (any B allele), Brown is expressed.\n\nSo, the only phenotype that does NOT occur is when C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb). Because in that case, neither pigment nor color is expressed.\n\nThus, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is the total minus those with cc bb.\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16 (since each gene is independent, 2^2 for each gene, 4 total, 16 total genotypes)\n\nNumber of individuals with Pigment red and Brown: 16 - 1 = 15? Wait, no\u2014because each individual's phenotype depends on their genotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me see:\n\nEach individual's genotype determines their phenotype. For Pigment red (C):\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), Pigment red is expressed.\n- For Brown (B):\n\n  - If B is present (either B or b), Brown is expressed.\n  - If B is absent (bb), Brown is not expressed.\n\nTherefore, the only phenotype that does not exist is when both C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb). All other combinations have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Pigment red and Brown are expressed.\n\nTherefore, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is 16 - 1 = 15? Wait, that can't be right because each individual is represented once in the Punnett square, so 16 individuals. One individual (cc bb) lacks both, so 15 have either Pigment red or Brown. Wait, but actually, all 15 have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Pigment red and Brown are present in 15 cases. But that contradicts the previous idea that only 15 out of 16 have both Pigment red and Brown. Wait, no\u2014actually, no\u2014if both Pigment red and Brown are expressed, then all 16 individuals must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Because:\n\n- If an individual has C present (so Pigment red), they will always have Pigment red, regardless of B.\n\n- Similarly, if B is present (Brown), they will have Brown regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the only exception is when both C and B are absent (cc bb), which results in neither Pigment red nor Brown.\n\nThus, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is 16 - 1 = 15, and the rest (1) have neither. But wait, that would mean 15 individuals with both Pigment red and Brown, which can't be right because in reality, each individual has a unique genotype, so the number of Phenotype 1 individuals is 15, and Phenotype 4 is 1.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the initial thought that the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. Therefore, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, which would incorrectly assign all individuals to Phenotype 1, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the terms.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Total F2 population: Assuming each gamete contributes equally, the F2 population is 1/4 for each of the four phenotypic combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014since each gene is segregating independently, the number of each phenotype is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) is (probability C present) * (probability B present) = (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9. Similarly, pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9. Plain red (c and B present) is (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9. Plain brown (c and B absent) is (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene's expression isn't multiplicative like that. Actually, the probability of each phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Probability = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 c recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nSo the total is 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 1. Correct. Now, converting these fractions into ratios, we get 4:2:2:1. Adding them up gives 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. Now, looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH. 5,3,2,6\nI. 7,5,1,3\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b).\n\nThe presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding trait.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment red (C): 2/3 (dominant) and plain (c): 1/3\n\nFor Body color (B): brown (B): 2/3, checkered (b): 1/3\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n1. C & B \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C & b \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. c & B \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. c & b \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nTotal sum: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the ratios are 4:2:2:1. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let's look again at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum: 16 parts, doesn't fit.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't include 1/9.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum:16, nope.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, no.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the initial parent genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant alleles present \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb (as each parent contributes CB and cb). So F1 is heterozygous for both genes, leading to 25% each genotype.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 would produce the F2 generation as follows:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic distribution is 25% for each combination. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the combinations of the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nAs previously, the ratios should be 4:2:2:1, but looking at the options, perhaps I miscalculated something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of thinking about the F2 as a monohybrid cross, perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross, but the answer expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to create a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure for one gene, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking about the F1 generation rather than F2, but the question specifies F2.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's initial message, the question says \"show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" And the options don't include 4:2:2:1. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the ratio after performing a test cross instead of a regular F2 analysis. A test cross involves crossing an F1 individual with a homozygous recessive parent. In our case, the F1 is CcBb, so a test cross would be CcBb x ccbb.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 ratio would still be 25% for each phenotype. However, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, another angle: If both parents are homozygous, but in a way that affects the outcome. For instance, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for all genes. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi hybrid cross usually refers to a cross between two individuals where one is heterozygous and the other is homozygous recessive. So, for example, a cross like AaBb \u00d7 aaBB.\n\nIn our case, the two parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous dominant for both genes: CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- Parent 2: Homozygous recessive for both genes: cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB gametes. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield F2 as described earlier.\n\nBut why aren't any of the answer options matching the 4:2:2:1 ratio?\n\nLooking back, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some aspect of the problem.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is referring to the F2 generation without considering all possible phenotypic expressions. Wait, no, the question clearly states F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confused between F1 and F2 generations. Let me confirm:\n\n- F1 is the first generation resulting from crossing the two parents (parents).\n- F2 is the next generation (F1 \u00d7 F1).\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, could the parents be different? The user wrote:\n\n\"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird\"\n\nAh! Wait a minute\u2014is the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (which is homozygous for both recessive alleles, i.e., cc bb?) and a plain brown bird (cc bb)? No, that can't be right because then the F1 would be cc bb \u00d7 cc bb, which would be homozygous for both recessives, leading to all the same phenotype. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous recessive for one trait and the other is heterozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous recessive for one trait and heterozygous for the other. For example, one parent is cc bb (plain brown) and the other is CcBb (heterozygous). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the usual 25% phenotypic ratio. But the user said it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous dominant (for one trait) and the other is homozygous recessive (for the other trait). For example:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment and brown color)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for pigment and plain color)\n\nThen, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the 25% phenotypic ratios. Again, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, unless the user intended to refer to a different scenario. Another thought: Perhaps the F2 generation refers to the dihybrid cross without considering the actual segregation probabilities. But that wouldn't change the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Looking back, option J is phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which adds up to 2+6+3+1=12. Not sure how that comes from the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing F1 with F2, but in reality, F2 is what matters.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the F2 generation. Let me try again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFrom C locus: C and c\nFrom B locus: B and b\n\nSo F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, grouping by phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n   Wait, no. Let me group properly:\n\nWait, each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nCalculating the percentages:\n\nPhenotype 1: 25% (CC BB) + 25% (CC Bb) + 25% (CC bb) = 75%? Wait, no, that's incorrect because each genotype represents a specific phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each genotype maps to a specific phenotype, regardless of the count. Wait, no\u2014it's better to think of the percentage of each phenotype based on their occurrence.\n\nActually, in a dihybrid cross, each of the nine possible combinations (from C and B) occurs at 25% frequency except those that combine dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. Wait, no\u2014each of the nine possible phenotypic combinations occurs at 1/9 frequency, but considering dominance, the counts might differ.\n\nWait, no, the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Any genotype where C is dominant and B is dominant. This includes CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014no, each individual has their own genotype. Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me list all possible phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All individuals where either C is present or B is present. But since both are dominant, it's any individual that has at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n  - CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB \u2192 These six cases have at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\n  However, wait\u2014this is incorrect because some of these may overlap. Let me count:\n\nEach individual has a genotype, which defines their phenotype. For Pigment red (C):\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), Pigment red is expressed.\n- For Brown (B):\n  - If B is present (any B allele), Brown is expressed.\n\nSo, the only phenotype that does NOT occur is when C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb). Because in that case, neither pigment nor color is expressed.\n\nThus, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is the total minus those with cc bb.\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16 (since each gene is independent, 2^2 for each gene, 4 total, 16 total genotypes)\n\nNumber of individuals with Pigment red and Brown: 16 - 1 = 15? Wait, no\u2014because each individual's phenotype depends on their genotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me see:\n\nEach individual's genotype determines their phenotype. For Pigment red (C):\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), Pigment red is expressed.\n- For Brown (B):\n\n  - If B is present (either B or b), Brown is expressed.\n  - If B is absent (bb), Brown is not expressed.\n\nTherefore, the only phenotype that does not exist is when both C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb). All other combinations have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Pigment red and Brown are expressed.\n\nTherefore, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is 16 - 1 = 15? Wait, that can't be right because each individual is represented once in the Punnett square, so 16 individuals. One individual (cc bb) lacks both, so 15 have either Pigment red or Brown. Wait, but actually, all 15 have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so both Pigment red and Brown are present in 15 cases. But that contradicts the previous idea that only 15 out of 16 have both Pigment red and Brown. Wait, no\u2014actually, no\u2014if both Pigment red and Brown are expressed, then all 16 individuals must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Because:\n\n- If an individual has C present (so Pigment red), they will always have Pigment red, regardless of B.\n\n- Similarly, if B is present (Brown), they will have Brown regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the only exception is when both C and B are absent (cc bb), which results in neither Pigment red nor Brown.\n\nThus, the number of individuals with Pigment red and Brown is 16 - 1 = 15, and the rest (1) have neither. But wait, that would mean 15 individuals with both Pigment red and Brown, which can't be right because in reality, each individual has a unique genotype, so the number of Phenotype 1 individuals is 15, and Phenotype 4 is 1.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the initial thought that the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. Therefore, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, which would incorrectly assign all individuals to Phenotype 1, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the terms.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. However, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (C from F1 gamete CB, C from another CB)\n   - Phenotype: Pigment red (since C is dominant), B is present (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. Cc (C from CB, c from cb)\n   - Pigment red (C dominant), B is present (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n3. cc (c from cb, c from cb)\n   - Pigment plain (c), B is absent (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered\n4. bb (b from cb, b from cb)\n   - Pigment plain (b), B is absent (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered\n\nBut wait, that's only four phenotypes. However, the presence of multiple traits can lead to different ratios. Since each trait is independent, the number of possible phenotypes is 3 (for pigment) * 3 (for color) = 9? No, wait\u2014no, each bird has two traits, so the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown\n- Pigment red and checkered\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these is a unique phenotype, leading to four possible phenotypic classes. However, some may overlap. For example, if both traits are expressed, it's one phenotype, but if only one is expressed, it's another. But in reality, each bird would have a specific combination, so there are four phenotypic classes.\n\nNow, the probability for each class depends on the combination of the two genes. For each trait, the probability is as follows:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Presence (red): 3/4 (since C is dominant, and the bird could have CC, Cc, or any genotype where C is present)\n- Absence (plain): 1/4 (only cc)\n\nFor color (B):\n- Presence (brown): 3/4 (similar logic)\n- Absence (checkered): 1/4\n\nHowever, since both traits are determined independently, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present (Red and Brown): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Pigment present, color absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain, color present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Both traits absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to each class.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene is independent, the overall phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nSo for the C locus: \n- Presence of C (red) = probability = 1/2 (since C is dominant)\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is homozygous (CC), then regardless of the other gene, it's red. If heterozygous (Cc), then it's red. If it's cc, then plain. Similarly for B locus: presence of B (brown) = 1/2, else checkered.\n\nSince the genes are linked, but in this problem, I don't think linkage is considered\u2014it\u2019s about independent assortment. So each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. However, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (C from F1 gamete CB, C from another CB)\n   - Phenotype: Pigment red (since C is dominant), B is present (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. Cc (C from CB, c from cb)\n   - Pigment red (C dominant), B is present (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n3. cc (c from cb, c from cb)\n   - Pigment plain (c), B is absent (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered\n4. bb (b from cb, b from cb)\n   - Pigment plain (b), B is absent (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered\n\nBut wait, that's only four phenotypes. However, the presence of multiple traits can lead to different ratios. Since each trait is independent, the number of possible phenotypes is 3 (for pigment) * 3 (for color) = 9? No, wait\u2014no, each bird has two traits, so the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown\n- Pigment red and checkered\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these is a unique phenotype, leading to four possible phenotypic classes.

    "rollout": " Let me approach this systematically:\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being present (dominant) or absent (recessive). Since the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for C and B:\n- Both dominant (C and B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n- C dominant, B recessive (C and b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered\n- C recessive, B dominant (c and B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n- Both recessive (c and b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"the checkered pattern\" as controlled by the recessive allele c. So the presence of 'c' in either gene leads to the checkered pattern. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, according to Mendel's laws, assuming independent assortment and no linkage, the probability for each phenotype is 25% for each of the four combinations.\n\nHowever, looking at the options given, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which isn't matching our calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual F2 ratio doesn't follow 1:1:1:1. Let me re-examine. If each gene has a 50% chance, then for each gene, the phenotype is determined by dominance. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotype ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 phenotypes. But none of the options match exactly, except option D. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which suggests a different approach. Perhaps the way the genes interact affects the phenotype differently. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the presence of dominant alleles across both genes as the phenotype, but I don't see how that changes anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a scenario where the presence of dominant alleles in both genes results in one phenotype, but that seems unlikely given the description. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each type of bird based on their genetic makeup rather than their phenotypes directly. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So it's about the phenotypes, not the genotypes. Therefore, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. So with 25% chance for each, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, totaling 4 parts. However, the options don't reflect that. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is 1+3+9+3=16 parts, suggesting a different approach. Maybe the question is considering the combination of both genes for each bird, such as \"how many have both genes dominant,\" \"both recessive,\" etc., but that still wouldn't change the count of phenotypes unless the question counts them as separate phenotypes regardless of the actual combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype for each trait, but in reality, each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird's phenotype is based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence or absence of C and B, leading to four possible phenotypes as before. Therefore, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which is 4 phenotypic categories, each with equal frequency. None of the answer choices seem to align with this, except perhaps if the question is referring to the number of birds with each specific combination, but that's not what the question asks.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, which suggests that the question is counting the number of birds with each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles, rather than the phenotypic ratio. For example, checkered red could mean having c and c (since c is recessive) plus B and B. Similarly, checkered brown would be c and c plus B and B, but that doesn't make sense because c is recessive. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific combination of alleles, leading to certain phenotypes, but the options suggest a different breakdown.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category based on the F2 generation. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c present \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, each phenotype occurs with a probability of 25%, leading to four phenotypic classes. However, the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 distribution. Instead, they sum to 16, implying perhaps a different consideration.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds in each phenotype category, irrespective of their genotype. Since each bird has a 25% chance to fall into each phenotype category, the expected counts would be 16 birds divided equally among four phenotypes, resulting in 4 birds per phenotype. But none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype within the phenotype group. For example:\n\n- For checkered red: phenotype is checkered and red.\nThis would require both recessive alleles (c) for pigment and recessive for body (b). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it must have at least one recessive allele for pigment (c). So for checkered red, the bird must have c for pigment and B for body (since red is dominant).\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would require c for pigment and b for body (b causes brown).\n\nPlain red requires C (dominant) for pigment and B for body.\n\nPlain brown requires C for pigment and b for body.\n\nTherefore, the number of birds in each phenotype group would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of F2 population\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAssuming 16 birds in total (since 16 = 4^2), each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, none of the options match this. Looking at the options again, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, adding up to 16. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype, not the phenotype. For example, checkered red might refer to having at least one recessive allele (so c for pigment and B for body), while plain red would have at least one dominant allele (C for pigment and B for body).\n\nIn that case, the number of birds with each genotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (cB): 25% of F2, i.e., 4 birds\n- Checkered brown (cb): 25% of F2, i.e., 4 birds\n- Plain red (CC or Cc): 50% of F2, i.e., 8 birds\n- Plain brown (cc or cb): 50% of F2, i.e., 8 birds\n\nBut the options don't have 4,4,8,8. They have 1,3,9,3. Which doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype without considering the phenotype grouping, but that would lead to 8 birds with each genotype, which doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene separately. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: c and B \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- Checkered brown: c and b \u2192 another 1/4\n- Plain red: C and B \u2192 another 1/4\n- Plain brown: c and c (for pigment) and b and b (for body)? Wait, no\u2014that's impossible. Because if both alleles are recessive, then both B and b would be present, which contradicts the definition of the recessive allele. Actually, the presence of even one recessive allele would make the bird non-checkered. So, checkered would require at least one recessive allele for pigment and at least one recessive allele for body. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: cb \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: CC or Cc \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc \u2192 25%\n\nBut again, the numbers would be 4,4,8,4, which doesn't match any option. Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look at the options provided and determine which makes sense based on standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nThe most straightforward Mendelian ratio when two genes are acting independently is 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. However, none of the options reflect this. Option D, for instance, shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. These numbers suggest that the checkered phenotype is rare, followed by plain red, and vice versa. This might imply that the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype, grouped by phenotype, but without accounting for dominance properly. For example, if the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one, but that's not how dominance works\u2014it's additive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly interpreting the F2 ratio. If we consider that each gene has a 50% chance of contributing a dominant or recessive allele, then the expected number of each phenotype would be proportional to the number of ways each trait can be expressed. For instance, checkered red would require at least one recessive allele for pigment and at least one recessive for body. The number of such birds would be 25% of the total F2 population. If the F2 population is 16 birds, this would be 4 birds. Similarly for the others. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D, based on the assumption that the checkered phenotype is less common due to the interaction of both genes in determining the phenotype, but this reasoning isn't clear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype group based on the actual phenotypic expressions, ignoring the underlying genotype probabilities beyond the dominant/recessive ratios. \n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the possible scenarios, the most plausible answer based on Mendelian ratios and typical textbook problems is option D. It provides a balanced distribution that accounts for the dominance of each allele, albeit in a way that seems counterintuitive at first glance.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me approach this systematically:\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being present (dominant) or absent (recessive). Since the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo for C and B:\n- Both dominant (C and B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n- C dominant, B recessive (C and b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered\n- C recessive, B dominant (c and B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n- Both recessive (c and b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"the checkered pattern\" as controlled by the recessive allele c. So the presence of 'c' in either gene leads to the checkered pattern. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, according to Mendel's laws, assuming independent assortment and no linkage, the probability for each phenotype is 25% for each of the four combinations.\n\nHowever, looking at the options given, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which isn't matching our calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual F2 ratio doesn't follow 1:1:1:1. Let me re-examine. If each gene has a 50% chance, then for each gene, the phenotype is determined by dominance. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotype ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 phenotypes. But none of the options match exactly, except option D. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which suggests a different approach. Perhaps the way the genes interact affects the phenotype differently. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the presence of dominant alleles across both genes as the phenotype, but I don't see how that changes anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to a scenario where the presence of dominant alleles in both genes results in one phenotype, but that seems unlikely given the description. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each type of bird based on their genetic makeup rather than their phenotypes directly. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So it's about the phenotypes, not the genotypes. Therefore, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. So with 25% chance for each, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, totaling 4 parts. However, the options don't reflect that. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is 1+3+9+3=16 parts, suggesting a different approach. Maybe the question is considering the combination of both genes for each bird, such as \"how many have both genes dominant,\" \"both recessive,\" etc., but that still wouldn't change the count of phenotypes unless the question counts them as separate phenotypes regardless of the actual combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the presence of any dominant allele as the phenotype for each trait, but in reality, each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird's phenotype is based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence or absence of C and B, leading to four possible phenotypes as before. Therefore, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which is 4 phenotypic categories, each with equal frequency. None of the answer choices seem to align with this, except perhaps if the question is referring to the number of birds with each specific combination, but that's not what the question asks.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, which suggests that the question is counting the number of birds with each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles, rather than the phenotypic ratio. For example, checkered red could mean having c and c (since c is recessive) plus B and B. Similarly, checkered brown would be c and c plus B and B, but that doesn't make sense because c is recessive. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific combination of alleles, leading to certain phenotypes, but the options suggest a different breakdown.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category based on the F2 generation. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c present \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b present \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, each phenotype occurs with a probability of 25%, leading to four phenotypic classes. However, the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 distribution. Instead, they sum to 16, implying perhaps a different consideration.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds in each phenotype category, irrespective of their genotype. Since each bird has a 25% chance to fall into each phenotype category, the expected counts would be 16 birds divided equally among four phenotypes, resulting in 4 birds per phenotype. But none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype within the phenotype group. For example:\n\n- For checkered red: phenotype is checkered and red.\nThis would require both recessive alleles (c) for pigment and recessive for body (b). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it must have at least one recessive allele for pigment (c). So for checkered red, the bird must have c for pigment and B for body (since red is dominant).\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would require c for pigment and b for body (b causes brown).\n\nPlain red requires C (dominant) for pigment and B for body.\n\nPlain brown requires C for pigment and b for body.\n\nTherefore, the number of birds in each phenotype group would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of F2 population\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAssuming 16 birds in total (since 16 = 4^2), each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, none of the options match this. Looking at the options again, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, adding up to 16. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype, not the phenotype. For example, checkered red might refer to having at least one recessive allele (so c for pigment and B for body), while plain red would have at least one dominant allele (C for pigment and B for body).\n\nIn that case, the number of birds with each genotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (cB): 25% of F2, i.e., 4 birds\n- Checkered brown (cb): 25% of F2, i.e., 4 birds\n- Plain red (CC or Cc): 50% of F2, i.e., 8 birds\n- Plain brown (cc or cb): 50% of F2, i.e., 8 birds\n\nBut the options don't have 4,4,8,8. They have 1,3,9,3. Which doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype without considering the phenotype grouping, but that would lead to 8 birds with each genotype, which doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene separately. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: c and B \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- Checkered brown: c and b \u2192 another 1/4\n- Plain red: C and B \u2192 another 1/4\n- Plain brown: c and c (for pigment) and b and b (for body)? Wait, no\u2014that's impossible. Because if both alleles are recessive, then both B and b would be present, which contradicts the definition of the recessive allele. Actually, the presence of even one recessive allele would make the bird non-checkered. So, checkered would require at least one recessive allele for pigment and at least one recessive allele for body. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: cb \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: CC or Cc \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc \u2192 25%\n\nBut again, the numbers would be 4,4,8,4, which doesn't match any option. Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look at the options provided and determine which makes sense based on standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nThe most straightforward Mendelian ratio when two genes are acting independently is 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. However, none of the options reflect this. Option D, for instance, shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. These numbers suggest that the checkered phenotype is rare, followed by plain red, and vice versa. This might imply that the question is considering the number of birds with each specific genotype, grouped by phenotype, but without accounting for dominance properly. For example, if the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one, but that's not how dominance works\u2014it's additive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly interpreting the F2 ratio. If we consider that each gene has a 50% chance of contributing a dominant or recessive allele, then the expected number of each phenotype would be proportional to the number of ways each trait can be expressed. For instance, checkered red would require at least one recessive allele for pigment and at least one recessive for body. The number of such birds would be 25% of the total F2 population. If the F2 population is 16 birds, this would be 4 birds. Similarly for the others. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D, based on the assumption that the checkered phenotype is less common due to the interaction of both genes in determining the phenotype, but this reasoning isn't clear.

Checking option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Total is 16, which doesn't make sense because 4+4+4+4=16, but each should be 25% of the F2 population. Wait, but the F2 population size isn't specified. Hmm, perhaps the answer depends on the number of offspring produced, but without knowing the total number, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. The F1 will be CcBb, and then F1 selfing results in four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%. So the phenotypic ratios for each bird would be 25% for each combination of C/B traits. Now, how many phenotypic categories do we have?\n\nFor the C locus: Red (C) or plain (c)\nFor the B locus: Brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered Red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered Brown\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these should occur at 25% frequency. However, looking at the options, none directly state 25% each. Instead, some options group them into different counts. Maybe I need to consider how many offspring fall into each category based on the actual genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual F2 genotypes, regardless of the specific letters. Let me try that.\n\nThe F2 individuals will be CcBb, and when crossed, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: All checkered red (phenotype: Checkered Red)\n- CC bb: All plain brown (Checkered Brown)\n- cc BB: All checkered red (Plain Red)\n- cc bb: All plain brown (Plain Brown)\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the F2 will also include other combinations due to the law of segregation. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. So the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB gametes:\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nSimilarly, from cb gametes:\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CcBb (25%)\n2. Ccbb (25%)\n3. ccBb (25%)\n4. ccbb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo each of these four phenotypes will occur at 25% frequency in the F2 generation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So, for the C locus: 50% C (dominant, red) and 50% c (recessive, plain). For the B locus: 50% B (dominant, brown) and 50% b (recessive, checkered). Since the two loci are independent, the phenotypic ratios would be 25% for each combination. That is, 25% for (C,B), 25% for (C,b), 25% for (c,B), and 25% for (c,b). Now, mapping these to the given options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, but according to our earlier reasoning, each phenotypic category should occur at 25%, so the totals should add up to 100%. Checking option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Total is 16, which doesn't make sense because 4+4+4+4=16, but each should be 25% of the F2 population. Wait, but the F2 population size isn't specified. Hmm, perhaps the answer depends on the number of offspring produced, but without knowing the total number, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. The F1 will be CcBb, and then F1 selfing results in four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%. So the phenotypic ratios for each bird would be 25% for each combination of C/B traits. Now, how many phenotypic categories do we have?\n\nFor the C locus: Red (C) or plain (c)\nFor the B locus: Brown (B) or checkered (b)\n\nSo four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered Red\n2. Pigment Red (C) and Checkered (b): Checkered Brown\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these should occur at 25% frequency. However, looking at the options, none directly state 25% each. Instead, some options group them into different counts. Maybe I need to consider how many offspring fall into each category based on the actual genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual F2 genotypes, regardless of the specific letters. Let me try that.\n\nThe F2 individuals will be CcBb, and when crossed, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: All checkered red (phenotype: Checkered Red)\n- CC bb: All plain brown (Checkered Brown)\n- cc BB: All checkered red (Plain Red)\n- cc bb: All plain brown (Plain Brown)\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the F2 will also include other combinations due to the law of segregation. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. So the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB gametes:\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nSimilarly, from cb gametes:\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CcBb (25%)\n2. Ccbb (25%)\n3. ccBb (25%)\n4. ccbb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo each of these four phenotypes will occur at 25% frequency in the F2 generation. If we assume a large enough population, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 1:1:1:1. However, since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the question is referring to the count of each phenotype among the offspring, depending on the number of test crosses or something else. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each trait is expressed independently, leading to four possible phenotypes, each with 25% chance.\n\nBut looking back at the options, let me see what each represents:\n\nOption H says Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

C_ (red) and b_ (checkered): red-checkered\n3. c_ (plain) and B_ (brown): plain-brown\n4. c_ (plain) and b_ (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of being red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant, any genotype where at least one C is present: CC, Cc, Cc, Cc; wait, no, wait: for a single gene, if the bird is Cc, then the probability of having at least one dominant allele (C) is 3/4, because the possible alleles are C and c, and only the cc genotype results in recessive, which is 1/4.

Because each bird has two traits, and the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So the actual number of possible phenotypes isn't four like I thought earlier; rather, each bird has a specific phenotype based on both traits.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So for the C locus, the phenotype is red if C is present, else plain. For the B locus, brown if B is present, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype can be determined by checking both traits. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (red and brown)\n2. Pigment expressed, but checkered body (red and checkered)\n3. Plain color, brown body (plain and brown)\n4. Plain color, checkered body (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene's expression is independent, so the overall phenotype frequency is the product of each gene's expression probability.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes equally, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CB \u2192 presence of C (C_: red)\n- cb \u2192 presence of c (C_: plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- CB \u2192 presence of B (B_: brown)\n- cb \u2192 presence of b (B_: checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C_ (red) and B_ (brown): red-brown\n2. C_ (red) and b_ (checkered): red-checkered\n3. c_ (plain) and B_ (brown): plain-brown\n4. c_ (plain) and b_ (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. For example, the probability of being red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant, any genotype where at least one C is present: CC, Cc, Cc, Cc; wait, no, wait: for a single gene, if the bird is Cc, then the probability of having at least one dominant allele (C) is 3/4, because the possible alleles are C and c, and only the cc genotype results in recessive, which is 1/4. Similarly for B: B is dominant, so B_ is 3/4 chance.\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the combined probability is the product of each gene's probability. So for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red-brown: (probability C_ * probability B_)\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nWait, but hold on, that's not quite right. Because each bird has two traits, and the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So the actual number of possible phenotypes isn't four like I thought earlier; rather, each bird has a specific phenotype based on both traits. So, in reality, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of the two traits:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if both C_ and B_ are present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C_ and b_)\n- Plain red and brown (if c_ and B_)\n- Plain red and checkered (if c_ and b_)\n\nSo now, how many birds in the F2 generation fall into each category?\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb, so F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, each F1 bird can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So the F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n1. From CB + CB: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. From CB + cb: CcBb + CcbBb \u2192 Phenotype: C_ (red) and b_ (checkered) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. From cb + CB: same as above \u2192 red-checkered\n4. From cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: c_ (plain) and b_ (checkered) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but actually, the F2 will have the following:\n\nThe possible genotypes after selfing:\n\n- 25% CC (all C)\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a single gene. But since there are two genes, the F2 will have a grid of possible genotypes:\n\n- For C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nBut each can combine, leading to nine possible phenotypes, but given dominance, some may merge into fewer categories. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So for the C locus, the phenotype is red if C is present, else plain. For the B locus, brown if B is present, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype can be determined by checking both traits. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (red and brown)\n2. Pigment expressed, but checkered body (red and checkered)\n3. Plain color, brown body (plain and brown)\n4. Plain color, checkered body (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene's expression is independent, so the overall phenotype frequency is the product of each gene's expression probability.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Red and Brown: Both C_ and B_ present.\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Red and Checkered: C_ and b_ present.\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of b_: 1/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and Brown: c_ and B_ present.\n   - Probability of c_: 1/4\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and Checkered: c_ and b_ present.\n   - Probability of c_: 1/4\n   - Probability of b_: 1/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain-Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That matches our calculation exactly. So the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But let me verify. Each gene has two possible phenotypes, so combined, there are 2x2=4 phenotypic combinations. Each combination occurs at a certain frequency. The F2 from a dihybrid cross (which itself comes from a monohybrid cross) follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, but the original cross here isn't a dihybrid; it's a dihybrid cross because the parents are homozygous for both genes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2. But the F2 will indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So let me calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- 9/16 chance for one specific phenotype\n- 3/16 for another, and similarly for the others.\n\nBut wait, what defines each phenotype? Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_): This occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant.\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb): C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain and brown (c_B_): c recessive, B dominant.\n4. Plain and checkered (c_bb): c recessive, B recessive.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has a 25% chance of being present (for pigment) and a 75% chance of being absent (plain) for the first gene, and similarly for the second gene. Wait, no\u2014the actual probabilities are calculated as follows: For each gene, the probability of the dominant trait (C or B) is higher than the recessive (c or b).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to model the probabilities directly. For each bird, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 75%, and checkered (c) is 25%. Similarly, the probability of having brown color (B) is 75%, and plain (b) is 25%.\n\nThe four possible phenotypes correspond to the combinations of these traits. To find the exact counts, we can use the formula for dihybrid crosses: the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, where each part corresponds to the four phenotypic classes. However, depending on whether the traits are independent, the numbers might differ slightly due to dominance. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the 9:3:3:1 ratio holds.\n\nSo, applying this, the number of each phenotype in the F2 would be approximately:\n\n- 9 parts for Pigmented red and brown\n- 3 parts for Pigmented red and checkered\n- 3 parts for Plain and brown\n- 1 part for Plain and checkered\n\nTotaling 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but let me see the options:\n\nA.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that both genes are dominant-recessive, and the parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s when both loci are independent and each has two alleles. In our case, the traits are determined by two separate genes, so the F2 will have 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But let me verify. Each gene has two possible phenotypes, so combined, there are 2x2=4 phenotypic combinations. Each combination occurs at a certain frequency. The F2 from a dihybrid cross (which itself comes from a monohybrid cross) follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, but the original cross here isn't a dihybrid; it's a dihybrid cross because the parents are homozygous for both genes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2. But the F2 will indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So let me calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- 9/16 chance for one specific phenotype\n- 3/16 for another, and similarly for the others.\n\nBut wait, what defines each phenotype? Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_): This occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant.\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb): C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain and brown (c_B_): c recessive, B dominant.\n4. Plain and checkered (c_bb): c recessive, B recessive.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has a 25% chance of being present (for pigment) and a 75% chance of being absent (plain) for the first gene, and similarly for the second gene. Wait, no\u2014the actual probabilities are calculated as follows: For each gene, the probability of the dominant trait (C or B) is higher than the recessive (c or b).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to model the probabilities directly. For each bird, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 75%, and checkered (c) is 25%. Similarly, the probability of having brown color (B) is 75%, and plain (b) is 25%.\n\nThe four possible phenotypes correspond to the combinations of these traits. To find the exact counts, we can use the formula for dihybrid crosses: the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, where each part corresponds to the four phenotypic classes. However, depending on whether the traits are independent, the numbers might differ slightly due to dominance. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the 9:3:3:1 ratio holds.\n\nSo, applying this, the number of each phenotype in the F2 would be approximately:\n\n- 9 parts for Pigmented red and brown\n- 3 parts for Pigmented red and checkered\n- 3 parts for Plain and brown\n- 1 part for Plain and checkered\n\nTotaling 16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly, but let me see the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1.\n\nB.

Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nWait, option K says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense because 12+2+2+0=16, but according to the 9:3:3:1, it should be 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, so that's wrong. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also adds to 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches perfectly.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene has a certain probability of being present in the F2 generation.",
    "rollout": " Each gene has a certain probability of being present in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So let me approach this methodically. First, determine the probabilities for each gene in the F2 generation. Since both genes are controlled by separate loci and are independently assorting, we can calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of having C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since in F2, \u00be of the offspring will have at least one dominant allele)\n- Probability of having c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of having B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of having b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Since each trait is determined independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This occurs when both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): \n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four combinations above.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match our calculation. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 nope. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 close but not matching. Option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 also not matching. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 no. Option A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2013 no. Option B: \"Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\" \u2013 no. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 no. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 no. Option G was not matching, so none seem to fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: since each gene is segregating independently, the combined probabilities are indeed multiplicative. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but how does this translate into actual counts? Assuming a large population, the ratio would hold approximately. However, looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1. Maybe the options are presented differently, such as combining the checkered traits. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. Let me see:\n\nIf the phenotypes are defined as:\n- Checkered red (both checkered and red)\n- Checkered brown (checkered and brown)\n- Plain red (plain and red)\n- Plain brown (plain and brown)\n\nThen, according to our calculations:\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option G, which states \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual count without simplifying, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratios without considering dominance, treating each trait as completely dominant. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 red\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 red\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 plain\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 plain\n\nThe probabilities would then be different. If each trait is completely dominant, then the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:3:1:1, adding up to 8. But that still doesn't match any of the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominance in each trait separately, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But none of the options match this. Looking back, option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which sums to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option D labels them as plain red and plain brown, which might be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 9:3:3:1, but presented differently.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"phenotype ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the intended answer is 9:3:3:1, but expressed differently. None of the options seem to match exactly, but option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which adds up to 16, but it's presenting 12,2,2,0. Maybe that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to ignore the dominance and assume complete dominance, leading to a 3:3:1:1 ratio, but that doesn't add up either.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. It says, \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no, that's already stated. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. But that would require knowing the actual counts in the F2 generation, which depends on the number of offspring. Without knowing the starting population size, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the question may expect the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype, regardless of the underlying genetics.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include that. Option G presents a ratio where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That suggests that in the F2 generation, there are no plain brown birds, which contradicts our earlier calculation unless some genetic constraints prevent that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered pattern is a dominant trait, so any bird with at least one 'c' allele would be plain or something else. Wait, no\u2014the question defines checkered as recessive (cc), and plain as recessive (cc). Wait, no: the question says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's conflicting because if C is dominant, then having even one C allele would make the bird red, and having any c allele would make it plain. Similarly, B is dominant brown, and b is plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. The question says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, if you have at least one C allele, the bird is red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if you have at least one b allele, the bird is brown; otherwise, it's plain brown. Wait, that changes things significantly. Because now, the presence of C or B determines the phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant for pigment or color.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B are present)\n2. Pigment red and plain brown (C present, b absent)\n3. Plain and brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and plain brown (c present, b absent)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in this scenario, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the probability of each combination. Given that both genes are acting independently, we can calculate the probabilities as follows.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic expressions:\n- For pigment (C):\n  - Presence (C) \u2192 red\n  - Absence (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - Presence (B) \u2192 brown\n  - Absence (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSince each gene is independent, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Both genes are dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and Plain Brown (b): Pigment dominant, color recessive\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Pigment recessive, color dominant\n4. Plain (c) and Plain Brown (b): Both recessive\n\nThe probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/B):\n- Presence (C): 3/4\n- Absence (c): 1/4\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Plain Brown (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Plain Brown (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, checking the options:\n- Option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\nThis suggests that in the F2 generation, there are no plain brown birds, which conflicts with our calculation where there's a 1/16 chance of plain brown. Unless some genetic constraint prevents this, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in a specific context, like considering only one trait.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that only one trait is under selection, making the others irrelevant. But the question states that both traits are under control, so it's likely that both are considered.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option G comes closest if it's counting in a way that combines multiple categories. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of checkered vs plain for each trait. For example, checkered red and blue versus plain red and blue.\n\nWait, let's clarify what the question is asking for. The question mentions a dihybrid cross involving two genes and asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So, the phenotypic ratio refers to the distribution among all four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Each gene has a certain probability of being present in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So let me approach this methodically. First, determine the probabilities for each gene in the F2 generation. Since both genes are controlled by separate loci and are independently assorting, we can calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of having C (dominant, red) = 3/4 (since in F2, \u00be of the offspring will have at least one dominant allele)\n- Probability of having c (recessive, plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of having B (dominant, brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of having b (recessive, checkered) = 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Since each trait is determined independently, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This occurs when both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): \n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four combinations above.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't match our calculation. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 nope. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 close but not matching. Option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 also not matching. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 no. Option A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2013 no. Option B: \"Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\" \u2013 no. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 no. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 no. Option G was not matching, so none seem to fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: since each gene is segregating independently, the combined probabilities are indeed multiplicative. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but how does this translate into actual counts? Assuming a large population, the ratio would hold approximately. However, looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1. Maybe the options are presented differently, such as combining the checkered traits. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. Let me see:\n\nIf the phenotypes are defined as:\n- Checkered red (both checkered and red)\n- Checkered brown (checkered and brown)\n- Plain red (plain and red)\n- Plain brown (plain and brown)\n\nThen, according to our calculations:\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option G, which states \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual count without simplifying, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratios without considering dominance, treating each trait as completely dominant. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 red\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 red\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 plain\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 plain\n\nThe probabilities would then be different. If each trait is completely dominant, then the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:3:1:1, adding up to 8. But that still doesn't match any of the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the dominance in each trait separately, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But none of the options match this. Looking back, option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which sums to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option D labels them as plain red and plain brown, which might be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 9:3:3:1, but presented differently.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"phenotype ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the intended answer is 9:3:3:1, but expressed differently. None of the options seem to match exactly, but option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which adds up to 16, but it's presenting 12,2,2,0. Maybe that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to ignore the dominance and assume complete dominance, leading to a 3:3:1:1 ratio, but that doesn't add up either.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. It says, \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no, that's already stated. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. But that would require knowing the actual counts in the F2 generation, which depends on the number of offspring. Without knowing the starting population size, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the question may expect the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype, regardless of the underlying genetics.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include that. Option G presents a ratio where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That suggests that in the F2 generation, there are no plain brown birds, which contradicts our earlier calculation unless some genetic constraints prevent that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered pattern is a dominant trait, so any bird with at least one 'c' allele would be plain or something else. Wait, no\u2014the question defines checkered as recessive (cc), and plain as recessive (cc). Wait, no: the question says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's conflicting because if C is dominant, then having even one C allele would make the bird red, and having any c allele would make it plain. Similarly, B is dominant brown, and b is plain brown. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. The question says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, if you have at least one C allele, the bird is red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if you have at least one b allele, the bird is brown; otherwise, it's plain brown. Wait, that changes things significantly. Because now, the presence of C or B determines the phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant for pigment or color.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B are present)\n2. Pigment red and plain brown (C present, b absent)\n3. Plain and brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and plain brown (c present, b absent)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in this scenario, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the probability of each combination. Given that both genes are acting independently, we can calculate the probabilities as follows.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic expressions:\n- For pigment (C):\n  - Presence (C) \u2192 red\n  - Absence (c) \u2192 plain\n- For color (B):\n  - Presence (B) \u2192 brown\n  - Absence (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSince each gene is independent, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Both genes are dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and Plain Brown (b): Pigment dominant, color recessive\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Pigment recessive, color dominant\n4. Plain (c) and Plain Brown (b): Both recessive\n\nThe probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/B):\n- Presence (C): 3/4\n- Absence (c): 1/4\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n- Presence (B): 3/4\n- Absence (b): 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Plain Brown (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Plain Brown (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, checking the options:\n- Option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\nThis suggests that in the F2 generation, there are no plain brown birds, which conflicts with our calculation where there's a 1/16 chance of plain brown. Unless some genetic constraint prevents this, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in a specific context, like considering only one trait.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that only one trait is under selection, making the others irrelevant. But the question states that both traits are under control, so it's likely that both are considered.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option G comes closest if it's counting in a way that combines multiple categories. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of checkered vs plain for each trait. For example, checkered red and blue versus plain red and blue.\n\nWait, let's clarify what the question is asking for. The question mentions a dihybrid cross involving two genes and asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So, the phenotypic ratio refers to the distribution among all four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait.",
    "rollout": " Since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait. So for pigment color:\n\n- C (dominant): 3/4 (since C is dominant over c)\n- c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B (dominant): 3/4\n- b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. The options are A through H, each providing different ratios.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio\" but doesn't specify whether it's considering only the number of birds or the actual counts in terms of genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation. If that's the case, then from the Punnett square approach, where F1 is CcBb and F2 is F1 x F1, leading to four types of F2 birds: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (0%). Wait, that seems off because F2 shouldn't have zero percentage unless something is wrong. Actually, in F2, all four genotypes are possible, each occurring at 25% frequency. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the phenotypes, not the genotypes. So, using the probabilities I calculated earlier, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this directly. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but scaled differently. Wait, no, because 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, while option D shows 1:3:9:3 which also sums to 16. Wait, but my calculation was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E, but option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is equivalent to 9:27:81:27 when multiplied by 9, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is CcBb, and F2 would involve F1 selfing, resulting in F2 genotypes. The phenotypic ratio could be derived from the F2 proportions, considering dominance. Since each trait is determined separately, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't have this exact ratio. Looking back at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is twice what I got. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in how the parents are crossed.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options may group some phenotypes together. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of observed bird types rather than genotypes. But according to standard genetics, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the combination of both traits, hence 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as C\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nOption K:4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nOption L:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G\nOption M:5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\nOption N:7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I\n\nSo all options except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N add up to 16, except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, which sometimes sum to less. Wait, Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total. Similarly, Option E is 3:9:1:3\u2192sum 16. So why isn't any of them matching my calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes. The user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 selfed, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. But wait, in reality, F2 would have all four possible combinations at 25% each, but the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits. Since each trait is determined by a separate gene, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to fit this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypes, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. For the C locus: pigment color. In F2, the possible genotypes are CC (3/4), Cc (1/2), and cc (1/4). For B locus: body color. Possible genotypes are BB (3/4), Bb (1/2), and bb (1/4). Since the two loci assort independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4*1/4)+(1/4*3/4) : (1/4*3/4) : (1/4*1/4) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this. Instead, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reciprocal. Perhaps the user confused the order of phenotypes, but regardless, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user meant to use the F1 phenotypes, but that would lead to a different ratio. Alternatively, maybe the question is missing some details.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation refers to the actual F2 birds, not the F1. So, in that case, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none match exactly. However, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar but reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypic classes differently. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D, assuming the user made a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the parents' genotypes. The user said the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). So F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both traits. Then, F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to four phenotypic classes as before. Hence, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I need to choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the F1 phenotypes, but that's not what the question asks. The question specifically mentions F2 generation. \n\nGiven that, and seeing that option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Another possibility is that the user is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios should account for all possible combinations. Therefore, without any further clarity, I might have to select the option that best fits the calculations, even if it's reversed. However, typically, the phenotypic ratio is presented as the highest to lowest, so 9:3:3:1 would be written as 9,3,3,1, but none of the options do that. Thus, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, I'll proceed to select option D, assuming it's a typo.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait. So for pigment color:\n\n- C (dominant): 3/4 (since C is dominant over c)\n- c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B (dominant): 3/4\n- b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. The options are A through H, each providing different ratios.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio\" but doesn't specify whether it's considering only the number of birds or the actual counts in terms of genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation. If that's the case, then from the Punnett square approach, where F1 is CcBb and F2 is F1 x F1, leading to four types of F2 birds: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (0%). Wait, that seems off because F2 shouldn't have zero percentage unless something is wrong. Actually, in F2, all four genotypes are possible, each occurring at 25% frequency. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the phenotypes, not the genotypes. So, using the probabilities I calculated earlier, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this directly. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, which matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but scaled differently. Wait, no, because 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, while option D shows 1:3:9:3 which also sums to 16. Wait, but my calculation was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E, but option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is equivalent to 9:27:81:27 when multiplied by 9, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is CcBb, and F2 would involve F1 selfing, resulting in F2 genotypes. The phenotypic ratio could be derived from the F2 proportions, considering dominance. Since each trait is determined separately, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't have this exact ratio. Looking back at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is twice what I got. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in how the parents are crossed.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the options may group some phenotypes together. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of observed bird types rather than genotypes. But according to standard genetics, the phenotypic ratio would reflect the combination of both traits, hence 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as C\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nOption K:4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\nOption L:12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G\nOption M:5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\nOption N:7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I\n\nSo all options except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N add up to 16, except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, which sometimes sum to less. Wait, Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is 1+3+9+3=16, matching the total. Similarly, Option E is 3:9:1:3\u2192sum 16. So why isn't any of them matching my calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes. The user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 selfed, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. But wait, in reality, F2 would have all four possible combinations at 25% each, but the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the two traits. Since each trait is determined by a separate gene, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to fit this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead of F2, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypes, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. For the C locus: pigment color. In F2, the possible genotypes are CC (3/4), Cc (1/2), and cc (1/4). For B locus: body color. Possible genotypes are BB (3/4), Bb (1/2), and bb (1/4). Since the two loci assort independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4*1/4)+(1/4*3/4) : (1/4*3/4) : (1/4*1/4) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this. Instead, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reciprocal. Perhaps the user confused the order of phenotypes, but regardless, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps the user meant to use the F1 phenotypes, but that would lead to a different ratio. Alternatively, maybe the question is missing some details.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation refers to the actual F2 birds, not the F1. So, in that case, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none match exactly. However, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar but reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypic classes differently. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D, assuming the user made a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the parents' genotypes. The user said the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). So F1 would be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both traits. Then, F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to four phenotypic classes as before. Hence, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I need to choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the F1 phenotypes, but that's not what the question asks. The question specifically mentions F2 generation. \n\nGiven that, and seeing that option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Another possibility is that the user is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios should account for all possible combinations. Therefore, without any further clarity, I might have to select the option that best fits the calculations, even if it's reversed. However, typically, the phenotypic ratio is presented as the highest to lowest, so 9:3:3:1 would be written as 9,3,3,1, but none of the options do that. Thus, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, I'll proceed to select option D, assuming it's a typo.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me calculate the probabilities:",
    "rollout": " Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele: 75% (since it's homozygous dominant, but wait\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so for each gene, the probability of being at least one dominant allele is 75%, because C is dominant. Similarly, recessive is 25%. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is homozygous dominant for C (CC), then it definitely shows red pigment. If it's heterozygous (Cc), it might show red or some other color depending on B. Wait, but in our case, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will show red. For the B locus, same logic applies.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are based on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of the F2 birds fall into each category. Given that the F2 generation is produced by the cross of F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb), and each F1 can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions (50% each), the F2 will have four possible combinations of CB and cb gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (prob 25%)\n- Ccbb (prob 25%)\n- ccBB (prob 25%)\n- ccbb (prob 25%)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the F2 population isn't just these four genotypes but includes all combinations where each gene's alleles are combined. Actually, the correct way is to consider each gene separately. The F2 for each gene will be:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- Dominant (C) appears in 3/4 of the cases (since 25% are cc)\n- Recessive (c) appears in 1/4\n\nFor B (color):\n- Dominant (B) appears in 3/4 of the cases\n- Recessive (b) appears in 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. However, since each bird has two traits, the actual phenotypic ratios are more complex. Instead, it's better to use a Punnett square approach to list all possible combinations of the F1's gametes.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions. So the F2 will have four possible gamete combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccBb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 should include all possible combinations of the gametes. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (from CB + CB)\n- CcBb (from CB + cb)\n- CcBb (from cb + CB)\n- CcBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n- ccBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n\nWait, no, this seems too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the phenotypes are combinations, the overall ratio depends on the dominance of each trait. Let me instead calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach bird in F2 has two traits: pigment color and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, I'll count the number of F2 individuals that exhibit each combination.\n\nFirst, determine the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nGenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nCC | 25%\nCc | 50%\ncc | 25%\n\nBB | 25%\nBb | 50%\nbb | 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the joint frequencies are products of the individual frequencies. However, for phenotypic ratios, we don't need the exact counts but rather the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of dominant and recessive traits:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype for pigment color is determined by whether C is present, and similarly for B.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the proportion of each phenotype in F2, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of Pigment red = probability of at least one C (C/C, Cc, CC) = 75% (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%, so 25%+50%+25% = 100%). Wait, no\u2014actually, for the C locus, the presence of at least one C means Pigment red. The probability of Pigment red is 75% because it's recessive homozygous (cc) is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, Pigment plain (c) is 25%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Brown (B) is dominant; presence of at least one B means Brown.\n- Probability of Brown = 75% (similar reasoning).\n\nSo the four phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain AND Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the probability of each combination:\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- P(Pigment red) = 75% (probability of at least one C)\n- P(Brown) = 75% (probability of at least one B)\n- P(Pigment plain) = 25% (probability of cc)\n- P(Checkered) = 25% (probability of bb)\n\nNow, for each phenotype combination:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown: Both Pigment red and Brown occur. So P = P(Pigment red) * P(Brown) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered: Pigment red occurs, but Checkered (b) does not. So P = P(Pigment red) * P(B recessive) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n3. Plain AND Brown: Plain (c) occurs, but Brown (B) does not. So P = P(Pigment plain) * P(B recessive) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n4. Plain AND Checkered: Plain (c) occurs, and Checkered (b) also occurs. So P = P(Pigment plain) * P(Checkered) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 100%. That checks out.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations because the options provided do not include 56.25%, etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach is to look at the phenotypic ratios directly without relying solely on the probabilities. Each bird's phenotype can be represented by the combination of their pigment color and body color. Let's create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB (75% of F2)\n2. CcBb (25%)\n3. Ccbb (25%)\n4. CcBb (25%)\n5. ccBB (25%)\n6. ccBb (25%)\n7. ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, F2 consists of all combinations of the F1's gametes, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (from CB + CB)\n- CcBb (from CB + cb)\n- CcBb (from cb + CB)\n- CcBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n- ccBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this is getting confusing. A better method is to recognize that the F2 will have four phenotypic categories based on the combinations of the two genes. Each gene contributes independently, so the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the probabilities of each trait combination.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a Punnett square for the F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) cross. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies an F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps the F2 comes from the crossing of these two birds?\n\nWait, no. The question says \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the F1 is from the cross of CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, the F2 would come from the F1 crossed with itself, giving the four phenotypic categories.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the F2 will be the results of the F1 (CcBb) selfing. As previously thought, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n- ccBb (0%) [Wait, no\u2014this doesn't add up.]\n\nActually, upon reevaluating, the F2 should consist of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. Since the F1 can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n5. cb + cb \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, this seems off because there are six possible combinations, but the actual F2 should have four phenotypes, each combining the presence or absence of C and B. So, the four phenotypes remain as before: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb. Let me correct this.\n\nIn reality, the F2 will have the following four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n\nWait, but adding these percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which exceeds 100%, indicating an error in counting. Let's recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: CcBB \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: CcBb \u2192 50% (from two gamete combinations)\nPhenotype 3: ccBB \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nTotal: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which is impossible. This indicates a miscalculation in the distribution. Let's approach it differently.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) selfs, each F1 produces CB and cb gametes in equal proportions. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there may be other genotypes like CcBb from different combinations, but in this case, the F2 will only have four genotypes due to the F1's gamete composition. Now, converting these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. ccBB \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. ccBb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratio, we need to know how often each phenotype occurs in the F2 population. Assuming equal numbers of each gamete, the probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CcBB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: CcBb \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 3: ccBB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: ccBb \u2192 0% (Wait, no. Because F2 must account for all possible F1 gametes.)\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some combinations. Let me reconsider. When F1 (CcBB) selfs with itself, each F1 can produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations such as CcBb from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, but in the context of F2, we're focusing on the cross of F1 with F1. However, this approach might not capture all possible F2 genotypes. To get accurate counts, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square specifically for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nCreating a Punnett Square for F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb):\n\n- Parents:\n  - CcBB (Father)\n  - ccbb (Mother)\n\nGametes from Father (CcBB):\n  - CB\n  - CB\n  - CB\n  - CB\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm making a mistake here. The father's genotype is CcBB, meaning he can produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, CB, and CB. Similarly, the mother's genotype is ccbb, producing four gametes: cb, cb, cb, cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n\nWait, that suggests all F2 individuals are CcBb, which can't be right because other combinations are possible if the F1 were selfed differently.

CcBB \u00d7 CcBB \u2192 CcBB (but this is not possible because F1 cannot self to produce this genotype)\nWait, no\u2014the correct approach is to consider all possible gamete combinations. The F1 can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CcBB, CcBb, and ccBB.

Wait, no\u2014when F1 selfs, the F2 will only have the combinations of the F1's gametes. So perhaps I missed the fact that there are other combinations like CcBb from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, but in F2, we're only considering the F1 selfing results. So, perhaps I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nActually, upon closer examination, F2 from F1 selfing will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (5",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele: 75% (since it's homozygous dominant, but wait\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so for each gene, the probability of being at least one dominant allele is 75%, because C is dominant. Similarly, recessive is 25%. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is homozygous dominant for C (CC), then it definitely shows red pigment. If it's heterozygous (Cc), it might show red or some other color depending on B. Wait, but in our case, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will show red. For the B locus, same logic applies.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are based on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of the F2 birds fall into each category. Given that the F2 generation is produced by the cross of F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb), and each F1 can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions (50% each), the F2 will have four possible combinations of CB and cb gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (prob 25%)\n- Ccbb (prob 25%)\n- ccBB (prob 25%)\n- ccbb (prob 25%)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the F2 population isn't just these four genotypes but includes all combinations where each gene's alleles are combined. Actually, the correct way is to consider each gene separately. The F2 for each gene will be:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- Dominant (C) appears in 3/4 of the cases (since 25% are cc)\n- Recessive (c) appears in 1/4\n\nFor B (color):\n- Dominant (B) appears in 3/4 of the cases\n- Recessive (b) appears in 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. However, since each bird has two traits, the actual phenotypic ratios are more complex. Instead, it's better to use a Punnett square approach to list all possible combinations of the F1's gametes.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions. So the F2 will have four possible gamete combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccBb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 should include all possible combinations of the gametes. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (from CB + CB)\n- CcBb (from CB + cb)\n- CcBb (from cb + CB)\n- CcBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n- ccBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n\nWait, no, this seems too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the phenotypes are combinations, the overall ratio depends on the dominance of each trait. Let me instead calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach bird in F2 has two traits: pigment color and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, I'll count the number of F2 individuals that exhibit each combination.\n\nFirst, determine the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nGenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nCC | 25%\nCc | 50%\ncc | 25%\n\nBB | 25%\nBb | 50%\nbb | 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the joint frequencies are products of the individual frequencies. However, for phenotypic ratios, we don't need the exact counts but rather the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of dominant and recessive traits:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype for pigment color is determined by whether C is present, and similarly for B.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the proportion of each phenotype in F2, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- Probability of Pigment red = probability of at least one C (C/C, Cc, CC) = 75% (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%, so 25%+50%+25% = 100%). Wait, no\u2014actually, for the C locus, the presence of at least one C means Pigment red. The probability of Pigment red is 75% because it's recessive homozygous (cc) is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, Pigment plain (c) is 25%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Brown (B) is dominant; presence of at least one B means Brown.\n- Probability of Brown = 75% (similar reasoning).\n\nSo the four phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain AND Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to find the probability of each combination:\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- P(Pigment red) = 75% (probability of at least one C)\n- P(Brown) = 75% (probability of at least one B)\n- P(Pigment plain) = 25% (probability of cc)\n- P(Checkered) = 25% (probability of bb)\n\nNow, for each phenotype combination:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown: Both Pigment red and Brown occur. So P = P(Pigment red) * P(Brown) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered: Pigment red occurs, but Checkered (b) does not. So P = P(Pigment red) * P(B recessive) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n3. Plain AND Brown: Plain (c) occurs, but Brown (B) does not. So P = P(Pigment plain) * P(B recessive) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n4. Plain AND Checkered: Plain (c) occurs, and Checkered (b) also occurs. So P = P(Pigment plain) * P(Checkered) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 100%. That checks out.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations because the options provided do not include 56.25%, etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach is to look at the phenotypic ratios directly without relying solely on the probabilities. Each bird's phenotype can be represented by the combination of their pigment color and body color. Let's create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB (75% of F2)\n2. CcBb (25%)\n3. Ccbb (25%)\n4. CcBb (25%)\n5. ccBB (25%)\n6. ccBb (25%)\n7. ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, F2 consists of all combinations of the F1's gametes, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (from CB + CB)\n- CcBb (from CB + cb)\n- CcBb (from cb + CB)\n- CcBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- ccBb (from cb + CB)\n- ccBb (from cb + cb)\n- ccBB (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this is getting confusing. A better method is to recognize that the F2 will have four phenotypic categories based on the combinations of the two genes. Each gene contributes independently, so the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the probabilities of each trait combination.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a Punnett square for the F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) cross. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies an F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps the F2 comes from the crossing of these two birds?\n\nWait, no. The question says \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the F1 is from the cross of CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, the F2 would come from the F1 crossed with itself, giving the four phenotypic categories.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the F2 will be the results of the F1 (CcBb) selfing. As previously thought, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n- ccBb (0%) [Wait, no\u2014this doesn't add up.]\n\nActually, upon reevaluating, the F2 should consist of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. Since the F1 can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n5. cb + cb \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, this seems off because there are six possible combinations, but the actual F2 should have four phenotypes, each combining the presence or absence of C and B. So, the four phenotypes remain as before: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb. Let me correct this.\n\nIn reality, the F2 will have the following four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n\nWait, but adding these percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which exceeds 100%, indicating an error in counting. Let's recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: CcBB \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: CcBb \u2192 50% (from two gamete combinations)\nPhenotype 3: ccBB \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nTotal: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, which is impossible. This indicates a miscalculation in the distribution. Let's approach it differently.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) selfs, each F1 produces CB and cb gametes in equal proportions. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there may be other genotypes like CcBb from different combinations, but in this case, the F2 will only have four genotypes due to the F1's gamete composition. Now, converting these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. ccBB \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. ccBb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratio, we need to know how often each phenotype occurs in the F2 population. Assuming equal numbers of each gamete, the probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CcBB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: CcBb \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 3: ccBB \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: ccBb \u2192 0% (Wait, no. Because F2 must account for all possible F1 gametes.)\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some combinations. Let me reconsider. When F1 (CcBB) selfs with itself, each F1 can produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations such as CcBb from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, but in the context of F2, we're focusing on the cross of F1 with F1. However, this approach might not capture all possible F2 genotypes. To get accurate counts, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square specifically for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nCreating a Punnett Square for F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb):\n\n- Parents:\n  - CcBB (Father)\n  - ccbb (Mother)\n\nGametes from Father (CcBB):\n  - CB\n  - CB\n  - CB\n  - CB\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm making a mistake here. The father's genotype is CcBB, meaning he can produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, CB, and CB. Similarly, the mother's genotype is ccbb, producing four gametes: cb, cb, cb, cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n3. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n\nWait, that suggests all F2 individuals are CcBb, which can't be right because other combinations are possible if the F1 were selfed differently. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct F2 genotypes after selfing F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) are:\n\n1. CcBB \u00d7 CcBB \u2192 CcBB (but this is not possible because F1 cannot self to produce this genotype)\nWait, no\u2014the correct approach is to consider all possible gamete combinations. The F1 can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CcBB, CcBb, and ccBB. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. ccBB \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. ccBb \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25% (from CcBB)\n- Phenotype 2: 25% (from CB \u00d7 cb) + 25% (from cb \u00d7 CB) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 3: 25% (from ccBB)\n- Phenotype 4: 0% (Wait, no\u2014there's a mistake here because F2 should include all possible F1 gametes, including those that might lead to ccBb. Wait, no\u2014when F1 selfs, the F2 will only have the combinations of the F1's gametes. So perhaps I missed the fact that there are other combinations like CcBb from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, but in F2, we're only considering the F1 selfing results. So, perhaps I need to adjust my calculation.\n\nActually, upon closer examination, F2 from F1 selfing will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (5",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

For example:\n\n- Probability of having C present (C_) = 3/4 (since the parent is CC, so every F2 will have C)\nWait, no\u2014wait. The F1 is CcBb, so each gene segregates into C and c for the C locus, and B and b for the B locus. In F2, each gene will segregate into two-thirds dominant and one-third recessive, because the F1 is heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are both homozygous for each gene, then F1 will be heterozygous for each gene. When F1 selfs, the segregation follows Mendel's laws. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- From F1 (Cc), each gamete has a 50% chance of C or c.\nSo in F2, for C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- From F1 (Bb), each gamete has a 50% chance of B or b.\nSo in F2, for B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (so red):\n   - Since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n   - The only way to not be red is if both alleles are c (c c).\n   - Probability of c c = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n   - So probability of being red = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSecond, the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of at least one dominant B allele (brown):\n   - Only if the bird has at least one B allele.\n   - Probability of B B or B b = 3/4\n   - So probability of brown = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes act independently, the combined probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1.

Plain and checkered:\n   - Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding them up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes in the order mentioned above.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching our 9:3:3:1\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nC. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No\n\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No\n\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No\n\nK. None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the given options match my calculation of 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the original question expects a different approach or possibly misinterpretation of the parent genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not as described. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). Adihybrid cross between them. So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match except option J, which is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 9:3:3:1, but instead something else. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the presence of both traits rather than the sum of the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is wrong. Let me reconsider the parents.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes, so all offspring will get at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them all red and brown. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have all red and brown. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible that both genes are dominant leading to the same phenotype. Let me clarify: If both genes are dominant, the bird is red and brown. If only one gene is dominant, then it's either red or brown, depending on the gene. Similarly for the other trait.\n\nBut according to the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, regardless of the underlying genetic basis. So unless the problem specifies otherwise, the answer should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. The closest might be option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what I got. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which seems like a trihybrid scenario, but we're dealing with two genes here. Option D: 1:3:9:3, which is again similar but reversed. Option C: 12:2:2:0, also trihybrid-like.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem and the actual phenotypic ratio is not 9:3:3:1. Let me re-express the calculations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 3/4 chance for C, 3/4 for B \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 3/4*C, 1/4*b \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 1/4*c, 3/4*B \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 1/4*c, 1/4*b \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Reverse of our ratio.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Again, reverse.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Trihybrid.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Also trihybrid.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Trihybrid.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the closest might be none of the above. However, perhaps I've misread the problem and the actual phenotypic ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different type of dominance.\n\nWait, let me think again. Is the problem asking for the number of each phenotype, or the ratio?\n\nIn the problem statement, the user mentions \"expected phenotypic ratio,\" so it's likely the ratio of the number of each phenotype. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, option J is 2:6:3:1, which is close to our ratio but not exactly the same. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different approach, such as considering each trait separately without combining them, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Let me reevaluate the parent genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes, so all offspring will express both traits as dominant.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes, so all offspring will express neither trait as dominant.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, all F1 would be CcBb, which expresses both traits as dominant (red and brown). Therefore, all F1 would exhibit the same phenotype: red and brown. Thus, the F2 would also be all red and brown, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But this contradicts the previous calculations where I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier, I assumed that the F1 were CcBb and each could produce gametes CB and cb. But if Parent 2 is cc bb, it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2). When they mate, the F2 would consist of CcBb x CcBb, leading to the usual dihybrid cross with 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut now I'm getting conflicting results. On one hand, Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb and cb. When F1 (CcBb) mated with cb (from Parent 2), the F2 would be the cross of CcBb x cb. But wait, no, F1 is CcBb (from CC BB x cc bb), which produces gametes CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, giving 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut if Parent 2 is cc bb, it can only produce cb gametes, so F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). When F1 (CcBb) mates with cb, the F2 would consist of CcBb (from CcBb x cb) plus cb (from cb x cb). Wait, no\u2014when you cross CcBb (parent 1) with cb (parent 2), each F2 individual would receive one allele from each parent. So half of the F2 would be CcBb and half would be cb. Therefore, the F2 would be CcBb x cb x cb. Hmm, this complicates things further.\n\nWait, but let me correct myself. The F1 is CcBb, as both parents are CC BB and cc bb. They produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be a regular dihybrid cross. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, if Parent 2 is cc bb, which can only produce cb gametes, then F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). Then, F1 (CcBb) crossed with F1 (CcBb) would lead to F2 with 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, if F1 is CcBb and F2 is cb, then F2 would be CcBb (half) and cb (half). Therefore, the F2 would be a mix of CcBb and cb. But in reality, F1 is always CcBb, so when crossed with F1, it's still a dihybrid cross.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nCase 1: Both parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. F1 x F1 gives 9:3:3:1.\n\nCase 2: One parent is CC BB (produces CB and cb gametes), and the other is cc bb (produces cb gametes). F1 is CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). So F1 x F1 is CcBb x cb, producing F2 as follows: half of the F2 will be CcBb, and half will be cb. Therefore, the F2 consists of two groups: CcBb and cb.\n\nNow, in the F2, the C locus (pigment) has C (dominant) and c (recessive). The B locus has B (dominant) and b (recessive). The phenotypes depend on both loci.\n\nHalf of the F2 are CcBb, which is all red and brown. The other half are cb, which is plain and checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, with two phenotypes: red-brown and plain-checkered.\n\nBut the options don't include a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the parents are not both heterozygous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the F1 phenotypes, not the F2.\n\nBut the question asks for the F2. Given that, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the parents are both homozygous for one trait and the recessive for another. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back, the problem states: \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, giving 9:3:3:1.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options provided. Therefore, perhaps the original problem had different genotypes, or perhaps the options are misnumbered.\n\nGiven the options, none match 9:3:3:1. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 2:6:3:1, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option either.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc BB, but that changes everything. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb. That would make the F1 CcBb (from CC BB) and cBb (from cc Bb), leading to a different F2 ratio. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both), and Parent 2 is cc Bb (heterozygous for B but homozygous recessive for B?), wait no, cc is for B (recessive), and Bb is for B (dominant). So Parent 2 is cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 would be CC BB (from CC BB) and cc Bb (from cc Bb). Therefore, F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cBb (from cc Bb). So when F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be a dihybrid cross: 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut this still doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc BB, both homozygous dominant for B, then F1 would be CcBB (from CC BB) and cb (from cc BB), leading to F2 as CcBB x CcBB, resulting in a monohybrid ratio for B (dominant: 3/4, recessive: 1/4), and C (always dominant). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for the B trait, and 1:1 for the C trait. Combining both, it would be 3:1:3:1, which isn't any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, F1 would be CcBb and cBb. Then, F2 would be CcBb x cBb, leading to a dihybrid cross. The phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nAgain, not matching the options. This suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach or that the options are incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I might need to choose the closest available option, even if it doesn't perfectly match. Looking at the options, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, while our ratio is 16 parts. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't add up. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our calculation, indicating that maybe the dominant alleles are recessive in some cases, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each trait independently, leading to a trihybrid ratio, but that's not applicable here.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer might be option J: 2:6:3:1, but I'm not",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each bird's traits are determined independently, the phenotypic ratio can be found by calculating the probability of each combination. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n- Probability of having C (dominant) = 100% (since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be red)\nWait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it'll be red. If it has none (i.e., both alleles are recessive), it'll be plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the body color (B):\n- Probability of having B (dominant) = 100%\n- Probability of having b (recessive) = 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's only if both genes are considered together. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene will determine the phenotype. So, each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nBut wait, for the pigment color (C), the bird could be either C (dominant, red) or c (recessive, plain). Similarly, for the body color (B), the bird could be B (dominant, brown) or b (recessive, checkered).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the inheritance of the alleles for each gene. Since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (so red):\n   - Since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n   - The only way to not be red is if both alleles are c (c c).\n   - Probability of c c = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n   - So probability of being red = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSecond, the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of at least one dominant B allele (brown):\n   - Only if the bird has at least one B allele.\n   - Probability of B B or B b = 3/4\n   - So probability of brown = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes act independently, the combined probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown:\n   - Both traits are dominant.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered:\n   - Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b)\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown:\n   - Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered:\n   - Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b)\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding them up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes in the order mentioned above.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching our 9:3:3:1\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nC. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No\n\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No\n\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No\n\nK. None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the given options match my calculation of 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the original question expects a different approach or possibly misinterpretation of the parent genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not as described. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). Adihybrid cross between them. So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match except option J, which is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 9:3:3:1, but instead something else. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the presence of both traits rather than the sum of the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes is wrong. Let me reconsider the parents.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes, so all offspring will get at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them all red and brown. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have all red and brown. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's possible that both genes are dominant leading to the same phenotype. Let me clarify: If both genes are dominant, the bird is red and brown. If only one gene is dominant, then it's either red or brown, depending on the gene. Similarly for the other trait.\n\nBut according to the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, regardless of the underlying genetic basis. So unless the problem specifies otherwise, the answer should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. The closest might be option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what I got. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which seems like a trihybrid scenario, but we're dealing with two genes here. Option D: 1:3:9:3, which is again similar but reversed. Option C: 12:2:2:0, also trihybrid-like.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem and the actual phenotypic ratio is not 9:3:3:1. Let me re-express the calculations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 3/4 chance for C, 3/4 for B \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 3/4*C, 1/4*b \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 1/4*c, 3/4*B \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 1/4*c, 1/4*b \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Reverse of our ratio.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Again, reverse.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Trihybrid.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Also trihybrid.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Trihybrid.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the closest might be none of the above. However, perhaps I've misread the problem and the actual phenotypic ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a different type of dominance.\n\nWait, let me think again.

Let me reevaluate the parent genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes, so all offspring will express both traits as dominant.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes, so all offspring will express neither trait as dominant.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, all F1 would be CcBb, which expresses both traits as dominant (red and brown). Therefore, all F1 would exhibit the same phenotype: red and brown. Thus, the F2 would also be all red and brown, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But this contradicts the previous calculations where I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier, I assumed that the F1 were CcBb and each could produce gametes CB and cb. But if Parent 2 is cc bb, it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2). When they mate, the F2 would consist of CcBb x CcBb, leading to the usual dihybrid cross with 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut now I'm getting conflicting results. On one hand, Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb and cb. When F1 (CcBb) mated with cb (from Parent 2), the F2 would be the cross of CcBb x cb. But wait, no, F1 is CcBb (from CC BB x cc bb), which produces gametes CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, giving 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut if Parent 2 is cc bb, it can only produce cb gametes, so F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). When F1 (CcBb) mates with cb, the F2 would consist of CcBb (from CcBb x cb) plus cb (from cb x cb). Wait, no\u2014when you cross CcBb (parent 1) with cb (parent 2), each F2 individual would receive one allele from each parent. So half of the F2 would be CcBb and half would be cb. Therefore, the F2 would be CcBb x cb x cb. Hmm, this complicates things further.\n\nWait, but let me correct myself. The F1 is CcBb, as both parents are CC BB and cc bb. They produce gametes CB and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be a regular dihybrid cross. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, if Parent 2 is cc bb, which can only produce cb gametes, then F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). Then, F1 (CcBb) crossed with F1 (CcBb) would lead to F2 with 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, if F1 is CcBb and F2 is cb, then F2 would be CcBb (half) and cb (half). Therefore, the F2 would be a mix of CcBb and cb. But in reality, F1 is always CcBb, so when crossed with F1, it's still a dihybrid cross.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nCase 1: Both parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. F1 x F1 gives 9:3:3:1.\n\nCase 2: One parent is CC BB (produces CB and cb gametes), and the other is cc bb (produces cb gametes). F1 is CcBb (from CC BB) and cb (from cc bb). So F1 x F1 is CcBb x cb, producing F2 as follows: half of the F2 will be CcBb, and half will be cb. Therefore, the F2 consists of two groups: CcBb and cb.\n\nNow, in the F2, the C locus (pigment) has C (dominant) and c (recessive). The B locus has B (dominant) and b (recessive). The phenotypes depend on both loci.\n\nHalf of the F2 are CcBb, which is all red and brown. The other half are cb, which is plain and checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, with two phenotypes: red-brown and plain-checkered.\n\nBut the options don't include a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the parents are not both heterozygous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the F1 phenotypes, not the F2.\n\nBut the question asks for the F2. Given that, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the parents are both homozygous for one trait and the recessive for another. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back, the problem states: \"the checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, giving 9:3:3:1.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options provided. Therefore, perhaps the original problem had different genotypes, or perhaps the options are misnumbered.\n\nGiven the options, none match 9:3:3:1. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 2:6:3:1, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option either.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc BB, but that changes everything. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb. That would make the F1 CcBb (from CC BB) and cBb (from cc Bb), leading to a different F2 ratio. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both), and Parent 2 is cc Bb (heterozygous for B but homozygous recessive for B?), wait no, cc is for B (recessive), and Bb is for B (dominant). So Parent 2 is cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 would be CC BB (from CC BB) and cc Bb (from cc Bb). Therefore, F1 would be CcBb (from CC BB) and cBb (from cc Bb). So when F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the F2 would be a dihybrid cross: 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut this still doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc BB, both homozygous dominant for B, then F1 would be CcBB (from CC BB) and cb (from cc BB), leading to F2 as CcBB x CcBB, resulting in a monohybrid ratio for B (dominant: 3/4, recessive: 1/4), and C (always dominant). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for the B trait, and 1:1 for the C trait. Combining both, it would be 3:1:3:1, which isn't any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, F1 would be CcBb and cBb. Then, F2 would be CcBb x cBb, leading to a dihybrid cross. The phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nAgain, not matching the options. This suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach or that the options are incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I might need to choose the closest available option, even if it doesn't perfectly match. Looking at the options, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, while our ratio is 16 parts. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't add up. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is option E: 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our calculation, indicating that maybe the dominant alleles are recessive in some cases, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each trait independently, leading to a trihybrid ratio, but that's not applicable here.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer might be option J: 2:6:3:1, but I'm not",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Both recessive (c and b): 1/16\n\nWait, but in this problem, the options given don't include fractions like 9/16. Instead, the options use whole numbers. So perhaps the answer refers to the expected counts rather than exact ratios. So if we consider that, then the expected phenotypic ratios would correspond to the number of birds expected in each category, scaled up by the total number of offspring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the actual count for each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let's approach this differently. Let's determine the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFirst, list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus (gene for pigment):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Heterozygous (Cc) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (gene for body color):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Brown\n- Heterozygous (Bb) \u2192 Brown\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, considering both genes together, the possible combinations of alleles are:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n3. CC and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n4. Cc and BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n5. Cc and Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n6. Cc and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n7. cc and BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n8. cc and Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n9. cc and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird's genotype is a combination of both genes, so each bird is represented by a genotype pair (e.g., CcBB, CcBb, etc.). The phenotypes depend on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, let's categorize the possible phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown body \u2192 Occurs when either C is dominant or B is dominant.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered body \u2192 Occurs when C is dominant but B is recessive.\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown body \u2192 Occurs when c is dominant but B is dominant.\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered body \u2192 Occurs when both c and b are dominant.\n\nSo now, let's calculate how many of the 16 possible genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCCBB | Pheno1\nCCBb | Pheno1\nCCbb | Pheno1\nCcBB | Pheno1\nCcBb | Pheno1\nCcbb | Pheno2\nccBB | Pheno2\nccBb | Pheno2\nccbb | Pheno4\n\nFrom the table above:\n\n- Pheno1 occurs in 6 cases (all except Pheno2 and Pheno4).\n- Pheno2 occurs in 3 cases (cccBb).\n- Pheno3 occurs in 3 cases (ccBB).\n- Pheno4 occurs in 1 case (ccbb).\n\nWait, but looking back, some of the genotypes may lead to different phenotypes depending on the combination. For example, CcBb could also lead to Pigment red and Brown body. So, let's recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CCBb \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CCbb \u2192 Pheno1\n4. CcBB \u2192 Pheno1\n5. CcBb \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Ccbb \u2192 Pheno2\n7. ccBB \u2192 Pheno2\n8. ccBb \u2192 Pheno2\n9. ccbb \u2192 Pheno4\n\nYes, that adds up to 6 Pheno1, 3 Pheno2, 3 Pheno3, and 1 Pheno4.\n\nBut wait, in the previous approach, I considered the phenotypic ratios as 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Pheno1, Pheno2, Pheno3, Pheno4. So in terms of counts, if we assume a large number of offspring, say N, then:\n\n- Pheno1: 9/16 * N\n- Pheno2: 3/16 * N\n- Pheno3: 3/16 * N\n- Pheno4: 1/16 * N\n\nBut the answer choices are showing specific counts without fractions, such as \"checkered red 6\" instead of \"6/16\".\n\nWait, but the question says \"phenotypic ratio\", which usually refers to the proportion. However, sometimes people refer to the actual number of each phenotype relative to the total. But none of the answer choices seem to match this directly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the actual counts, not the proportions.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to J are various ratios, e.g., option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". If we consider the number of each phenotype, as per our calculation:\n\n- Pheno1 (Red, Brown): 6\n- Pheno2 (Plain, Brown): 3\n- Pheno3 (Plain, Checkered): 3\n- Pheno4 (Plain, Checkered): 1\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 13, which doesn't make sense because it's supposed to add up to the total number of offspring. Wait, but if we take the ratios as 9:3:3:1, then the actual counts would be multiples of these numbers. But the answer options don't provide fractions; they provide specific counts. So perhaps the options are giving the actual counts expected in the F2 generation, considering the number of possible phenotypes.\n\nIf we take the 9:3:3:1 ratio, and express it as actual counts:\n\n- Total parts: 16\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nExpressed as actual counts, assuming each part represents 1 bird, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which seems inverted compared to what I have. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- For Pigment: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- For Body: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThe combined phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n1. If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body (Pheno1)\n2. If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body (Pheno2)\n3. If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown body (Pheno3)\n4. If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered body (Pheno4)\n\nNow, counting the number of birds that fall into each category:\n\nTotal possible genotypes for C: 3 (CC, Cc, cc)\nTotal possible genotypes for B: 3 (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nThus, total possible phenotypes: 3 x 3 = 9, but since some genotypes share the same phenotype, the actual phenotypic classes are fewer.\n\nWait, but the possible phenotypes are four, as previously thought. Let's map them:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown body: This includes all genotypes where C is dominant or B is dominant. So:\n\n- CC (regardless of B)\n- Cc (regardless of B)\n- CC (regardless of B)\nWait, no, perhaps better to list each possible phenotype:\n\nPheno1: Pigment red (at least C dominant) AND Brown (at least B dominant) \u2192 All genotypes except those without C or without B. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, any bird that has at least one dominant allele for both genes will express both traits. So:\n\nPheno1: C dominant OR B dominant \u2192 All birds except those with cc and bb.\n\nWait, no, because if a bird has cc (no C) and B dominant (Bb or BB), it still has B dominant, so it'll have Brown body. Similarly, if it has C dominant but cc, it'll have Pigment red. So the only bird that doesn't have either dominant is when both are recessive, i.e., cc and bb.\n\nThus, the total number of birds expressing both traits (Pheno1) is 13 (since 16 total minus 3 non-expressing: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb).\n\nSimilarly, Pheno2: Pigment red (at least C) AND no brown (no B). So B must be recessive (bb). And C can be anything. So:\n\n- C dominant (CC, Cc) with bb \u2192 2\n\nPheno3: Pigment plain (no C) AND Brown (at least B). So C must be recessive (cc), and B can be anything. So:\n\n- ccBB, ccBb \u2192 2\n\nPheno4: Pigment plain (no C) AND no brown (no B). So C and B are recessive. Only one bird: ccbb.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\nPheno1: 13\nPheno2: 2\nPheno3: 2\nPheno4: 1\n\nAdding up to 18, which doesn't make sense because it should sum to 16. Clearly, I'm overcounting somewhere. Let's try again:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their alleles:\n\n- For Pigment: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- For Body: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThe possible combinations for each trait are independent, leading to four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): C_B_ \u2192 All except those without C or without B.\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): C_b_ \u2192 Those with C dominant but B recessive.\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): _cB_ \u2192 Those with C recessive but B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): _c_b_ \u2192 Those with both C and B recessive.\n\nNow, count each:\n\n1. C_B_: All except when c is present or b is present. So 16 - (number with c) - (number with b) + (number with both c and b). Hmm, inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nNumber of birds with C dominant (any B): 12 (since 3 C alleles \u00d7 4 B alleles = 12)\nNumber with B dominant (any C): 12 (similar logic)\nNumber with both C and B dominant: 9 (since 3 Cs \u00d7 3 Bs = 9)\nUsing inclusion-exclusion: 12 + 12 - 9 = 15 \u2192 So C_B_: 15?\n\nWait, this isn't making sense. Perhaps it's easier to list all possible genotypes and assign them to the appropriate phenotype.\n\nThere are 16 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_c_ \u2192 Pheno4\n\nWait, but according to this, Pheno1 has 6 genotypes (positions 1,2,4,5,7,8?), no:\n\nWait, position 1: CC BB \u2192 C_B_\nposition 2: CC Bb \u2192 C_B_\nposition 3: CC bb \u2192 C_b_\nposition 4: Cc BB \u2192 C_B_\nposition 5: Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_\nposition 6: Cc bb \u2192 C_b_\nposition 7: cc BB \u2192 c_b_\nposition 8: cc Bb \u2192 c_b_\nposition 9: cc bb \u2192 c_c_\n\nSo:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nThis sums to 4+2+2+1=9, but the total is 16, missing 7. Hmm, confusion arises. Maybe the error is in how I'm assigning genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to realize that the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype, considering independent assortment.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, and their F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, classifying each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pheno1\n2. Cc BB \u2192 Pheno1\n3. cc BB \u2192 Pheno3\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pheno1\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pheno3\n7. CC bb \u2192 Pheno2\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Pheno2\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pheno4\n\nCounting:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9, which doesn't match the 16 expected. I think the issue is that I'm misclassifying some genotypes. Wait, perhaps the classification needs to consider dominance properly.\n\nEach bird's genotype can be categorized as follows:\n\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThen, the phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, for each bird, if they have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, they express both traits (Pheno1). If they have at least one dominant C and no dominant B, they express pigment red (Pheno2). If they have no dominant C but at least one dominant B, they express brown (Pheno3). If they have neither dominant C nor B, they express checkered (Pheno4).\n\nNow, applying this to each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_c_ \u2192 Pheno4\n\nNow, counting:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9, which is less than 16. Again, something's wrong here. It must be due to incorrect categorization. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 C_b_\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 _cB_\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 _c_b_\n\nEach of these is distinct, and their counts can be found by considering the probability of each.\n\nSince each gene is assorting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n\n- Probability of C = 3/4\n- Probability of c = 1/4\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each bird is a dihybrid (two loci), the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 would be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: phenotypes with both dominant (C and B)\n- 3: phenotypes with pigment dominant and body recessive (C and b)\n- 3: phenotypes with pigment recessive and body dominant (c and B)\n- 1: phenotypes with both recessive (c and b)\n\nBut wait, in this case, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant C allele, it expresses red pigment regardless of the B allele. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B allele, it expresses brown color regardless of the C allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the number of birds that have:\n\n1. Both dominant C and B (C_B_): 9/16 of the population\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and body recessive (b): 3/16\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and body dominant (B): 3/16\n4. Both recessive (c and b): 1/16\n\nWait, but in this problem, the options given don't include fractions like 9/16. Instead, the options use whole numbers. So perhaps the answer refers to the expected counts rather than exact ratios. So if we consider that, then the expected phenotypic ratios would correspond to the number of birds expected in each category, scaled up by the total number of offspring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the actual count for each phenotype based on the possible genotypes. Let's approach this differently. Let's determine the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFirst, list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus (gene for pigment):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Heterozygous (Cc) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (gene for body color):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Brown\n- Heterozygous (Bb) \u2192 Brown\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, considering both genes together, the possible combinations of alleles are:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n3. CC and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n4. Cc and BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n5. Cc and Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n6. Cc and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n7. cc and BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n8. cc and Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body\n9. cc and bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird's genotype is a combination of both genes, so each bird is represented by a genotype pair (e.g., CcBB, CcBb, etc.). The phenotypes depend on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, let's categorize the possible phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown body \u2192 Occurs when either C is dominant or B is dominant.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered body \u2192 Occurs when C is dominant but B is recessive.\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown body \u2192 Occurs when c is dominant but B is dominant.\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered body \u2192 Occurs when both c and b are dominant.\n\nSo now, let's calculate how many of the 16 possible genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCCBB | Pheno1\nCCBb | Pheno1\nCCbb | Pheno1\nCcBB | Pheno1\nCcBb | Pheno1\nCcbb | Pheno2\nccBB | Pheno2\nccBb | Pheno2\nccbb | Pheno4\n\nFrom the table above:\n\n- Pheno1 occurs in 6 cases (all except Pheno2 and Pheno4).\n- Pheno2 occurs in 3 cases (cccBb).\n- Pheno3 occurs in 3 cases (ccBB).\n- Pheno4 occurs in 1 case (ccbb).\n\nWait, but looking back, some of the genotypes may lead to different phenotypes depending on the combination. For example, CcBb could also lead to Pigment red and Brown body. So, let's recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CCBb \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CCbb \u2192 Pheno1\n4. CcBB \u2192 Pheno1\n5. CcBb \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Ccbb \u2192 Pheno2\n7. ccBB \u2192 Pheno2\n8. ccBb \u2192 Pheno2\n9. ccbb \u2192 Pheno4\n\nYes, that adds up to 6 Pheno1, 3 Pheno2, 3 Pheno3, and 1 Pheno4.\n\nBut wait, in the previous approach, I considered the phenotypic ratios as 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Pheno1, Pheno2, Pheno3, Pheno4. So in terms of counts, if we assume a large number of offspring, say N, then:\n\n- Pheno1: 9/16 * N\n- Pheno2: 3/16 * N\n- Pheno3: 3/16 * N\n- Pheno4: 1/16 * N\n\nBut the answer choices are showing specific counts without fractions, such as \"checkered red 6\" instead of \"6/16\".\n\nWait, but the question says \"phenotypic ratio\", which usually refers to the proportion. However, sometimes people refer to the actual number of each phenotype relative to the total. But none of the answer choices seem to match this directly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the actual counts, not the proportions.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to J are various ratios, e.g., option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". If we consider the number of each phenotype, as per our calculation:\n\n- Pheno1 (Red, Brown): 6\n- Pheno2 (Plain, Brown): 3\n- Pheno3 (Plain, Checkered): 3\n- Pheno4 (Plain, Checkered): 1\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 13, which doesn't make sense because it's supposed to add up to the total number of offspring. Wait, but if we take the ratios as 9:3:3:1, then the actual counts would be multiples of these numbers. But the answer options don't provide fractions; they provide specific counts. So perhaps the options are giving the actual counts expected in the F2 generation, considering the number of possible phenotypes.\n\nIf we take the 9:3:3:1 ratio, and express it as actual counts:\n\n- Total parts: 16\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nExpressed as actual counts, assuming each part represents 1 bird, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which seems inverted compared to what I have. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- For Pigment: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- For Body: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThe combined phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n1. If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body (Pheno1)\n2. If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body (Pheno2)\n3. If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown body (Pheno3)\n4. If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered body (Pheno4)\n\nNow, counting the number of birds that fall into each category:\n\nTotal possible genotypes for C: 3 (CC, Cc, cc)\nTotal possible genotypes for B: 3 (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nThus, total possible phenotypes: 3 x 3 = 9, but since some genotypes share the same phenotype, the actual phenotypic classes are fewer.\n\nWait, but the possible phenotypes are four, as previously thought. Let's map them:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown body: This includes all genotypes where C is dominant or B is dominant. So:\n\n- CC (regardless of B)\n- Cc (regardless of B)\n- CC (regardless of B)\nWait, no, perhaps better to list each possible phenotype:\n\nPheno1: Pigment red (at least C dominant) AND Brown (at least B dominant) \u2192 All genotypes except those without C or without B. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, any bird that has at least one dominant allele for both genes will express both traits. So:\n\nPheno1: C dominant OR B dominant \u2192 All birds except those with cc and bb.\n\nWait, no, because if a bird has cc (no C) and B dominant (Bb or BB), it still has B dominant, so it'll have Brown body. Similarly, if it has C dominant but cc, it'll have Pigment red. So the only bird that doesn't have either dominant is when both are recessive, i.e., cc and bb.\n\nThus, the total number of birds expressing both traits (Pheno1) is 13 (since 16 total minus 3 non-expressing: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb).\n\nSimilarly, Pheno2: Pigment red (at least C) AND no brown (no B). So B must be recessive (bb). And C can be anything. So:\n\n- C dominant (CC, Cc) with bb \u2192 2\n\nPheno3: Pigment plain (no C) AND Brown (at least B). So C must be recessive (cc), and B can be anything. So:\n\n- ccBB, ccBb \u2192 2\n\nPheno4: Pigment plain (no C) AND no brown (no B). So C and B are recessive. Only one bird: ccbb.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\nPheno1: 13\nPheno2: 2\nPheno3: 2\nPheno4: 1\n\nAdding up to 18, which doesn't make sense because it should sum to 16. Clearly, I'm overcounting somewhere. Let's try again:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their alleles:\n\n- For Pigment: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- For Body: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThe possible combinations for each trait are independent, leading to four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): C_B_ \u2192 All except those without C or without B.\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): C_b_ \u2192 Those with C dominant but B recessive.\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): _cB_ \u2192 Those with C recessive but B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): _c_b_ \u2192 Those with both C and B recessive.\n\nNow, count each:\n\n1. C_B_: All except when c is present or b is present. So 16 - (number with c) - (number with b) + (number with both c and b). Hmm, inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nNumber of birds with C dominant (any B): 12 (since 3 C alleles \u00d7 4 B alleles = 12)\nNumber with B dominant (any C): 12 (similar logic)\nNumber with both C and B dominant: 9 (since 3 Cs \u00d7 3 Bs = 9)\nUsing inclusion-exclusion: 12 + 12 - 9 = 15 \u2192 So C_B_: 15?\n\nWait, this isn't making sense. Perhaps it's easier to list all possible genotypes and assign them to the appropriate phenotype.\n\nThere are 16 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_c_ \u2192 Pheno4\n\nWait, but according to this, Pheno1 has 6 genotypes (positions 1,2,4,5,7,8?), no:\n\nWait, position 1: CC BB \u2192 C_B_\nposition 2: CC Bb \u2192 C_B_\nposition 3: CC bb \u2192 C_b_\nposition 4: Cc BB \u2192 C_B_\nposition 5: Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_\nposition 6: Cc bb \u2192 C_b_\nposition 7: cc BB \u2192 c_b_\nposition 8: cc Bb \u2192 c_b_\nposition 9: cc bb \u2192 c_c_\n\nSo:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nThis sums to 4+2+2+1=9, but the total is 16, missing 7. Hmm, confusion arises. Maybe the error is in how I'm assigning genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to realize that the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype, considering independent assortment.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, and their F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, classifying each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pheno1\n2. Cc BB \u2192 Pheno1\n3. cc BB \u2192 Pheno3\n4. CC Bb \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pheno1\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pheno3\n7. CC bb \u2192 Pheno2\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Pheno2\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pheno4\n\nCounting:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9, which doesn't match the 16 expected. I think the issue is that I'm misclassifying some genotypes. Wait, perhaps the classification needs to consider dominance properly.\n\nEach bird's genotype can be categorized as follows:\n\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThen, the phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, for each bird, if they have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, they express both traits (Pheno1). If they have at least one dominant C and no dominant B, they express pigment red (Pheno2). If they have no dominant C but at least one dominant B, they express brown (Pheno3). If they have neither dominant C nor B, they express checkered (Pheno4).\n\nNow, applying this to each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Pheno1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Pheno2\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c_b_ \u2192 Pheno3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c_c_ \u2192 Pheno4\n\nNow, counting:\n\nPheno1: positions 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nPheno2: positions 3,6 \u2192 2\nPheno3: positions 7,8 \u2192 2\nPheno4: position 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9, which is less than 16. Again, something's wrong here. It must be due to incorrect categorization. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 C_b_\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 _cB_\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 _c_b_\n\nEach of these is distinct, and their counts can be found by considering the probability of each.\n\nSince each gene is assorting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n\n- Probability of C = 3/4\n- Probability of c = 1/4\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (C_: 3/4)\n- Probability of being plain (cc): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (B_: 3/4)\n- Probability of being brown (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): probability = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (Bb): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (cc) and brown (B_): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (cc) and checkered (Bb): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014is the order correct? Let me double-check. Pigment red corresponds to having at least one dominant C, and body brown corresponds to at least one dominant B. So the combinations are:\n\n- Both traits expressed: (C_ and B_), which happens when both genes are active.\n- Pigment red, checkered: (C_ and Bb)\n- Plain, brown: (cc and B_)\n- Plain, checkered: (cc and Bb)\n\nBut I think the last two might not make sense because the bird could either be checkered or plain depending on the B locus, regardless of the C locus. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, where each represents the counts for each phenotype type. Wait, but the options given don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me look back at the options. Hmm, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me see:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving different ratios. Looking at option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 which seems like a 6:1 ratio for each phenotype, but that doesn't fit our calculation. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 also doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same issue. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't our case. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12 total, which fits our sum (since 9+3+3+1=16, but the options don't match exactly). Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, similar. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none directly say that. However, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our 9:3:3:1, but arranged differently. Let me confirm: checkered red is when both traits are expressed (C_ and B_), which is 9 parts. Checkered brown is when C_ and Bb, which is 3 parts. Plain red is when cc and B_, which is 3 parts. Plain brown is when cc and Bb, which is 1 part. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But wait, the way the options are presented, option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's exactly matching.

Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (C_: 3/4)\n- Probability of being plain (cc): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (B_: 3/4)\n- Probability of being brown (bb): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): probability = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (Bb): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (cc) and brown (B_): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (cc) and checkered (Bb): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014is the order correct? Let me double-check. Pigment red corresponds to having at least one dominant C, and body brown corresponds to at least one dominant B. So the combinations are:\n\n- Both traits expressed: (C_ and B_), which happens when both genes are active.\n- Pigment red, checkered: (C_ and Bb)\n- Plain, brown: (cc and B_)\n- Plain, checkered: (cc and Bb)\n\nBut I think the last two might not make sense because the bird could either be checkered or plain depending on the B locus, regardless of the C locus. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, where each represents the counts for each phenotype type. Wait, but the options given don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me look back at the options. Hmm, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me see:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving different ratios. Looking at option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 which seems like a 6:1 ratio for each phenotype, but that doesn't fit our calculation. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 also doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same issue. Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't our case. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12 total, which fits our sum (since 9+3+3+1=16, but the options don't match exactly). Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, similar. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none directly say that. However, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our 9:3:3:1, but arranged differently. Let me confirm: checkered red is when both traits are expressed (C_ and B_), which is 9 parts. Checkered brown is when C_ and Bb, which is 3 parts. Plain red is when cc and B_, which is 3 parts. Plain brown is when cc and Bb, which is 1 part. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But wait, the way the options are presented, option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's exactly matching. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that both parents are homozygous for each gene (parent 1 is CC BB, parent 2 is cc bb), all F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be all the combinations resulting from crossing CcBb with itself.",
    "rollout": " Given that both parents are homozygous for each gene (parent 1 is CC BB, parent 2 is cc bb), all F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be all the combinations resulting from crossing CcBb with itself.\n\nSo now, the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the combination of C and B traits. For pigment color: C (red) vs c (plain). For body color: B (brown) vs b (checkered). Since these genes are linked and presumably assort independently, the phenotypic ratio would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. Each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive in F2, except when linked. Assuming independent assortment, the phenotypic ratio would be (number of C/C, C/c, c/c) times (number of B/B, B/b, b/b). But since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio combines these. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown): All individuals with at least one dominant allele for both genes.\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has any dominant alleles for each gene. For pigment color (C): \n- If the bird has at least one C, it's red.\n- If it has none (i.e., c), it's plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If it has none (i.e., b), it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B): This requires at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b): Requires C (any) and b (at least one).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Requires c (any) and B (any).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Requires c and b.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFirst, determine the probability for each trait:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of having at least one C (red): 1 - (probability of c) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Probability of having none (plain): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Similarly, 3/4 chance of brown, 1/4 chance of checkered.\n\nSince the two genes are assumed to assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait combination.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B)\nProbability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b)\nProbability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B)\nProbability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b)\nProbability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into counts, assuming a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, they seem to express ratios without absolute numbers. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A to H list phenotypic ratios as specific counts, like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" etc. So we need to see which option matches our calculation.\n\nOur calculations give:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, Option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match. Option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes! That's exactly what we got. So the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to avoid mistakes. The probabilities were 9/16 for checkered red, 3/16 for checkered brown, 3/16 for plain red, and 1/16 for plain brown. So the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. Rearranged, it's 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Since each gene acts independently, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nWait, but in reality, both genes are determining the same bird's phenotype, so the combination of both genes' effects matters. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC (C)\n- Cc (Cc)\n- cc (cc)\n\nBut wait, in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so all F1 will be CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb as well, right? Because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 will inherit C from both parents with a 50% chance for each parent, leading to CC, Cc, or cc. Similarly, for B locus (body color):\n\nParents are BB and bb, so F1 will be Bb, and F2 will be Bb. So the B locus will always be Bb in F2. So the possible genotypes for each bird in F2 are:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For B: Bb (always, since F1 is Bb and parents are BB and bb, so F2 remains Bb)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So for pigment color (C), if an animal has at least one dominant C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. For body color (B), if an animal has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown; else, it's checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, brown (RRB) \u2192 but since the bird has two dominant alleles (C and B), it's red and brown.\n2. Pigment red, checkered (RBB) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain, brown (rrB) \u2192 c and B dominant.\n4. Plain, checkered (r r b) \u2192 c and B recessive.\n\nWait, but let me represent them properly:\n\nPhenotype combinations:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Pigmented red and brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented red and checkered\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities for each of these four phenotypes.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant) AND Brown (B dominant): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (probability of C) * (probability of B)\n   - P(C) = 3/4 (since C can be CC, Cc, or cc)\n   - P(B) = 3/4 (since B can be BB, Bb, or bb)\n   - So, P(Red and Brown) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigmented red (C dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive): \n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(not B) = 1/4 (since B is recessive)\n   - So, P(Red and Checkered) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (C recessive) AND Brown (B dominant):\n   - P(not C) = 1/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - So, P(Plain and Brown) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (C recessive) AND Checkered (B recessive):\n   - P(not C) = 1/4\n   - P(not B) = 1/4\n   - So, P(Plain and Checkered) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9/16\n- Red and Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nNow, to express this as a ratio, we can sum the numerators where applicable. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This corresponds to option D, which states: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Wait, that doesn't match my calculation.

Option D says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums up to 2+6+3+1=12, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probabilities.\n\nWait, no, another approach is to consider the number of each genotype in F2 and then translate that into phenotypes. Let's see:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd since B is always Bb, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the answer in terms of numbers, like 9:3:3:1.

Hmm, perhaps I miscounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the F2 calculation. Each parent is CcBb, so in F1, each bird is CcBb. In F2, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). The phenotypes for each:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red, plain body (since C is dominant, but B is recessive, so plain body).\n- Cc: Pigmented red, checkered body (since C is dominant, B is recessive).\n- cc: Plain, checkered body (since C is recessive, B is recessive).\n\nSo now, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nEach parent contributes 3 possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the parents. Wait, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from F1 selfing. So each F2 bird will receive one allele from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, all gametes are CB. Parent 2 is cc bb, so all gametes are cb. Thus, F2 will be Cc (from CB) and cb (from cb), so F2 genotype is CcBb. Wait, but wait, each parent can only contribute one allele, so the F2 bird will get either CB or cb from each parent. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB\n- From Parent 2: cb\n\nSo F2 genotypes are CB and cb. Therefore, the possible gametes from F1 (which is CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So F2 would have a 25% chance of having CB, 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite accurate. Since F1 is CcBb, it can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So F2 will have four combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC (from C) and BB (from B) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigmented red, Brown\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc (from C) and Bb (from B) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigmented red, Checkered\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc (from C) and Bb (from B) \u2192 Same as above\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc (from C) and bb (from B) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% Pigmented red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- 50% Pigmented red, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- 25% Plain, Checkered (phenotype 3)\n\nNow, translating these into ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: 25% \u2192 1 part\nPhenotype 2: 50% \u2192 2 parts\nPhenotype 3: 25% \u2192 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:1, corresponding to Pigmented red and Brown : Pigmented red and Checkered : Plain and Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Since each gene acts independently, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nWait, but in reality, both genes are determining the same bird's phenotype, so the combination of both genes' effects matters. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC (C)\n- Cc (Cc)\n- cc (cc)\n\nBut wait, in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so all F1 will be CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb as well, right? Because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 will inherit C from both parents with a 50% chance for each parent, leading to CC, Cc, or cc. Similarly, for B locus (body color):\n\nParents are BB and bb, so F1 will be Bb, and F2 will be Bb. So the B locus will always be Bb in F2. So the possible genotypes for each bird in F2 are:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For B: Bb (always, since F1 is Bb and parents are BB and bb, so F2 remains Bb)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So for pigment color (C), if an animal has at least one dominant C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. For body color (B), if an animal has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown; else, it's checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red, brown (RRB) \u2192 but since the bird has two dominant alleles (C and B), it's red and brown.\n2. Pigment red, checkered (RBB) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain, brown (rrB) \u2192 c and B dominant.\n4. Plain, checkered (r r b) \u2192 c and B recessive.\n\nWait, but let me represent them properly:\n\nPhenotype combinations:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Pigmented red and brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented red and checkered\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities for each of these four phenotypes.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant) AND Brown (B dominant): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (probability of C) * (probability of B)\n   - P(C) = 3/4 (since C can be CC, Cc, or cc)\n   - P(B) = 3/4 (since B can be BB, Bb, or bb)\n   - So, P(Red and Brown) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigmented red (C dominant) AND Checkered (B recessive): \n   - P(C) = 3/4\n   - P(not B) = 1/4 (since B is recessive)\n   - So, P(Red and Checkered) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (C recessive) AND Brown (B dominant):\n   - P(not C) = 1/4\n   - P(B) = 3/4\n   - So, P(Plain and Brown) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (C recessive) AND Checkered (B recessive):\n   - P(not C) = 1/4\n   - P(not B) = 1/4\n   - So, P(Plain and Checkered) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9/16\n- Red and Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nNow, to express this as a ratio, we can sum the numerators where applicable. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This corresponds to option D, which states: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" Wait, that doesn't match my calculation.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios:",
    "rollout": " Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25%, 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%, 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%, and 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%. Adding up these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56:18:18:6. Simplifying, dividing by 6.25 gives us 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't match our calculation. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Not matching. Option A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, close to our 56:18:18:6 but scaled differently. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No, that seems off. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Again, scaled down. Option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Still not matching. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" This is the 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't what we have. Option B: \"Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\" No, not matching. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option G was earlier thought, but it didn't fit. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check. The possible phenotypes are 4, with counts 56, 18, 18, 6. To express this as a ratio, divide each by the smallest number, which is 6. 56/6 \u2248 9.33, 18/6=3, same for others. So the simplified ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1. So the actual numbers should be multiples of these. If the total is 100%, then 9 parts correspond to checkered red, 3 to checkered brown, 3 to plain red, and 1 to plain brown. So the count would be 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1 except maybe not being listed. But looking back, the options don't include any exact 9:3:3:1. Wait, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, which is less than 100. Maybe it's scaled down. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only two traits without considering dominance fully. Wait, the question states that checkered is controlled by c, and plain by recessive. So perhaps the actual phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: red (since C is dominant)\n- Pigmented red and checkered: red\n- Plain and brown: plain\n- Plain and checkered: checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype depends on the probability of having the dominant or recessive alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 75%\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 25%\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown: (C for pigment) * (B for body) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. Pigmented red and checkered: (C) * (b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown: (c) * (B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered: (c) * (b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%. Now, scaling these to whole numbers by multiplying by 16 (the least common multiple of denominators 4 and 2), we get:\n\n1. Checkered red and brown: 56.25 * 16 = 900\n2. Checkered red and checkered: 18.75 * 16 = 300\n3. Plain and brown: 18.75 * 16 = 300\n4. Plain and checkered: 6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not absolute numbers. So the ratio is 900 : 300 : 300 : 100, which simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. \n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. However, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, which is different. Option I is \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" summing to 16 as well. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" summing to 16. None seem to match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me re-examine them:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nNone of these options represent 9:3:3:1. However, option C does represent 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the question expects the ratio in terms of actual counts rather than percentages. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking at option G, it says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" If we consider that, the actual counts could be 12, 2, 2, 0, which sum to 16. Similarly, option I is 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16.\n\nIf the question requires the ratio in terms of actual numbers, perhaps the answer is option C: 9:3:3:1, but since it's not among the choices, perhaps the closest is option G, which represents 9:3:3:1 but scaled down. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the raw counts, not the percentage-based ratio. In that case, the 56:18:18:6 would translate into 56, 18, 18, 6. But none of the options match this. However, option B is 8,4,0,4, which also sums to 16. If the question expects the ratio in the simplest integer form, 8:4:0:4 reduces to 2:1:0:1, which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nSum: 12+2+2+0=16\n\nOption I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nSum:7+5+1+3=16\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nSum:1+3+9+3=16\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nOption B:8,4,0,4\u2192sum16\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192sum16\n\nThus, none of the options perfectly represent 9:3:3:1, but option C is the closest. However, the question might expect the raw counts, not the percentage-based ratio. In that case, the correct ratio would be 56:18:18:6, but none of the options match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is a subset of the actual ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes, regardless of dominance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\"\n\nBut I'm still confused because my calculations suggest a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't present. Maybe the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without dominance considerations, but that wouldn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nEach bird can have four possible combinations of the two genes: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the homozygotes necessarily. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. So F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc bb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the genes are on separate chromosomes, so the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for each gene, the gametes are equally likely for each allele, leading to four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen two organisms are crossed where each has two heterozygous genes (like Aa Bb), the resulting gametes are AB, Ab, aB, ab, each at 25%. So applying this to our case, the F1 bird (CcBB) would produce gametes CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccBb? Wait, no\u2014actually, the correct way is to consider that each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only contribute CB.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only contribute cb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2. Thus, the F1 bird is CcBb, and all its gametes will be CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) would produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, classifying these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (for pigment) \u2192 red\n  - Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n  - Cc \u2192 red (because C is dominant)\n- bb \u2192 brown\n  - cb \u2192 brown\n- cc \u2192 plain\n  - cb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the genes determine the phenotype. Pigment color is controlled by C (dominant) and B (dominant). So:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 red-brown\n- C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 red-checkered\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 plain-brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, calculating the proportions:\n\nFrom the F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25% \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdding these up:\n\n- Red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Red-checkered: 25%\n- Plain-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain-checkered: 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% red-brown : 25% red-checkered : 50% plain-brown : 25% plain-checkered.\n\nSimplifying, the ratio is 2:1:2:1.\n\nHowever, in terms of actual counts (assuming 100 individuals), it would be 50:25:50:25, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. But looking back at the options, none of them matches this. The closest is option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums to 16. If we scale the actual ratio to 16, we'd have:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% of 16 is 8\n- Checkered brown: 25% of 16 is 4\n- Plain red: 25% of 16 is 4\n- Plain brown: 25% of 16 is 4\n\nWhich would be 8:4:4:4, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, if we take the ratios as 50:25:50:25 and scale them to 16, it becomes 8:4:8:4, which still doesn't match any option. Perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as counting specific combinations instead of percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance. For example:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: 56% \u2192 56\n- Pigmented red and checkered: 18% \u2192 18\n- Plain and brown: 18% \u2192 18\n- Plain and checkered: 6% \u2192 6\n\nTotal: 56+18+18+6=100\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 16. However, this doesn't align with the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio unless scaled down.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the ratio without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to list the phenotypic ratios without dominance, resulting in 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match, I'm inclined to choose option G, which is the closest, even though it's not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes. Let me double-check. The genes are C (pigmentation), B (color), and the birds are:\n\n- Checkered (c) for both C and B? No, wait, the description says:\n\n- Checkered",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios are 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25%, 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%, 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%, and 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%. Adding up these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56:18:18:6. Simplifying, dividing by 6.25 gives us 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't match our calculation. Option H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Also not matching. Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Not matching. Option A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, close to our 56:18:18:6 but scaled differently. Option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" No, that seems off. Option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Again, scaled down. Option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Still not matching. Option F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" This is the 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't what we have. Option B: \"Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\" No, not matching. Option I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" No. Option G was earlier thought, but it didn't fit. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check. The possible phenotypes are 4, with counts 56, 18, 18, 6. To express this as a ratio, divide each by the smallest number, which is 6. 56/6 \u2248 9.33, 18/6=3, same for others. So the simplified ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1. So the actual numbers should be multiples of these. If the total is 100%, then 9 parts correspond to checkered red, 3 to checkered brown, 3 to plain red, and 1 to plain brown. So the count would be 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1 except maybe not being listed. But looking back, the options don't include any exact 9:3:3:1. Wait, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, which is less than 100. Maybe it's scaled down. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only two traits without considering dominance fully. Wait, the question states that checkered is controlled by c, and plain by recessive. So perhaps the actual phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: red (since C is dominant)\n- Pigmented red and checkered: red\n- Plain and brown: plain\n- Plain and checkered: checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype depends on the probability of having the dominant or recessive alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 75%\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 25%\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown: (C for pigment) * (B for body) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. Pigmented red and checkered: (C) * (b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. Plain and brown: (c) * (B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Plain and checkered: (c) * (b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%. Now, scaling these to whole numbers by multiplying by 16 (the least common multiple of denominators 4 and 2), we get:\n\n1. Checkered red and brown: 56.25 * 16 = 900\n2. Checkered red and checkered: 18.75 * 16 = 300\n3. Plain and brown: 18.75 * 16 = 300\n4. Plain and checkered: 6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not absolute numbers. So the ratio is 900 : 300 : 300 : 100, which simplifies to 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. \n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. However, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, which is different. Option I is \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" summing to 16 as well. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" summing to 16. None seem to match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me re-examine them:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nNone of these options represent 9:3:3:1. However, option C does represent 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the question expects the ratio in terms of actual counts rather than percentages. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking at option G, it says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" If we consider that, the actual counts could be 12, 2, 2, 0, which sum to 16. Similarly, option I is 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16.\n\nIf the question requires the ratio in terms of actual numbers, perhaps the answer is option C: 9:3:3:1, but since it's not among the choices, perhaps the closest is option G, which represents 9:3:3:1 but scaled down. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the raw counts, not the percentage-based ratio. In that case, the 56:18:18:6 would translate into 56, 18, 18, 6. But none of the options match this. However, option B is 8,4,0,4, which also sums to 16. If the question expects the ratio in the simplest integer form, 8:4:0:4 reduces to 2:1:0:1, which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nSum: 12+2+2+0=16\n\nOption I: \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nSum:7+5+1+3=16\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nSum:1+3+9+3=16\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nOption B:8,4,0,4\u2192sum16\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192sum16\n\nThus, none of the options perfectly represent 9:3:3:1, but option C is the closest. However, the question might expect the raw counts, not the percentage-based ratio. In that case, the correct ratio would be 56:18:18:6, but none of the options match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is a subset of the actual ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio in terms of phenotypic classes, regardless of dominance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\"\n\nBut I'm still confused because my calculations suggest a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't present. Maybe the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio without dominance considerations, but that wouldn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nEach bird can have four possible combinations of the two genes: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the homozygotes necessarily. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. So F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield 25% CC BB, 25% CC bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc bb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the genes are on separate chromosomes, so the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for each gene, the gametes are equally likely for each allele, leading to four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen two organisms are crossed where each has two heterozygous genes (like Aa Bb), the resulting gametes are AB, Ab, aB, ab, each at 25%. So applying this to our case, the F1 bird (CcBB) would produce gametes CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccBb? Wait, no\u2014actually, the correct way is to consider that each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only contribute CB.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only contribute cb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2. Thus, the F1 bird is CcBb, and all its gametes will be CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) would produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, classifying these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (for pigment) \u2192 red\n  - Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n  - Cc \u2192 red (because C is dominant)\n- bb \u2192 brown\n  - cb \u2192 brown\n- cc \u2192 plain\n  - cb \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the genes determine the phenotype. Pigment color is controlled by C (dominant) and B (dominant). So:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 red-brown\n- C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 red-checkered\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 plain-brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, calculating the proportions:\n\nFrom the F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25% \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdding these up:\n\n- Red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Red-checkered: 25%\n- Plain-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain-checkered: 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% red-brown : 25% red-checkered : 50% plain-brown : 25% plain-checkered.\n\nSimplifying, the ratio is 2:1:2:1.\n\nHowever, in terms of actual counts (assuming 100 individuals), it would be 50:25:50:25, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. But looking back at the options, none of them matches this. The closest is option G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums to 16. If we scale the actual ratio to 16, we'd have:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% of 16 is 8\n- Checkered brown: 25% of 16 is 4\n- Plain red: 25% of 16 is 4\n- Plain brown: 25% of 16 is 4\n\nWhich would be 8:4:4:4, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, if we take the ratios as 50:25:50:25 and scale them to 16, it becomes 8:4:8:4, which still doesn't match any option. Perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as counting specific combinations instead of percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance. For example:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: 56% \u2192 56\n- Pigmented red and checkered: 18% \u2192 18\n- Plain and brown: 18% \u2192 18\n- Plain and checkered: 6% \u2192 6\n\nTotal: 56+18+18+6=100\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option C: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 16. However, this doesn't align with the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio unless scaled down.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the ratio without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to list the phenotypic ratios without dominance, resulting in 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match, I'm inclined to choose option G, which is the closest, even though it's not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes. Let me double-check. The genes are C (pigmentation), B (color), and the birds are:\n\n- Checkered (c) for both C and B? No, wait, the description says:\n\n- Checkered",

    "chunk_removed": "Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios.",
    "rollout": " Given that both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes, so the F1 will be heterozygous for both genes, and the F2 will be a trihybrid. But since we're dealing with two genes, each with two alleles, the possible phenotypic combinations will be 3 x 3 = 9, but adjusted for dominance. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the genes are linked or not. If they are independent, then each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic classes, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance. However, in this case, since each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined by one gene, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 divided by 4, but I might be overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So for pigment color, a dominant C results in red, and recessive c results in plain. Similarly, for body color, a dominant B results in brown, and recessive b results in checkered. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 \"Checkered Red\"\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 \"Plain Red\"\n3. c dominant, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 \"Plain Brown\"\n4. c dominant, B recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\nNow, to determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation. Since each parent is homozygous for both genes (one parent is CC BB, the other is cc bb), the F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability. So, for each possible combination of C and B, we calculate the probability as follows:\n\nFor C:\n\n- C dominant (C): 3/4 (since C appears in 3 cases: CC, Cc, Cc, and cC, but wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. For C, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, or cc. The phenotype is determined by whether C is present or not. So:\n\n- C present (red): 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of the cases)\n- C absent (plain): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4\n- B absent (checkered): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the overall phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n1. Checkered Red (cB present):\n   - C is recessive: 1/4\n   - B is recessive: 1/4\n   - Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: 1\n\n2. Checkered Brown (cB present, B recessive):\n   - C recessive: 1/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: 2\n\n3. Plain Red (Cc present, B recessive):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B recessive: 1/4\n   - Probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: 3\n\n4. Plain Brown (Cc present, B present):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: 4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9, corresponding to Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown respectively.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly this 1:3:3:9 ratio. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypic ratios. Another approach is to consider the number of offspring in the F2 generation. Since each parent is CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following distribution for each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: same as above\n\nThe phenotypes depend on whether C and B are present or not. As earlier, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 1:3:3:9. But none of the options provided reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H, each providing a different phenotypic ratio. None of them match 1:3:3:9. For instance, option D says 1, checkered red; 3, checkered brown; 9, plain red; 3, plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which seems impossible because 1+3+3+9=16, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the F2 refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. Because the user initially said, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" But the initial cross was between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfing would be F2. But perhaps the question meant F1 generation? Let me re-examine the initial setup.\n\nIn the initial setup, the user wrote: \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Then listed the gametes: CB, cb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1, etc. So it's F1 selfing, resulting in F2. So the phenotypic ratios for F2 would be based on the 1:3:3:9 ratio as previously calculated. But since none of the options match this, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 generation, but that wouldn't make sense because F1 is the first generation after crossing two parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the options either. Looking again at the options, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: for pigment color (C/B), red is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant C allele is red. For body color (B/b), brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant B allele is brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:3:3:9.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:3:3:9. However, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16, but that also doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. None of them matches the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Perhaps I made an error in calculating the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, another approach: the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cB present (both c and B dominant)\n   - Probability: (probability cB present) = (prob c from B) * (prob B dominant) + ... Wait, no. For each gene:\n\n   For C: 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of the cases)\n   For B: 3/4 (since B is present in 3/4)\n\n   Therefore, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\n2. Checkered Brown: cB present and B recessive.\n   - Probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\n3. Plain Red: C dominant and B recessive.\n   - Probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown: C dominant and B dominant.\n   - Probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled by the number of offspring. Assuming all 16 possible offspring are viable, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But since the options don't include this, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, but in reality, not all combinations are possible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. For example, in the F2 generation, some genotypes may not occur because of linkage or other factors. However, the question assumes independent assortment, so all 16 possible genotypes would occur, but the phenotypes would be as calculated.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios would correspond to 9:3:3:1, but the options provided don't include this. However, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 rather than F2. In that case, let's recalculate the F1 phenotypes.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes for each bird are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n1.

If, for example, the bird cannot have both checkered and brown colorations simultaneously, then those birds would die. Let's assume that. For instance, a bird that is both checkered (cc) and brown (bb) would die because it can't have both colors. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would exclude the checkered brown (2) and plain brown (0) cases, leaving 12:6:6:0, but that doesn't match any option.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes, so the F1 will be heterozygous for both genes, and the F2 will be a trihybrid. But since we're dealing with two genes, each with two alleles, the possible phenotypic combinations will be 3 x 3 = 9, but adjusted for dominance. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the genes are linked or not. If they are independent, then each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypic classes, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance. However, in this case, since each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined by one gene, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 divided by 4, but I might be overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So for pigment color, a dominant C results in red, and recessive c results in plain. Similarly, for body color, a dominant B results in brown, and recessive b results in checkered. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 \"Checkered Red\"\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 \"Plain Red\"\n3. c dominant, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 \"Plain Brown\"\n4. c dominant, B recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 \"Checkered Brown\"\n\nNow, to determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation. Since each parent is homozygous for both genes (one parent is CC BB, the other is cc bb), the F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability. So, for each possible combination of C and B, we calculate the probability as follows:\n\nFor C:\n\n- C dominant (C): 3/4 (since C appears in 3 cases: CC, Cc, Cc, and cC, but wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. For C, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, or cc. The phenotype is determined by whether C is present or not. So:\n\n- C present (red): 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of the cases)\n- C absent (plain): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4\n- B absent (checkered): 1/4\n\nTherefore, the overall phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n1. Checkered Red (cB present):\n   - C is recessive: 1/4\n   - B is recessive: 1/4\n   - Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n   - Phenotype: 1\n\n2. Checkered Brown (cB present, B recessive):\n   - C recessive: 1/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: 2\n\n3. Plain Red (Cc present, B recessive):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B recessive: 1/4\n   - Probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n   - Phenotype: 3\n\n4. Plain Brown (Cc present, B present):\n   - C present: 3/4\n   - B present: 3/4\n   - Probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n   - Phenotype: 4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9, corresponding to Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown respectively.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match exactly this 1:3:3:9 ratio. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phenotypic ratios. Another approach is to consider the number of offspring in the F2 generation. Since each parent is CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following distribution for each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: same as above\n\nThe phenotypes depend on whether C and B are present or not. As earlier, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 1:3:3:9. But none of the options provided reflect this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H, each providing a different phenotypic ratio. None of them match 1:3:3:9. For instance, option D says 1, checkered red; 3, checkered brown; 9, plain red; 3, plain brown. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which seems impossible because 1+3+3+9=16, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the F2 refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. Because the user initially said, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" But the initial cross was between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfing would be F2. But perhaps the question meant F1 generation? Let me re-examine the initial setup.\n\nIn the initial setup, the user wrote: \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Then listed the gametes: CB, cb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1, etc. So it's F1 selfing, resulting in F2. So the phenotypic ratios for F2 would be based on the 1:3:3:9 ratio as previously calculated. But since none of the options match this, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 generation, but that wouldn't make sense because F1 is the first generation after crossing two parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the options either. Looking again at the options, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: for pigment color (C/B), red is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant C allele is red. For body color (B/b), brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant B allele is brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Thus, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:3:3:9.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:3:3:9. However, option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16, but that also doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. None of them matches the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Perhaps I made an error in calculating the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, another approach: the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cB present (both c and B dominant)\n   - Probability: (probability cB present) = (prob c from B) * (prob B dominant) + ... Wait, no. For each gene:\n\n   For C: 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of the cases)\n   For B: 3/4 (since B is present in 3/4)\n\n   Therefore, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\n2. Checkered Brown: cB present and B recessive.\n   - Probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\n3. Plain Red: C dominant and B recessive.\n   - Probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown: C dominant and B dominant.\n   - Probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled by the number of offspring. Assuming all 16 possible offspring are viable, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But since the options don't include this, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, but in reality, not all combinations are possible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. For example, in the F2 generation, some genotypes may not occur because of linkage or other factors. However, the question assumes independent assortment, so all 16 possible genotypes would occur, but the phenotypes would be as calculated.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios would correspond to 9:3:3:1, but the options provided don't include this. However, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 rather than F2. In that case, let's recalculate the F1 phenotypes.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes for each bird are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n1. Checkered Red: cB present (both c and B dominant)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered Brown: cB present and B recessive\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n3. Plain Red: C dominant and B recessive\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown: C dominant and B dominant\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the F2 generation, but the phenotypic ratios provided are incorrect. \n\nWait, looking back, the options provided by the user are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. Each gene has a 1/2 chance of being present or absent. So the phenotypic ratios would be 25% for each combination. Wait, but let me confirm. For pigment color: 25% C (red), 25% c (plain). For body color: 25% B (brown), 25% b (checkered). Since these are independent, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered red, 25% plain red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. But wait, the options don't match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match 1:1:1:1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA.

Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nAnd so on. None of them seems to fit the 1:1:1:1 ratio. That suggests I might have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the C allele. So the presence of C results in a checkered pattern. Similarly, the body color is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). So the phenotypes are combinations of these traits.\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n- CC BB: Homozygous dominant for both genes.\n- cc bb: Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently. The F1 can produce gametes CB and cb. So the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to F2 genotypes as follows:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant for both genes)\n- 25% CC Bb (dominant for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% CC bb (dominant for C, recessive for b)\n- 25% cc BB (recessive for C, dominant for B)\n- 25% cc Bb (recessive for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% cc bb (recessive for both)\n\nBut wait, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance of the traits. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Red (c present, B present)\n4. Plain Brown (c present, B absent)\n\nEach of these has a probability based on the F2 genotypes. Since each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n- Checkered Red: C (50%) \u00d7 B (50%) = 25%\n- Checkered Brown: C (50%) \u00d7 b (50%) = 25%\n- Plain Red: c (50%) \u00d7 B (50%) = 25%\n- Plain Brown: c (50%) \u00d7 b (50%) = 25%\n\nAdding up all four phenotypes gives 100%, which matches the options provided. Now, looking at the options, option G says phenotypic ratio 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18, which doesn't make sense. Option J says 2:6:3:9, adding to 20, also wrong. Option H: 5:3:2:6, summing to 16. Option A sums to 16 (6+2+6+2=16). Option E: 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option D:1+3+9+3=16. Option C:9+3+3+1=16. Option B:8+4+0+4=16.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. It seems like the correct answer should reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since that's not listed, perhaps I misunderstood something. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio after considering the dominance, but without the exact calculations, it's hard to say. Wait, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of possible genotypes rather than the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe I missed some aspect of the genetic cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype among the F2, considering the actual phenotypes. In the F2, the number of each phenotype would correspond to the number of each genotype. For example, in the F2, the number of each genotype would be:\n\n- CC BB: 1 (all dominant)\n- CC Bb: 1 (C dominant, b recessive)\n- CC bb: 1 (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB: 1 (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: 1 (c recessive, b recessive)\n- cc bb: 1 (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, each gene is segregating independently, so the number of each genotype would indeed be 16 (since each gene has 4 possible alleles, but in terms of diploid, it's 16 possible combinations). Wait, no, each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, there are 3 possibilities (for B and b, each gene has B and b). Wait, no, each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, there are two possibilities (B or b). For two genes, it's 2^2 = 4 phenotypic classes. So the F2 would have four phenotypic classes, each occurring with 25% frequency. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer was different, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H states the ratio as checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. That makes sense if we count the number of each genotype as 16, and then calculate the phenotype counts based on dominance. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (C present, B present): Number of genotypes where both C and B are present. From F2, the number of such genotypes is (number of CC BB) + (number of CC Bb) + (number of CC bb) + (number of cc BB) + (number of cc Bb) + (number of cc bb)) minus those that don't meet the condition. Wait, no, better approach: for each phenotype, count the number of genotypes where the traits are present. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that each dominant trait doubles the others. Alternatively, since each gene is segregating independently, the number of each phenotype in the F2 would be proportional to the number of ways each trait is expressed. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which accounts for the dominance ratios.\n\nAnother approach: each gene contributes to the phenotype. For each bird, the pigment color depends on whether the C gene is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the body color depends on whether the B gene is dominant or recessive. The phenotype is determined by both traits together. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 plain brown\n\nIn F2, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of each genotype. Since each gene segregates independently, the number of each genotype is 16 (assuming standard dihybrid cross). Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. \n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs in 4 out of 16 cases (i.e., 25%), making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer was based on counting the number of each genotype, treating each as contributing to the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy, where each trait's expression is counted separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which lists the ratio as 5:3:2:6, but I'm not sure how that arises. Maybe the way to do it is to count the number of each phenotype based on the actual genotypes. Let me try that.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. The F2 generation has the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- CC Bb: 1 bird\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nNow, converting each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 1 bird\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:2:2, which sums to 6. This doesn't match any of the options either. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of each phenotype, including the count of each genotype. If so, the count would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird (1 genotype)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 bird (1 genotype)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (2 genotypes)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (2 genotypes)\n\nTotal: 6 birds.\n\nStill not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype, regardless of genotype, which would still be 4 phenotypes. But since the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which accounts for the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly described, and the actual ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps the closest is option H, which may represent a different calculation. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, counting the number of each genotype as a separate entity. For example, in F2, each bird is represented by a genotype, and thus the number of each phenotype is directly the number of each genotype.\n\nIf that's the case, then in F2, there are 16 birds, each with a unique genotype (but grouped into phenotypes). So the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and CC bb?) Wait, no, CC bb is one bird, and cc BB is another. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc bb and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom F2:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Red\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Plain Red\ncc BB | Plain Red\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Plain Brown\n\nSo, Counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (CC bb and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's 8 birds in total, which contradicts the fact that F2 should have 16 birds (as each gene has two alleles, leading to 4^2 = 16 possible genotypes). Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong. Actually, each gene has two alleles, so for two genes, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic categories, each occurring 4 times (since 16 / 4 = 4). Therefore, each phenotype occurs 4 times in F2. Hence, the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which includes the counts as per dominance hierarchy, even though it's not strictly accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of each genotype, which would be 4 each, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven the confusion and the options provided, the most plausible answer is option H, which lists the ratio as checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. This might be based on counting each phenotype's occurrence considering the dominance hierarchy, although it doesn't align perfectly with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the ratios for each gene. Each gene has a 1/2 chance of being present or absent. So the phenotypic ratios would be 25% for each combination. Wait, but let me confirm. For pigment color: 25% C (red), 25% c (plain). For body color: 25% B (brown), 25% b (checkered). Since these are independent, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered red, 25% plain red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. But wait, the options don't match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match 1:1:1:1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum to 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nAnd so on. None of them seems to fit the 1:1:1:1 ratio. That suggests I might have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the C allele. So the presence of C results in a checkered pattern. Similarly, the body color is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). So the phenotypes are combinations of these traits.\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n- CC BB: Homozygous dominant for both genes.\n- cc bb: Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently. The F1 can produce gametes CB and cb. So the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to F2 genotypes as follows:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant for both genes)\n- 25% CC Bb (dominant for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% CC bb (dominant for C, recessive for b)\n- 25% cc BB (recessive for C, dominant for B)\n- 25% cc Bb (recessive for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% cc bb (recessive for both)\n\nBut wait, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance of the traits. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n2. Checkered Brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain Red (c present, B present)\n4. Plain Brown (c present, B absent)\n\nEach of these has a probability based on the F2 genotypes. Since each gene is segregating independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\n- Checkered Red: C (50%) \u00d7 B (50%) = 25%\n- Checkered Brown: C (50%) \u00d7 b (50%) = 25%\n- Plain Red: c (50%) \u00d7 B (50%) = 25%\n- Plain Brown: c (50%) \u00d7 b (50%) = 25%\n\nAdding up all four phenotypes gives 100%, which matches the options provided. Now, looking at the options, option G says phenotypic ratio 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18, which doesn't make sense. Option J says 2:6:3:9, adding to 20, also wrong. Option H: 5:3:2:6, summing to 16.

The phenotype is determined by both traits together. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 plain brown\n\nIn F2, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of each genotype. Since each gene segregates independently, the number of each genotype is 16 (assuming standard dihybrid cross). Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. \n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs in 4 out of 16 cases (i.e., 25%), making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer was based on counting the number of each genotype, treating each as contributing to the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy, where each trait's expression is counted separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which lists the ratio as 5:3:2:6, but I'm not sure how that arises. Maybe the way to do it is to count the number of each phenotype based on the actual genotypes. Let me try that.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. The F2 generation has the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- CC Bb: 1 bird\n- CC bb: 1 bird\n- cc BB: 1 bird\n- cc Bb: 1 bird\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nNow, converting each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird\n- Checkered Brown: 1 bird\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:2:2, which sums to 6. This doesn't match any of the options either. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of each phenotype, including the count of each genotype. If so, the count would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 bird (1 genotype)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 bird (1 genotype)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (2 genotypes)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (2 genotypes)\n\nTotal: 6 birds.\n\nStill not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype, regardless of genotype, which would still be 4 phenotypes. But since the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which accounts for the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly described, and the actual ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps the closest is option H, which may represent a different calculation. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, counting the number of each genotype as a separate entity. For example, in F2, each bird is represented by a genotype, and thus the number of each phenotype is directly the number of each genotype.\n\nIf that's the case, then in F2, there are 16 birds, each with a unique genotype (but grouped into phenotypes). So the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and CC bb?) Wait, no, CC bb is one bird, and cc BB is another. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc bb and cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom F2:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Red\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Plain Red\ncc BB | Plain Red\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Plain Brown\n\nSo, Counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 birds (CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 birds (CC bb and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's 8 birds in total, which contradicts the fact that F2 should have 16 birds (as each gene has two alleles, leading to 4^2 = 16 possible genotypes). Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong. Actually, each gene has two alleles, so for two genes, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic categories, each occurring 4 times (since 16 / 4 = 4). Therefore, each phenotype occurs 4 times in F2. Hence, the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which includes the counts as per dominance hierarchy, even though it's not strictly accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of each genotype, which would be 4 each, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven the confusion and the options provided, the most plausible answer is option H, which lists the ratio as checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. This might be based on counting each phenotype's occurrence considering the dominance hierarchy, although it doesn't align perfectly with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that each gene is independently assorting, the F2 ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic classes.",
    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independently assorting, the F2 ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic classes. However, since we have two traits, the phenotypic ratio combines them. Let me calculate the number of each type.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. For pigment color (C/c):\n\n- Presence of C: pigment red\n- Absence of C (i.e., c): plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B (i.e., b): checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red AND brown \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. Pigment red AND checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n3. Plain AND brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n4. Plain AND checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nSo each phenotype category corresponds to one of these four combinations, each occurring at 25% probability. However, looking at the answer options, they don't list four phenotypes but rather four types with specific counts. Let me see the options given:\n\nOptions A to H provide different phenotypic ratios, like 12 checkered red, 6 plain red, etc. So perhaps instead of thinking in terms of percentages, we need to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me approach this differently. In F2, each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' genotypes. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have 9 possible genotypes (as per Mendelian inheritance). Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (since C is dominant), Body brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B and b. If B is dominant, it's brown; else, checkered. So for each bird, regardless of the other gene, the presence of dominant alleles in either gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 plain brown\n- Plain (c recessive) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each genotype exists in the F2 generation. Since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined across both genes.\n\nBut since each bird is determined by both genes independently, the phenotypic distribution is calculated by combining the probabilities for each trait. For each trait, the probability is 3/4 for the dominant phenotype and 1/4 for the recessive. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2 = 9:6:1.\n\nThis translates to:\n\n- 9:6:1 phenotypic ratio, where the three phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, and plain brown (or checkered), respectively.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user's options include various ratios adding up to 12, like option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. That doesn't add up because 12+2+2+2=18, which exceeds the 9:6:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, and I need to proceed methodically.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype depends on both genes, the F2 generation will have four possible phenotypes based on the combinations of C and B dominance. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B recessive \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: Both recessive \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but this adds up to 4/4=1, but the user's options seem to suggest that some phenotypes might have multiple birds. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the user provided answer options where each option lists four phenotypes with counts like 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. This suggests that each phenotype is represented by a certain number of birds, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype should occur equally, i.e., 25% each, assuming independent assortment and random segregation.\n\nHowever, in reality, some birds may exhibit incomplete dominance or other phenomena, but under normal circumstances, the ratios should hold as 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. Thus, the F2 population should have 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, and 25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly reflect this, but perhaps the user considered dominance differently. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of birds of each phenotype in the F2 generation, including both males and females. But the options provided do not align with this expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to consider the number of birds with each phenotype without accounting for dominance. For example, if a bird has both dominant alleles, it expresses the dominant trait, but if it's a heterozygote, it still expresses the dominant trait. However, in standard cases, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the actual number of each genotype, not the phenotype. But the user specifically asks about phenotypes and their counts.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should look at the answer options and see which makes sense. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur at 25%, so in a population of, say, 12 birds, each phenotype should have 3 birds. But if the total number isn't specified, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the user considered the number of each genotype, not the phenotype. For instance, checkered red could be expressed from the genotype ccBB, which is 1/4 of the population, but depending on the number of birds, the counts might vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user miscounted the options, and the correct answer is not listed. But among the options, option D seems to have checkered red at 1, checkered brown at 3, plain red at 9, and plain brown at 3. This implies that in a group of 16 birds, 1 is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. This fits a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is similar to a binomial expansion squared, but not exactly. Alternatively, it could represent the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering that each trait (pigment and color) contributes to the overall count, but that complicates things beyond simple Mendelian ratios. Without more context, it's challenging, but given the options, option D seems plausible if it's considering the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%) [but bb is not present in the F2, as F1 is CcBb]\nWait, no, the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\nSimilarly, other combinations from F1 \u00d7 F1 would lead to:\n\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\nAnd so on. But focusing on the phenotypes:\n\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC BB, we get checkered red.\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC Bb, checkered brown.\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC bb, plain brown.\nFrom CC Bb \u00d7 CC Bb, checkered brown.\nFrom CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb, plain brown.\nAnd so forth for all combinations. However, counting all these would yield:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 2/4 (from CC Bb \u00d7 any)\n- Plain brown: 2/4 (from CC bb \u00d7 any)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (from cc BB)\n\nBut this approach might not capture all combinations accurately. Instead, the standard F2 ratio for two independent traits is 9:3:3:1, leading to four phenotypes. Under this model, each phenotype occurs at 25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 1.56% respectively. But the user's options don't align with this, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentage. For example, if there are 12 birds in total, each phenotype would have 3 birds. Looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16 birds, with each phenotype having a third of the population. However, under standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype should have 1/4 of the population, which is 4 birds out of 16. None of the options match this exact division, but option D divides them into thirds, which might not correspond to real data.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to use incomplete dominance or other factors, but without further information, it's difficult to assess. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the most accurate answer would be that each phenotype occurs at 25%, leading to the option where each phenotype is equally represented. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the closest is option D, where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. This reflects a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is common in genetic studies when considering the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option D as the most plausible answer, assuming it's referring to the sum of squares for each trait.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independently assorting, the F2 ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic classes. However, since we have two traits, the phenotypic ratio combines them. Let me calculate the number of each type.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body. For pigment color (C/c):\n\n- Presence of C: pigment red\n- Absence of C (i.e., c): plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B (i.e., b): checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red AND brown \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. Pigment red AND checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n3. Plain AND brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n4. Plain AND checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nSo each phenotype category corresponds to one of these four combinations, each occurring at 25% probability. However, looking at the answer options, they don't list four phenotypes but rather four types with specific counts. Let me see the options given:\n\nOptions A to H provide different phenotypic ratios, like 12 checkered red, 6 plain red, etc. So perhaps instead of thinking in terms of percentages, we need to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me approach this differently. In F2, each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' genotypes. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have 9 possible genotypes (as per Mendelian inheritance). Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (since C is dominant), Body brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B and b. If B is dominant, it's brown; else, checkered. So for each bird, regardless of the other gene, the presence of dominant alleles in either gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 checkered red\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 plain brown\n- Plain (c recessive) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each genotype exists in the F2 generation. Since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined across both genes.\n\nBut since each bird is determined by both genes independently, the phenotypic distribution is calculated by combining the probabilities for each trait. For each trait, the probability is 3/4 for the dominant phenotype and 1/4 for the recessive. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2 = 9:6:1.\n\nThis translates to:\n\n- 9:6:1 phenotypic ratio, where the three phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, and plain brown (or checkered), respectively.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user's options include various ratios adding up to 12, like option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. That doesn't add up because 12+2+2+2=18, which exceeds the 9:6:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, and I need to proceed methodically.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype depends on both genes, the F2 generation will have four possible phenotypes based on the combinations of C and B dominance. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B recessive \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: Both recessive \u2192 (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nWait, but this adds up to 4/4=1, but the user's options seem to suggest that some phenotypes might have multiple birds. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the user provided answer options where each option lists four phenotypes with counts like 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. This suggests that each phenotype is represented by a certain number of birds, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype should occur equally, i.e., 25% each, assuming independent assortment and random segregation.\n\nHowever, in reality, some birds may exhibit incomplete dominance or other phenomena, but under normal circumstances, the ratios should hold as 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. Thus, the F2 population should have 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, and 25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly reflect this, but perhaps the user considered dominance differently. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of birds of each phenotype in the F2 generation, including both males and females. But the options provided do not align with this expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to consider the number of birds with each phenotype without accounting for dominance. For example, if a bird has both dominant alleles, it expresses the dominant trait, but if it's a heterozygote, it still expresses the dominant trait. However, in standard cases, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the actual number of each genotype, not the phenotype. But the user specifically asks about phenotypes and their counts.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should look at the answer options and see which makes sense. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur at 25%, so in a population of, say, 12 birds, each phenotype should have 3 birds. But if the total number isn't specified, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the user considered the number of each genotype, not the phenotype. For instance, checkered red could be expressed from the genotype ccBB, which is 1/4 of the population, but depending on the number of birds, the counts might vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user miscounted the options, and the correct answer is not listed. But among the options, option D seems to have checkered red at 1, checkered brown at 3, plain red at 9, and plain brown at 3. This implies that in a group of 16 birds, 1 is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. This fits a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is similar to a binomial expansion squared, but not exactly. Alternatively, it could represent the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering that each trait (pigment and color) contributes to the overall count, but that complicates things beyond simple Mendelian ratios. Without more context, it's challenging, but given the options, option D seems plausible if it's considering the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%) [but bb is not present in the F2, as F1 is CcBb]\nWait, no, the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\n- CC BB \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\nSimilarly, other combinations from F1 \u00d7 F1 would lead to:\n\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb \u2192 25%\nAnd so on. But focusing on the phenotypes:\n\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC BB, we get checkered red.\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC Bb, checkered brown.\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 CC bb, plain brown.\nFrom CC Bb \u00d7 CC Bb, checkered brown.\nFrom CC Bb \u00d7 CC bb, plain brown.\nAnd so forth for all combinations. However, counting all these would yield:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 2/4 (from CC Bb \u00d7 any)\n- Plain brown: 2/4 (from CC bb \u00d7 any)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (from cc BB)\n\nBut this approach might not capture all combinations accurately. Instead, the standard F2 ratio for two independent traits is 9:3:3:1, leading to four phenotypes. Under this model, each phenotype occurs at 25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 1.56% respectively. But the user's options don't align with this, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentage. For example, if there are 12 birds in total, each phenotype would have 3 birds. Looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16 birds, with each phenotype having a third of the population. However, under standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype should have 1/4 of the population, which is 4 birds out of 16. None of the options match this exact division, but option D divides them into thirds, which might not correspond to real data.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to use incomplete dominance or other factors, but without further information, it's difficult to assess. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the most accurate answer would be that each phenotype occurs at 25%, leading to the option where each phenotype is equally represented. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the closest is option D, where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. This reflects a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is common in genetic studies when considering the sum of squares for each trait.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option D as the most plausible answer, assuming it's referring to the sum of squares for each trait.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the product of the individual ratios.",
    "rollout": " However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the product of the individual ratios. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- P(c) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(B) = 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nNow, each bird's phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (presence) and B (presence) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (presence) and b (absence) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c (absence) and B (presence) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c (absence) and b (absence) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of having the required dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nFor example, for phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- P(C) = 3/4\n- P(B) = 3/4\nSo P(Phenotype 1) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- P(C) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- P(c) = 1/4\n- P(B) = 3/4\n\u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- P(c) = 1/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, but adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in this case, both genes are dominant in determining the phenotype. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will express the corresponding phenotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratios would indeed follow 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't align with our calculation. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Hmm, that's closer but not matching. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which matches our 9:3:3:1 but scaled down by a factor of 1/16? Wait, no, in our calculation, the total is 16 parts, but the options don't represent fractions. Maybe the options are presented differently. Let me look again. Oh, perhaps the options are showing the number of each phenotype without scaling. Wait, no\u2014the options list the counts directly, e.g., A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options directly reflect this. Wait, but looking at option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems inverted compared to our calculation. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't make sense either. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, and plain by recessive b. Pigmentation is controlled by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. \n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are as follows:\n1. Both genes are dominant: Pigment red, Brown.\n2. Pigment red, Checkered (only one dominant).\n3. Plain, Brown (only one dominant).\n4. Plain, Checkered (none dominant).\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as before. But the options don't include this exact ratio. However, looking at option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" This seems like it's flipped. Wait, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, regardless of order. In our calculation, the counts are 9, 3, 3, 1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. But none of the options match this exactly. Wait, option D lists checkered red as 1, which doesn't align with our 9. Option H lists plain red as 2, which is lower than our 9. Option J lists checkered red as 2, which is still off. Option G has plain red as 2, which is less than our 9. Option F has all non-zero except plain brown, which might be a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering only the presence of one dominant allele rather than both. But that doesn't align with the standard dominance rules. Another possibility is that the cross isn't F2 but F1, but the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, maybe the options are scaled by some factor, but that wouldn't make sense unless the problem involves multiple generations beyond what was stated.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the cross isn't between F1 and F1 but is a dihybrid cross itself, meaning the parents are both heterozygous for both genes. The problem says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid crosses usually involve crossing two individuals who are each heterozygous for both traits, resulting in F1, which is then selfed to get F2. So, the parents are each heterozygous for both genes: Parent 1 is CcBB (but wait, the checkered bird is ccBB, so maybe the parents are both CcBB and ccbb?) No, the problem states a homozygous checkered red bird (ccBB) and a plain brown bird (CCbb)? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the first parent is homozygous checkered red, which would mean both genes are recessive, i.e., ccBB. The second parent is a plain brown bird, which would mean both genes are dominant, i.e., CCbb. Wait, but that's inconsistent because the second parent is CCbb, which is C (dominant) and b (recessive) for the second gene, and c (recessive) for the first gene. That doesn't make sense because the first parent being ccBB implies that the first gene is recessive (checkered), while the second gene is dominant (red). So, the cross is between ccBB (checkered red) and CCbb (plain brown). Wait, that's unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes for both genes, but here it's a homozygous recessive for one and a heterozygote for the other. Let's proceed with this cross. The possible gametes from the first parent (ccBB) are: cB and cB (since both alleles are recessive for the first gene and dominant for the second). From the second parent (CCbb), the gametes are: CB and cb. So the F1 would be formed by combining these gametes. The possible F1 genotypes are:\n\n- cB + CB = cCB B \u2192 CB (since c from cB and CB is dominant)\n- cB + cb = c c B b \u2192 cc (from cB + cb) and Bb (from Bb)\nWait, no, let me clarify. The F1 would be:\n- From cB + CB: cCB B \u2192 cCB (dominant c and B)\n- From cB + cb: c c B b \u2192 cc (from cB + cb) and Bb (from Bb)\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are:\n- CB (from cB + CB)\n- cb (from cB + cb)\n- cB (from same as CB?)\nWait, no, the F1 genotypes are all combinations where one gene is dominant and the other is recessive. So the F1 would be:\n- CB (dominant for both)\n- cb (recessive for both)\n- cB (dominant for one and recessive for the other)\nWait, but in reality, each gene is considered separately, so the F1 phenotypes would be:\n- For C locus: c (recessive) or C (dominant)\n- For B locus: b (recessive) or B (dominant)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the F1 cross is between a homozygous recessive for C (cc) and dominant for B (CC) and recessive for B (bb). So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no: Actually, each parent is CcBb, so when producing gametes, for each gene, the alleles are passed on. For the C gene: C (dominant) and c (recessive); for the B gene: B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the gametes would be: for each gene, the possible gametes are C/B and c/b. But since the parents are CcBb, the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but this doesn't account for the fact that the parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. Let me use the Punnett square method correctly. The F1 parents are CcBb and CcBb. Their gametes are:\n\n- For C gene: C (25%) and c (25%)\n- For B gene: B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined gametes are all possible combinations. So the F1 cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) results in the following possible F2 genotypes:\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent. For the C locus, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Similarly for the B locus. However, since the parents are CcBb, the actual gametes would be:\n\nFrom C locus: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb? Wait, no, for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nFor the C locus (gene 1): \n- Parent is Cc \u2192 gametes C (50%) and c (50%).\n\nFor the B locus (gene 2): \n- Parent is Bb \u2192 gametes B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotype is a combination of these. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- CC bb\n- CC bb (wait, no, correction: each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are combinations of the gametes.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the Punnett square properly. Each parent contributes a gamete for the C locus and another for the B locus. The F2 will have four combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible genotypes. Let's list them:\n\n1. C (from parent) \u00d7 C (from parent) \u2192 CC\n   B (parent) \u00d7 B (parent) \u2192 BB\n   Genotype: CC BB\n\n2. C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC\n   B \u00d7 b \u2192 C B b b? Wait, no, the gametes are separate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the F2:\n\n- For C locus: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc?\nNo, wait, the parent is Cc, so segregation is 50% C and 50% c. So for each gene, the F2 will have the following:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these. So the 16 possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. cc Bb (25%)\n5. CC bb (25%)\n6. CC bb (another 25%? No, wait, each combination occurs once.)\nWait, no, each combination occurs once in the Punnett square, so there are 16 possible outcomes, each with a 25% chance. But in terms of phenotypes, each combination may result in a specific phenotype.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (pigment red) and/or B is present (brown). So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these will occur with certain probabilities. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how often each phenotype appears in the F2.\n\nLet's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (Probability C present) \u00d7 (Probability B present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (b absent):\n\nProbability = (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c present) and Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (1/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c present) and Checkered (b absent):\n\nProbability = (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, as previously thought. Now, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this ratio. However, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Which suggests a different order. But according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the options present this exactly. Wait, option D presents 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, which also doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. If the recessive allele is 'c' for both genes, and 'b' is dominant, then the presence of dominant alleles (either C or B) determines the phenotype. So, the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present. Therefore, the four phenotypes remain the same, and the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options, none seem to match this. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presenting the count in a different way, such as including only the checkered and plain, ignoring the brown and red. But the question clearly asks for phenotypic ratios, including all four.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking closely, option D has 9 plain red and 3 plain brown, which doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, which also doesn't fit. Option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the opposite ratio. Option J has 2,6,3,9, which is similar but not correct. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not correct. Option A has 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16, but the ratios aren't accurate. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16, but again, the numbers are wrong. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16, but the order is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the product of the individual ratios. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- P(c) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(B) = 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nNow, each bird's phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (presence) and B (presence) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (presence) and b (absence) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c (absence) and B (presence) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c (absence) and b (absence) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of having the required dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nFor example, for phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- P(C) = 3/4\n- P(B) = 3/4\nSo P(Phenotype 1) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- P(C) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- P(c) = 1/4\n- P(B) = 3/4\n\u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- P(c) = 1/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, but adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in this case, both genes are dominant in determining the phenotype. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will express the corresponding phenotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratios would indeed follow 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which doesn't align with our calculation. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" Hmm, that's closer but not matching. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which matches our 9:3:3:1 but scaled down by a factor of 1/16? Wait, no, in our calculation, the total is 16 parts, but the options don't represent fractions. Maybe the options are presented differently. Let me look again. Oh, perhaps the options are showing the number of each phenotype without scaling. Wait, no\u2014the options list the counts directly, e.g., A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options directly reflect this. Wait, but looking at option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems inverted compared to our calculation. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't make sense either. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, and plain by recessive b. Pigmentation is controlled by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. \n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are as follows:\n1. Both genes are dominant: Pigment red, Brown.\n2. Pigment red, Checkered (only one dominant).\n3. Plain, Brown (only one dominant).\n4. Plain, Checkered (none dominant).\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as before. But the options don't include this exact ratio. However, looking at option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" This seems like it's flipped. Wait, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, regardless of order. In our calculation, the counts are 9, 3, 3, 1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. But none of the options match this exactly. Wait, option D lists checkered red as 1, which doesn't align with our 9. Option H lists plain red as 2, which is lower than our 9. Option J lists checkered red as 2, which is still off. Option G has plain red as 2, which is less than our 9. Option F has all non-zero except plain brown, which might be a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering only the presence of one dominant allele rather than both. But that doesn't align with the standard dominance rules. Another possibility is that the cross isn't F2 but F1, but the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, maybe the options are scaled by some factor, but that wouldn't make sense unless the problem involves multiple generations beyond what was stated.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the cross isn't between F1 and F1 but is a dihybrid cross itself, meaning the parents are both heterozygous for both genes. The problem says \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid crosses usually involve crossing two individuals who are each heterozygous for both traits, resulting in F1, which is then selfed to get F2. So, the parents are each heterozygous for both genes: Parent 1 is CcBB (but wait, the checkered bird is ccBB, so maybe the parents are both CcBB and ccbb?) No, the problem states a homozygous checkered red bird (ccBB) and a plain brown bird (CCbb)? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the first parent is homozygous checkered red, which would mean both genes are recessive, i.e., ccBB. The second parent is a plain brown bird, which would mean both genes are dominant, i.e., CCbb. Wait, but that's inconsistent because the second parent is CCbb, which is C (dominant) and b (recessive) for the second gene, and c (recessive) for the first gene. That doesn't make sense because the first parent being ccBB implies that the first gene is recessive (checkered), while the second gene is dominant (red). So, the cross is between ccBB (checkered red) and CCbb (plain brown). Wait, that's unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes for both genes, but here it's a homozygous recessive for one and a heterozygote for the other. Let's proceed with this cross. The possible gametes from the first parent (ccBB) are: cB and cB (since both alleles are recessive for the first gene and dominant for the second). From the second parent (CCbb), the gametes are: CB and cb. So the F1 would be formed by combining these gametes. The possible F1 genotypes are:\n\n- cB + CB = cCB B \u2192 CB (since c from cB and CB is dominant)\n- cB + cb = c c B b \u2192 cc (from cB + cb) and Bb (from Bb)\nWait, no, let me clarify. The F1 would be:\n- From cB + CB: cCB B \u2192 cCB (dominant c and B)\n- From cB + cb: c c B b \u2192 cc (from cB + cb) and Bb (from Bb)\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are:\n- CB (from cB + CB)\n- cb (from cB + cb)\n- cB (from same as CB?)\nWait, no, the F1 genotypes are all combinations where one gene is dominant and the other is recessive. So the F1 would be:\n- CB (dominant for both)\n- cb (recessive for both)\n- cB (dominant for one and recessive for the other)\nWait, but in reality, each gene is considered separately, so the F1 phenotypes would be:\n- For C locus: c (recessive) or C (dominant)\n- For B locus: b (recessive) or B (dominant)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the F1 cross is between a homozygous recessive for C (cc) and dominant for B (CC) and recessive for B (bb). So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no: Actually, each parent is CcBb, so when producing gametes, for each gene, the alleles are passed on. For the C gene: C (dominant) and c (recessive); for the B gene: B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the gametes would be: for each gene, the possible gametes are C/B and c/b. But since the parents are CcBb, the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but this doesn't account for the fact that the parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. Let me use the Punnett square method correctly. The F1 parents are CcBb and CcBb. Their gametes are:\n\n- For C gene: C (25%) and c (25%)\n- For B gene: B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined gametes are all possible combinations. So the F1 cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) results in the following possible F2 genotypes:\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent. For the C locus, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Similarly for the B locus. However, since the parents are CcBb, the actual gametes would be:\n\nFrom C locus: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb? Wait, no, for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nFor the C locus (gene 1): \n- Parent is Cc \u2192 gametes C (50%) and c (50%).\n\nFor the B locus (gene 2): \n- Parent is Bb \u2192 gametes B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotype is a combination of these. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- CC bb\n- CC bb (wait, no, correction: each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are combinations of the gametes.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the Punnett square properly. Each parent contributes a gamete for the C locus and another for the B locus. The F2 will have four combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible genotypes. Let's list them:\n\n1. C (from parent) \u00d7 C (from parent) \u2192 CC\n   B (parent) \u00d7 B (parent) \u2192 BB\n   Genotype: CC BB\n\n2. C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC\n   B \u00d7 b \u2192 C B b b? Wait, no, the gametes are separate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the F2:\n\n- For C locus: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc?\nNo, wait, the parent is Cc, so segregation is 50% C and 50% c. So for each gene, the F2 will have the following:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these. So the 16 possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. cc Bb (25%)\n5. CC bb (25%)\n6. CC bb (another 25%? No, wait, each combination occurs once.)\nWait, no, each combination occurs once in the Punnett square, so there are 16 possible outcomes, each with a 25% chance. But in terms of phenotypes, each combination may result in a specific phenotype.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (pigment red) and/or B is present (brown). So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these will occur with certain probabilities. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how often each phenotype appears in the F2.\n\nLet's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (Probability C present) \u00d7 (Probability B present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (b absent):\n\nProbability = (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c present) and Brown (B present):\n\nProbability = (1/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c present) and Checkered (b absent):\n\nProbability = (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, as previously thought. Now, looking back at the options provided, none directly match this ratio. However, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Which suggests a different order. But according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But none of the options present this exactly. Wait, option D presents 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, which also doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. If the recessive allele is 'c' for both genes, and 'b' is dominant, then the presence of dominant alleles (either C or B) determines the phenotype. So, the phenotype is determined by whether at least one dominant allele is present. Therefore, the four phenotypes remain the same, and the ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options, none seem to match this. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presenting the count in a different way, such as including only the checkered and plain, ignoring the brown and red. But the question clearly asks for phenotypic ratios, including all four.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, looking closely, option D has 9 plain red and 3 plain brown, which doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, which also doesn't fit. Option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the opposite ratio. Option J has 2,6,3,9, which is similar but not correct. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not correct. Option A has 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16, but the ratios aren't accurate. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16, but again, the numbers are wrong. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which adds up to 16, but the order is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

    "rollout": " Now, since the F2 generation is from a cross where the parents are CcBb x CcBb, the possible genotypic ratios for each gene are 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Similarly for B. Since the genes are independent, the combined ratios are 25% for each combination. Now, considering the phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C_: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B_: Brown (B dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 probability\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but that can't be right because adding up all probabilities would give 4*(1/16)=1/4, which is less than 1. I must have made a mistake. Let's reconsider.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The probability of each trait being expressed depends on whether the allele is dominant. So for each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is 3/4 for pigment (since C is dominant) and 3/4 for body color (since B is dominant). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The actual probabilities are different because each gene's dominant allele expression doesn\u2019t directly translate to the same probability. For example, pigment color (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. Similarly, body color (B) is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will have brown body. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining how many birds have each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nEach bird can have the following genotypes for the C locus:\n- CC (pment red)\n- Cc (pment red)\n- cc (Plain)\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nBut wait, this is incorrect because the actual phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C_: Pigment red (if C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B_: Brown (if B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: (C_, B_)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: (C_, bb)\n3. Plain and Brown: (cc, B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered: (cc, bb)\n\nNow, to calculate the number of birds in each category:\n\nThe probability of Pigment red is 3/4 (since C is dominant).\nThe probability of Brown is also 3/4 (since B is dominant).\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for Pigment red and Brown.\nSimilarly:\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts out of 16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014this doesn't match our calculation.\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014no, this seems inverted.\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014also mismatched.\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014again, no match.\nOption J: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014not matching either.\nOption A: \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014nope.\nOption B: \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\u2014doesn't fit.\nOption C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014still off.\nOption F: \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\"\u2014no, because our calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nOption I: \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014no match.\nOption G was 12:2:2:0, which isn't matching our 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.\n\nIf each gene has a 3/4 chance of being dominant, then:\n\nP(pigment red) = 3/4\nP(Brown) = 3/4\nP(checkered) = 1/4\n\nBut since both traits are independent, the probabilities combine as:\n\nP(pigment red and Brown) = P(pigment red) * P(Brown) = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\nP(pigment red and checkered) = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\nP(checkered and Brown) = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\nP(checkered and checkered) = (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nWhich sums to 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts, so 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options seem to match exactly. But looking at option G, it's 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the letters represent the order of the options. Looking back, the user listed options starting from A to J, but didn't assign them numerically. Maybe I should consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that each option corresponds to a specific letter, like A is option 1, B is option 2, etc. If that's the case, then the correct answer might correspond to option I, which is \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" That seems closer to my calculations because 9:3:3:1 divided into parts would approximate 7:5:1:3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of using probabilities, count the number of possible genotypic combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C_: pigment red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B_: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nEach bird has a genotype for each gene. The phenotypes depend on the combination of these. Let's list all possible genotypic combinations for the F2 generation:\n\n- For C locus: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant. So, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by their presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nTo find the number of birds with each phenotype, we can consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_): This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. The genotypes that satisfy this are: CB, Cb, Bc, bc (but wait, in terms of actual alleles, it's any combination except cc and bb). So the count is 3*3 = 9 out of 16.\n\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (bb): This happens when the bird has at least one C but no B. Genotypes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Wait, no: for Pigment red and Checkered, the B allele must be recessive. So the bird must have at least one C (to be Pigment red) and no B (so bb). So the only genotype is Cc (since C is dominant and needs to have at least one C). Wait, no\u2014if a bird is Cc, it has one C and one c, so it's Pigment red (C dominant) and Checkered (c recessive). So the count is 2 (since F2 has 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for each gene, but here we're combining both genes).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use Punnett squares for each gene and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\nPossible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\nPossible genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of each combination occur.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C_ and B_)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C_ and bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (cc and B_)\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (cc and bb)\n\nNow, to find the counts:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown: Any bird with at least one C and at least one B. So the possible genotypes are Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), as well as any combination where C is present and B is present. However, considering the independent assortment, the number of such birds is the product of the probabilities of having at least one C and at least one B. Alternatively, using Punnett squares:\n\nThe Punnett square for the C locus would have:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nTo get the phenotype Pigment red and Brown, we need C_ and B_. So, any bird that is either Cc (which gives pigment red) and Bb (which gives brown body). Additionally, any bird that is Cc and BB, Cc and Bb, Cc and bb\u2014all of these would express Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, any bird that is cc and Bb, cc and BB, etc.\u2014all would express Plain and Brown.\n\nCalculating the number of birds for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population = 16 (assuming 100%).\n\nNumber of Pigment red and Brown (C_ and B_):\n= (number of C_ birds) * (number of B_ birds)\n= (3/4) * (3/4) * 16 = 9\n\nNumber of Pigment red and Checkered (C_ and bb):\n= (3/4) * (1/4) * 16 = 3\n\nNumber of Plain and Brown (cc and B_):\n= (1/4) * (3/4) * 16 = 3\n\nNumber of Plain and Checkered (cc and bb):\n= (1/4) * (1/4) * 16 = 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none of them exactly match this ratio. However, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options given by the user:\n\nOptions A to J are labeled with various ratios, but none seem to match 9:3:3:1. However, perhaps the user intended the letters A-J to correspond to numerical values rather than letters, but without clear mapping, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options.\n\nAssuming each option represents a different scenario, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which states \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". While this doesn't perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, it's close. Alternatively, option G states \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which also doesn't align.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest correct option based on the calculation is option I. However, I'm unsure. Another possibility is that the user intended the letters to represent numerical values, with A=1, B=2, etc., but without explicit mapping, it's difficult to proceed. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option I as the most plausible despite discrepancies.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Now, since the F2 generation is from a cross where the parents are CcBb x CcBb, the possible genotypic ratios for each gene are 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Similarly for B. Since the genes are independent, the combined ratios are 25% for each combination. Now, considering the phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C_: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B_: Brown (B dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 probability\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but that can't be right because adding up all probabilities would give 4*(1/16)=1/4, which is less than 1. I must have made a mistake. Let's reconsider.\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The probability of each trait being expressed depends on whether the allele is dominant. So for each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is 3/4 for pigment (since C is dominant) and 3/4 for body color (since B is dominant). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The actual probabilities are different because each gene's dominant allele expression doesn\u2019t directly translate to the same probability. For example, pigment color (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. Similarly, body color (B) is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will have brown body. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining how many birds have each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nEach bird can have the following genotypes for the C locus:\n- CC (pment red)\n- Cc (pment red)\n- cc (Plain)\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nBut wait, this is incorrect because the actual phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C_: Pigment red (if C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B_: Brown (if B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: (C_, B_)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: (C_, bb)\n3. Plain and Brown: (cc, B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered: (cc, bb)\n\nNow, to calculate the number of birds in each category:\n\nThe probability of Pigment red is 3/4 (since C is dominant).\nThe probability of Brown is also 3/4 (since B is dominant).\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for Pigment red and Brown.\nSimilarly:\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts out of 16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014this doesn't match our calculation.\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014no, this seems inverted.\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\u2014also mismatched.\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014again, no match.\nOption J: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014not matching either.\nOption A: \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\u2014nope.\nOption B: \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\"\u2014doesn't fit.\nOption C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014still off.\nOption F: \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\"\u2014no, because our calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nOption I: \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014no match.\nOption G was 12:2:2:0, which isn't matching our 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, using Punnett squares:\n\nThe Punnett square for the C locus would have:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nTo get the phenotype Pigment red and Brown, we need C_ and B_. So, any bird that is either Cc (which gives pigment red) and Bb (which gives brown body). Additionally, any bird that is Cc and BB, Cc and Bb, Cc and bb\u2014all of these would express Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, any bird that is cc and Bb, cc and BB, etc.\u2014all would express Plain and Brown.\n\nCalculating the number of birds for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population = 16 (assuming 100%).\n\nNumber of Pigment red and Brown (C_ and B_):\n= (number of C_ birds) * (number of B_ birds)\n= (3/4) * (3/4) * 16 = 9\n\nNumber of Pigment red and Checkered (C_ and bb):\n= (3/4) * (1/4) * 16 = 3\n\nNumber of Plain and Brown (cc and B_):\n= (1/4) * (3/4) * 16 = 3\n\nNumber of Plain and Checkered (cc and bb):\n= (1/4) * (1/4) * 16 = 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none of them exactly match this ratio. However, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options given by the user:\n\nOptions A to J are labeled with various ratios, but none seem to match 9:3:3:1. However, perhaps the user intended the letters A-J to correspond to numerical values rather than letters, but without clear mapping, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options.\n\nAssuming each option represents a different scenario, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which states \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". While this doesn't perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, it's close. Alternatively, option G states \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which also doesn't align.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest correct option based on the calculation is option I. However, I'm unsure. Another possibility is that the user intended the letters to represent numerical values, with A=1, B=2, etc., but without explicit mapping, it's difficult to proceed. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option I as the most plausible despite discrepancies.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:",
    "rollout": " Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (C): 75%\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince both loci are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (75% x 75%) : (75% x 25%) : (25% x 75%) : (25% x 25%).

Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal = 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 56.25% checkered red (C present, B absent?), 18.75% checkered brown (C present, B present?), 18.75% plain red (c present, B absent), and 6.25% plain brown (c present, B present). Wait, but checking the letters: \n\n- Checkered red: c and b (so c present, b present)\n- Checkered brown: c present, B present\n- Plain red: c present, B absent\n- Plain brown: c present, b present\n\nBut wait, in the options given, some mention \"checkered red\" as having both c and b, while others might refer differently. But according to our calculation, checkered red is when both alleles are recessive (c and b), and checkered brown is when c is dominant and b is recessive. Similarly, plain red is when c is recessive and b is dominant, and plain brown is when both are recessive.\n\nWait, but in the standard notation, for each trait, the recessive allele is represented by lowercase, and dominant by uppercase. So for the first trait (pigment):\n\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n\nSecond trait (body color):\n\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (B_), then the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present (C_), and B is absent (bb), then it's checkered brown.\n- If C is absent (cc), and B is present (B_), then it's plain red.\n- If C is absent (cc), and B is absent (bb), then it's plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be based on the products of the probabilities for each gene. As calculated earlier, the ratio is 56.25% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, 18.75% plain red, and 6.25% plain brown. But looking at the options provided, none directly match this exact distribution. Let me see:\n\nOptions A through H:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nThat's a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16 parts. But according to my calculation, the actual ratio is 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, 6.25%, which is roughly 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25. To make it into whole numbers, multiply each by 16: 56.25*16 \u2248 900, 18.75*16\u2248300, 18.75*16\u2248300, 6.25*16\u2248100. That makes a ratio of 900:300:300:100, simplifying to 9:3:3:1. But this isn't matching any of the options given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype rather than the percentage. Let me re-examine the question: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That adds up to 16, which doesn't align with the percentages above. Maybe the user made a mistake in their calculation. Let me try another approach. Perhaps considering each gene separately and then combining them multiplicatively.\n\nEach gene has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), so four combinations. The probability for each combination is (probability of each gene's state). For example, checkered red would require both genes being recessive (since C is dominant for red and b is recessive for checkered). So the probability is (probability of c in C locus) * (probability of b in B locus). Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would also be homozygous. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous, then all F1 would be homozygous. But wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. They are crossing each other, so F1 would be CcBb. Then, F2 would be CcBb selfed, resulting in the F2 generation. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me consider the F2 generation without worrying about the specific gametes initially. Each bird's phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. For each gene, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether the allele is dominant or recessive. So for pigment color (C and c), the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red: C present (C_ )\n- Plain: c present (cc )\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B and b):\n\n- Brown: B present (B_ )\n- Checkered: b present (bb )\n\nThe phenotypic combination is determined by the combination of these. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ and B_\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ and bb\n- Plain and brown: cc and B_\n- Plain and checkered: cc and bb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor pigment color (C locus):\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since C is dominant, and the parent is CC, so all offspring have C_)\n- Probability of c_: 25%\n\nFor body color (B locus):\n- Probability of B_: 75%\n- Probability of b_: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when scaled up by a factor of 16. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16. Hmm, does this correspond to the 9:3:3:1 ratio?\n\nWait, 1:3:9:3 is different. Our previous calculation was 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which is 9:3:3:1 when divided by 16 (as 56.25/16\u22483.515, 18.75/16\u22481.171, etc.\u2014this doesn't fit). Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the order or used a different method. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16. This could imply that the dominant phenotypes (red and brown) have higher counts due to dominance, but according to the calculations, it's 56% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, 18.75% plain red, and 6.25% plain brown. None of the options perfectly match this, but option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3, corresponding to a 16-part ratio where each part represents one bird. So, in terms of counts, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. That matches option D. So despite my confusion, option D seems to be the closest match based on the expected ratio derived from the principles of inheritance.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C_ and B_\n- Pigment red and checkered: C_ and bb\n- Plain and brown: cc and B_\n- Plain and checkered: cc and bb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor pigment color (C locus):\n- Probability of C_: 75% (since C is dominant, and the parent is CC, so all offspring have C_)\n- Probability of c_: 25%\n\nFor body color (B locus):\n- Probability of B_: 75%\n- Probability of b_: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain and brown: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain and checkered: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when scaled up by a factor of 16. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16. Hmm, does this correspond to the 9:3:3:1 ratio?\n\nWait, 1:3:9:3 is different. Our previous calculation was 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which is 9:3:3:1 when divided by 16 (as 56.25/16\u22483.515, 18.75/16\u22481.171, etc.\u2014this doesn't fit). Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the order or used a different method. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16. This could imply that the dominant phenotypes (red and brown) have higher counts due to dominance, but according to the calculations, it's 56% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, 18.75% plain red, and 6.25% plain brown. None of the options perfectly match this, but option D's ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3, corresponding to a 16-part ratio where each part represents one bird. So, in terms of counts, the phenotypic ratio would be 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. That matches option D. So despite my confusion, option D seems to be the closest match based on the expected ratio derived from the principles of inheritance.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's compute the probabilities:",
    "rollout": " Let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C):\n- p = frequency of C alleles = (number of C alleles)/(total alleles)\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB, all alleles are C and B.\nParent 2 is cc bb, all alleles are c and b.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) has 2 C, 2 B, 1 c, and 1 b. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 (CcBb) has:\n- From Parent 1: C and C\n- From Parent 2: c and b\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBb) receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. Therefore, F1 has Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes C and B. Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes c and b. So F1 (CcBb) has C (dominant) and B (dominant). Therefore, the F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes:\n\n- Genotype: 25% CC (C from CB + C from CB), 25% Cc (C from CB + c from cb), 25% cc (c from cb + c from cb), 25% bb (b from cb + b from cb)\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Because each parent contributes one allele, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc (same as above, due to segregation)\n- cb + cb = cc (probability 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C is dominant) and Brown (B is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant) and Checkered (b recessive)\n- cc: Plain (c recessive) and Brown (B dominant)\n\nSo the phenotypes are four possible combinations: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Plain, Brown), (Plain, Checkered). Now, what's the ratio?\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red and Brown \u2013 Probability of C (parent 1) and B (parent 1) \u2192 (1/2 * 1) * (1/2 * 1) = 1/4\nWait, no\u2014it's more like the probability for C being present is 1/2 (since F1 is Cc), and B being present is 1/2 (since F1 is Bb). Therefore, the probability for both C and B being present is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nPhenotype 2: Red and Checkered \u2192 C present and b absent \u2192 (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown \u2192 c present and B absent \u2192 (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered \u2192 c present and b absent \u2192 same as above, 1/4\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given, none directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, none match exactly. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes. Another approach: Instead of looking at each trait separately, consider all possible combinations. Wait, another way: Since each bird has two traits, the number of possible phenotypes depends on whether the traits are independent. In this case, they are. So there are 3 possibilities for pigment color (red, checkered, plain) and 3 possibilities for body color (brown, checkered, plain). But wait, in reality, each bird has two separate traits, so the actual phenotypic combinations are four: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Checkered, Brown), (Checkered, Checkered). So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include such a ratio. Wait, did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me try another approach. Each bird has two independent traits, so the number of possible phenotypic classes is 3 x 3 = 9, but some may overlap. However, in this specific case, since the genes are linked in terms of dominance, the phenotypes might not cover all nine possibilities. Hmm, perhaps I should list all possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question doesn't specify any linkage between the genes, so they are assumed to assort independently. Therefore, each combination should occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options provided do not have such a ratio. This suggests that either I made a mistake in interpreting the problem or perhaps the options are simplified.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Red color by dominant B, brown by recessive b. So, for pigment color, the bird can be Red (C) or plain (c). For body color, Brown (B) or checkered (b).\n\nThe F2 generation would involve the combination of these traits. Since each trait is determined by a separate pair of genes, the possible phenotypic combinations are four: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Checkered, Brown), (Checkered, Checkered). Assuming independence, each has a 25% chance.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't reflect this exact scenario. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12. That seems off. Perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the genes aren't completely independent, or perhaps the problem assumes that the order of dominance matters differently.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the phenotype as being determined by the sum of the traits rather than each individually. But that doesn't seem right. Another possibility: Maybe the question counts the number of dominant vs recessive alleles instead of the entire trait. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele in each trait would express that trait fully.\n\nBut no, typically, in genetics, each trait is considered separately unless stated otherwise. So, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options A-F match this exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Body Brown (RRB?)\nNo, wait: Pigment Red (C) and Body Brown (B) \u2192 RRBB\n2. Pigment Red and Body Checkered (RrBb)\n3. Pigment Checkered and Body Brown (rrBB)\n4. Pigment Checkered and Body Checkered (rrbb)\n\nThese are four distinct phenotypes. If each occurs with a 25% probability, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%, but arranged in a different order. Wait, no\u2014option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 parts, but our calculation shows 4 parts each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states that the bird's color is determined by the recessive alleles. But the adihybrid cross involves parents that are homozygous for both traits. So, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me try to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, for pigment color (B and b), and for body color (B and b), each gene determines one trait.\n\nIn an adihybrid cross, the F1 would receive one allele from each parent. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B), and Parent 2 is cc bb (both c and b). Therefore, F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C from Cc + C from Cc)\n- 25% Cc (C from Cc + c from cc)\n- 25% cc (c from cc + c from cc)\n- 25% bb (b from cc + b from cc)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options, I notice that option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which aligns with the 25% each, but ordered differently. But according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question expects us to count the number of dominant versus recessive alleles, treating each trait separately. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the dominance hierarchy differently. For instance, perhaps a bird with at least one dominant allele in each trait would display both traits, but in reality, each trait is independent. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach where the phenotypic ratios are based on the sum of the traits rather than their interaction. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment color and at least one dominant allele in body color, it would display both traits. But under standard Mendelian rules, each trait is independent. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the problem is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene locus, regardless of the others. So for pigment color (B and b):\n\n- If C is present (C_), pigment color is red.\n- If c is present (cc), pigment color is plain.\n\nFor body color (B and b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), body color is brown.\n- If b is present (bb), body color is checkered.\n\nThus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red and brown\n2. C_ and bb: red and checkered\n3. cc and B_: plain and brown\n4. cc and bb: plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs with a 25% chance. Hence, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. \n\nBut since none of the options match this, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me look again. The options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\n\nWait, all the options except J add up to 16. But my analysis suggests the ratio is 1:1:1:1, adding to 4. However, this isn't reflected in the options. Perhaps the original problem intended to consider the number of dominant alleles instead of the entire trait. For example, a bird that has at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in body would display both traits. But under standard Mendelian principles, each trait is independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of dominance, where having even one dominant allele results in the dominant trait. In that case, all four phenotypes would still exist, each with a 25% chance. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, corresponding to the 25% each. But that's a different ordering.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of dominant vs recessive alleles. For pigment color (B and b):\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red. Number of dominant alleles: 1 (at least one).\n- If c is present (cc), plain. Number of dominant alleles: 0.\n\nFor body color (B and b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), brown. Number of dominant alleles: 1.\n- If b is present (bb), checkered. Number of dominant alleles: 0.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios based on the number of dominant alleles could be:\n\n- Both dominant: red and brown \u2192 1+1 = 2\n- Pigment dominant, body recessive: red and checkered \u2192 1+0 = 1\n- Pigment recessive, body dominant: plain and brown \u2192 0+1 = 1\n- Pigment recessive, body recessive: plain and checkered \u2192 0+0 = 0\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so the ratio should be based on the combination of both traits. I'm getting confused now.\n\nPerhaps I'll try another approach. Let me assume that the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the number of dominant alleles in each trait, summed together. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in body would display both traits, contributing to the 'dominant' category. Otherwise, it contributes to the 'recessive' category.\n\nBut without clear instructions, this becomes speculative. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the initial thought that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, corresponding to the 25% each. But according to Mendelian ratios, each should be 25%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the ratio of the number of possible phenotypes, not the probability distribution. In that case, each phenotype is unique, so 4:0:0:0, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the number of possible genotypes, not the probability distribution. For example, in a dihybrid cross, the possible genotypic combinations are 9 (for F2), but the phenotypic combinations are 4. So, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the genotypic ratio. In that case, each of the four phenotypes would occur 9/16 times, but that doesn't match any option either.\n\nI think I've reached the limit of my reasoning. Based on the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, possibly representing the 25% each after some adjustment. Alternatively, the correct ratio isn't among the options, which is odd. I must conclude that perhaps the correct answer is option E, 3:9:1:3, despite the mismatch with my calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C):\n- p = frequency of C alleles = (number of C alleles)/(total alleles)\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB, all alleles are C and B.\nParent 2 is cc bb, all alleles are c and b.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) has 2 C, 2 B, 1 c, and 1 b. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 (CcBb) has:\n- From Parent 1: C and C\n- From Parent 2: c and b\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBb) receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. Therefore, F1 has Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes C and B. Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes c and b. So F1 (CcBb) has C (dominant) and B (dominant). Therefore, the F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes:\n\n- Genotype: 25% CC (C from CB + C from CB), 25% Cc (C from CB + c from cb), 25% cc (c from cb + c from cb), 25% bb (b from cb + b from cb)\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Because each parent contributes one allele, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc (same as above, due to segregation)\n- cb + cb = cc (probability 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C is dominant) and Brown (B is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant) and Checkered (b recessive)\n- cc: Plain (c recessive) and Brown (B dominant)\n\nSo the phenotypes are four possible combinations: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Plain, Brown), (Plain, Checkered). Now, what's the ratio?\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red and Brown \u2013 Probability of C (parent 1) and B (parent 1) \u2192 (1/2 * 1) * (1/2 * 1) = 1/4\nWait, no\u2014it's more like the probability for C being present is 1/2 (since F1 is Cc), and B being present is 1/2 (since F1 is Bb). Therefore, the probability for both C and B being present is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nPhenotype 2: Red and Checkered \u2192 C present and b absent \u2192 (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown \u2192 c present and B absent \u2192 (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered \u2192 c present and b absent \u2192 same as above, 1/4\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given, none directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, none match exactly. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypes. Another approach: Instead of looking at each trait separately, consider all possible combinations. Wait, another way: Since each bird has two traits, the number of possible phenotypes depends on whether the traits are independent. In this case, they are. So there are 3 possibilities for pigment color (red, checkered, plain) and 3 possibilities for body color (brown, checkered, plain). But wait, in reality, each bird has two separate traits, so the actual phenotypic combinations are four: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Checkered, Brown), (Checkered, Checkered). So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include such a ratio. Wait, did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me try another approach. Each bird has two independent traits, so the number of possible phenotypic classes is 3 x 3 = 9, but some may overlap. However, in this specific case, since the genes are linked in terms of dominance, the phenotypes might not cover all nine possibilities. Hmm, perhaps I should list all possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question doesn't specify any linkage between the genes, so they are assumed to assort independently. Therefore, each combination should occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options provided do not have such a ratio. This suggests that either I made a mistake in interpreting the problem or perhaps the options are simplified.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Red color by dominant B, brown by recessive b. So, for pigment color, the bird can be Red (C) or plain (c). For body color, Brown (B) or checkered (b).\n\nThe F2 generation would involve the combination of these traits. Since each trait is determined by a separate pair of genes, the possible phenotypic combinations are four: (Red, Brown), (Red, Checkered), (Checkered, Brown), (Checkered, Checkered). Assuming independence, each has a 25% chance.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't reflect this exact scenario. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12. That seems off. Perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the genes aren't completely independent, or perhaps the problem assumes that the order of dominance matters differently.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the phenotype as being determined by the sum of the traits rather than each individually. But that doesn't seem right. Another possibility: Maybe the question counts the number of dominant vs recessive alleles instead of the entire trait. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele in each trait would express that trait fully.\n\nBut no, typically, in genetics, each trait is considered separately unless stated otherwise. So, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options A-F match this exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Body Brown (RRB?)\nNo, wait: Pigment Red (C) and Body Brown (B) \u2192 RRBB\n2. Pigment Red and Body Checkered (RrBb)\n3. Pigment Checkered and Body Brown (rrBB)\n4. Pigment Checkered and Body Checkered (rrbb)\n\nThese are four distinct phenotypes. If each occurs with a 25% probability, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to 25%, 50%, 25%, 25%, but arranged in a different order. Wait, no\u2014option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 parts, but our calculation shows 4 parts each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states that the bird's color is determined by the recessive alleles. But the adihybrid cross involves parents that are homozygous for both traits. So, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me try to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, for pigment color (B and b), and for body color (B and b), each gene determines one trait.\n\nIn an adihybrid cross, the F1 would receive one allele from each parent. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B), and Parent 2 is cc bb (both c and b). Therefore, F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C from Cc + C from Cc)\n- 25% Cc (C from Cc + c from cc)\n- 25% cc (c from cc + c from cc)\n- 25% bb (b from cc + b from cc)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options, I notice that option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which aligns with the 25% each, but ordered differently. But according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question expects us to count the number of dominant versus recessive alleles, treating each trait separately. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the dominance hierarchy differently. For instance, perhaps a bird with at least one dominant allele in each trait would display both traits, but in reality, each trait is independent. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach where the phenotypic ratios are based on the sum of the traits rather than their interaction. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment color and at least one dominant allele in body color, it would display both traits. But under standard Mendelian rules, each trait is independent. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the problem is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene locus, regardless of the others. So for pigment color (B and b):\n\n- If C is present (C_), pigment color is red.\n- If c is present (cc), pigment color is plain.\n\nFor body color (B and b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), body color is brown.\n- If b is present (bb), body color is checkered.\n\nThus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red and brown\n2. C_ and bb: red and checkered\n3. cc and B_: plain and brown\n4. cc and bb: plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs with a 25% chance. Hence, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. \n\nBut since none of the options match this, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me look again. The options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\n\nWait, all the options except J add up to 16. But my analysis suggests the ratio is 1:1:1:1, adding to 4. However, this isn't reflected in the options. Perhaps the original problem intended to consider the number of dominant alleles instead of the entire trait. For example, a bird that has at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in body would display both traits. But under standard Mendelian principles, each trait is independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of dominance, where having even one dominant allele results in the dominant trait. In that case, all four phenotypes would still exist, each with a 25% chance. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, corresponding to the 25% each. But that's a different ordering.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of dominant vs recessive alleles. For pigment color (B and b):\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red. Number of dominant alleles: 1 (at least one).\n- If c is present (cc), plain. Number of dominant alleles: 0.\n\nFor body color (B and b):\n\n- If B is present (B_), brown. Number of dominant alleles: 1.\n- If b is present (bb), checkered. Number of dominant alleles: 0.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios based on the number of dominant alleles could be:\n\n- Both dominant: red and brown \u2192 1+1 = 2\n- Pigment dominant, body recessive: red and checkered \u2192 1+0 = 1\n- Pigment recessive, body dominant: plain and brown \u2192 0+1 = 1\n- Pigment recessive, body recessive: plain and checkered \u2192 0+0 = 0\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so the ratio should be based on the combination of both traits. I'm getting confused now.\n\nPerhaps I'll try another approach. Let me assume that the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the number of dominant alleles in each trait, summed together. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in body would display both traits, contributing to the 'dominant' category. Otherwise, it contributes to the 'recessive' category.\n\nBut without clear instructions, this becomes speculative. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the initial thought that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, corresponding to the 25% each. But according to Mendelian ratios, each should be 25%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the ratio of the number of possible phenotypes, not the probability distribution. In that case, each phenotype is unique, so 4:0:0:0, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the number of possible genotypes, not the probability distribution. For example, in a dihybrid cross, the possible genotypic combinations are 9 (for F2), but the phenotypic combinations are 4. So, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the genotypic ratio. In that case, each of the four phenotypes would occur 9/16 times, but that doesn't match any option either.\n\nI think I've reached the limit of my reasoning. Based on the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, possibly representing the 25% each after some adjustment. Alternatively, the correct ratio isn't among the options, which is odd. I must conclude that perhaps the correct answer is option E, 3:9:1:3, despite the mismatch with my calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype combination is (p_C * p_B) + (p_C * p_b) + (p_c * p_B) + (p_c * p_b).",
    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype combination is (p_C * p_B) + (p_C * p_b) + (p_c * p_B) + (p_c * p_b). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, for each gene, the probabilities are additive. So the chance that C is present is p_C = frequency of C in the gametes, and similarly for B. Since each gene is recessive, the alleles are always present in the gametes. Wait, but in reality, for each bird, the C and B alleles determine the phenotype. So for pigment color (C), the presence (red) occurs when either C or Cc is present. Similarly, for body color (B), presence (brown) when B or Bb is present. But since each parent contributes only one allele, the overall phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence (C): 100%\n- Absence (c): 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the bird is either C or c. If it's C, it's red; if c, plain. So the probability for pigment color is 100% red if C is present, else plain. For the B locus (body color):\n- Presence (B): 100% brown if B is present, else checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if a bird is Cc, then for pigment color, it's still red because C is dominant. Similarly, if a bird is Bb, it's brown because B is dominant. So the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird inherits two alleles from each parent. Since each parent is Cc and Bb (for F2?), wait, no\u2014the parents themselves are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CC BB (dominant for both genes) and cc bb (recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2, which is what we\u2019re looking at. Now, F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each gene: C (either CC, Cc, or cc) and B (either BB, Bb, or bb). However, considering that the parents are CC BB (so both parents are homozygous) and cc bb (also homozygous), their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the Punnett square where each parent produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (any combination where C is dominant), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (i.e., cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (any combination where B is dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (i.e., bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo now, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, that seems off. Because in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So for example, a bird could be:\n\n- C (present) and B (present): Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- C (present) and B (absent): Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C (absent) and B (present): Plain, Pigment red \u2192 Wait, no, C being absent means plain, regardless of B. Similarly, C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain and checkered.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Pigment: C present \u2192 Red; else \u2192 Plain\n- Body: B present \u2192 Brown; else \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of pigment and body color.\n\nSo for each bird in F2:\n\nPhenotype | Pigment | Body\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Present C | Present B\nCheckered brown | Present C | Absent B\nPlain red | Absent C | Present B\nPlain brown | Absent C | Absent B\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3, 5, 6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9 cases, which makes sense because F2 has 9 birds.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 3 : 1 : 2\n\nWhich simplifies to 3/9 : 3/9 : 1/9 : 2/9 \u2192 1:1:1:2/3. Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. Let me look at the answer choices again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our counts.\n\nB. 8,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 That adds up to 16, which is wrong because F2 is 9 birds.\n\nD. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16.\n\nF. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nL. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nM. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match my calculation of 3:3:1:2. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 Red; c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) \u2192 Brown; b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo a bird is:\n\n- Red if C present\n- Brown if B present\n- Plain if c present\n- Checkered if b present\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Because if a bird is C present and B absent, it's Checkered brown. Similarly, if C absent and B present, it's Plain brown. If both are absent, it's Plain checkered.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each type:\n\nFrom the Punnett square analysis earlier, I had:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n\nTotal: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9 birds.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:2/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. None of them match 3:3:1:2.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nYes, that's 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. So the ratio is 3:3:1:2.\n\nNone of the options A to J match this. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try another approach: calculating the possible phenotypes directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the probabilities using the law of independent assortment.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous (CcBb). Therefore, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nAdding up the Checkered red and Checkered brown:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nSimilarly, Plain red and Plain brown:\n\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWait, that's different from before. Now, according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 25% Plain brown.\n\nThat would mean a phenotypic ratio of 2:2:1:1, but that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the genotypes and phenotypes. Let me consider the actual phenotypic expressions:\n\nEach bird is expressed as follows:\n\n- If C is present, it's Pigment red, regardless of B\n- If C is absent, it's Plain, regardless of B\n\nAnd:\n\n- If B is present, it's Body brown, regardless of C\n- If B is absent, it's Checkered, regardless of C\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, but that would suggest that the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, without considering the interaction between C and B. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele (C or B) will be Pigment red or Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any bird with at least one recessive allele (c or b) will be Plain or Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (either C or B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown (both C and b recessive)\n3. Plain red (only c recessive)\n4. Plain brown (both c and b recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:1:2, which is 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown.\n\nAgain, none of the answer options match this ratio. Let me see the answer options again:\n\nA. 6, 2 \u2192 No\nB. 8, 4 \u2192 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 birds total, which is incorrect\nD. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\nF. 4,4 \u2192 No\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum to 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum to 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nNone of these sum to 9 birds except option C (sum to 16) and others don't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation is 9 birds, then the options must reflect that.\n\nLooking back, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That's 16 birds, which can't be right since F2 should have 9 birds. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which sums to 16. Options A-D sum to less than 9. So perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2? But the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the number of each phenotype:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered red (2)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (3)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (4)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (5)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (6)\n- cc BB: Plain red (7)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (8)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (9)\n\nSo indeed, 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. Total 9.\n\nThis ratio would be 3:3:1:2, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the options are presented differently, like in terms of Phenotypic Expression rather than Phenotypic Ratio. Let me read the options again.\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Sum 16. Not applicable.\n\nOption H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Looking back, the original question lists options A through J, but some of them may have typos.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. The F1 was given as:\n\n- CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfing would produce F2. If the question mistakenly refers to F1 instead of F2, let's recalculate the phenotypic ratio for F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb.\n\nThe F1 phenotypes are determined by the dominant alleles. For pigment color (C), presence (red) vs absence (plain). For body color (B), presence (brown) vs absence (checkered).\n\nF1 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independently assorting, the probability for each phenotype combination is (p_C * p_B) + (p_C * p_b) + (p_c * p_B) + (p_c * p_b). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, for each gene, the probabilities are additive. So the chance that C is present is p_C = frequency of C in the gametes, and similarly for B. Since each gene is recessive, the alleles are always present in the gametes. Wait, but in reality, for each bird, the C and B alleles determine the phenotype. So for pigment color (C), the presence (red) occurs when either C or Cc is present. Similarly, for body color (B), presence (brown) when B or Bb is present. But since each parent contributes only one allele, the overall phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Presence (C): 100%\n- Absence (c): 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the bird is either C or c. If it's C, it's red; if c, plain. So the probability for pigment color is 100% red if C is present, else plain. For the B locus (body color):\n- Presence (B): 100% brown if B is present, else checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if a bird is Cc, then for pigment color, it's still red because C is dominant. Similarly, if a bird is Bb, it's brown because B is dominant. So the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird inherits two alleles from each parent. Since each parent is Cc and Bb (for F2?), wait, no\u2014the parents themselves are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, no\u2014parents are CC BB (dominant for both genes) and cc bb (recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2, which is what we\u2019re looking at. Now, F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each gene: C (either CC, Cc, or cc) and B (either BB, Bb, or bb). However, considering that the parents are CC BB (so both parents are homozygous) and cc bb (also homozygous), their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the Punnett square where each parent produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (any combination where C is dominant), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (i.e., cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (any combination where B is dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (i.e., bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo now, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, that seems off. Because in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So for example, a bird could be:\n\n- C (present) and B (present): Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- C (present) and B (absent): Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C (absent) and B (present): Plain, Pigment red \u2192 Wait, no, C being absent means plain, regardless of B. Similarly, C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain and checkered.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Pigment: C present \u2192 Red; else \u2192 Plain\n- Body: B present \u2192 Brown; else \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of pigment and body color.\n\nSo for each bird in F2:\n\nPhenotype | Pigment | Body\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Present C | Present B\nCheckered brown | Present C | Absent B\nPlain red | Absent C | Present B\nPlain brown | Absent C | Absent B\n\nNow, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb: C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3, 5, 6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain brown: Cases 8, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9 cases, which makes sense because F2 has 9 birds.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 3 : 1 : 2\n\nWhich simplifies to 3/9 : 3/9 : 1/9 : 2/9 \u2192 1:1:1:2/3. Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. Let me look at the answer choices again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our counts.\n\nB. 8,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 That adds up to 16, which is wrong because F2 is 9 birds.\n\nD. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16.\n\nF. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nL. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nM. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match my calculation of 3:3:1:2. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 Red; c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) \u2192 Brown; b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo a bird is:\n\n- Red if C present\n- Brown if B present\n- Plain if c present\n- Checkered if b present\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Because if a bird is C present and B absent, it's Checkered brown. Similarly, if C absent and B present, it's Plain brown. If both are absent, it's Plain checkered.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each type:\n\nFrom the Punnett square analysis earlier, I had:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n\nTotal: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9 birds.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:2/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. None of them match 3:3:1:2.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nYes, that's 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. So the ratio is 3:3:1:2.\n\nNone of the options A to J match this. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try another approach: calculating the possible phenotypes directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the probabilities using the law of independent assortment.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous (CcBb). Therefore, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nAdding up the Checkered red and Checkered brown:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nSimilarly, Plain red and Plain brown:\n\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWait, that's different from before. Now, according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 25% Plain brown.\n\nThat would mean a phenotypic ratio of 2:2:1:1, but that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the genotypes and phenotypes. Let me consider the actual phenotypic expressions:\n\nEach bird is expressed as follows:\n\n- If C is present, it's Pigment red, regardless of B\n- If C is absent, it's Plain, regardless of B\n\nAnd:\n\n- If B is present, it's Body brown, regardless of C\n- If B is absent, it's Checkered, regardless of C\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, but that would suggest that the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, without considering the interaction between C and B. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant allele (C or B) will be Pigment red or Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Any bird with at least one recessive allele (c or b) will be Plain or Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (either C or B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown (both C and b recessive)\n3. Plain red (only c recessive)\n4. Plain brown (both c and b recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:1:2, which is 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown.\n\nAgain, none of the answer options match this ratio. Let me see the answer options again:\n\nA. 6, 2 \u2192 No\nB. 8, 4 \u2192 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 birds total, which is incorrect\nD. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\nF. 4,4 \u2192 No\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum to 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum to 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nNone of these sum to 9 birds except option C (sum to 16) and others don't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If the F2 generation is 9 birds, then the options must reflect that.\n\nLooking back, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That's 16 birds, which can't be right since F2 should have 9 birds. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which sums to 16. Options A-D sum to less than 9. So perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2? But the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the number of each phenotype:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered red (2)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (3)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (4)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (5)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (6)\n- cc BB: Plain red (7)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (8)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (9)\n\nSo indeed, 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. Total 9.\n\nThis ratio would be 3:3:1:2, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the options are presented differently, like in terms of Phenotypic Expression rather than Phenotypic Ratio. Let me read the options again.\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Sum 16. Not applicable.\n\nOption H: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Looking back, the original question lists options A through J, but some of them may have typos.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2. The F1 was given as:\n\n- CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfing would produce F2. If the question mistakenly refers to F1 instead of F2, let's recalculate the phenotypic ratio for F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb.\n\nThe F1 phenotypes are determined by the dominant alleles. For pigment color (C), presence (red) vs absence (plain). For body color (B), presence (brown) vs absence (checkered).\n\nF1 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me approach this differently: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.",
    "rollout": " Let me approach this differently: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in that trait being expressed. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): RR and BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): RR and bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): cc and BB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): cc and bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be found by determining the probabilities of each gene combination. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red (C) is 75%, since C is dominant. Similarly, the probability of having brown body (B) is 75%. The probability of having red-brown (both dominant) is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly, red-checkered is 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nPlain-brown is 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nPlain-checkered is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100% (56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%). So the phenotypic ratios are approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. If we scale these up to a large population, say 100 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 56 red-brown\n- 18 red-checkered\n- 18 plain-brown\n- 6 plain-checkered\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,2,1 \u2192 sum to 11\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum to16\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum to16\n\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192sum to16\n\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192sum to16\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192sum to16\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192sum to16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192sum to12\n\nK.4,4,4,4\u2192same as F)\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16 except option F which sums to 16, but in my calculation, the sum is 16. But the options vary in how they present the numbers. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16. So according to our calculation, the expected phenotypic distribution is roughly 56:18:18:6, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly reflect this exact distribution. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check. The probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C: 0.75\n- c: 0.25\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B: 0.75\n- b: 0.25\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\nRed-brown (C and B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n\nRed-checkered (C and b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n\nPlain-brown (c and B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n\nPlain-checkered (c and b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nSo the ratios are 0.5625 : 0.1875 : 0.1875 : 0.0625\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 0.0625:\n\n0.5625 / 0.0625 = 9\n\n0.1875 / 0.0625 = 3\n\nSame for the others.\n\nSo the simplified ratios are 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (which would be the most common phenotype, as both genes are dominant), followed by checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Summing to 18.\n\nOption H is 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1, sum to 12.\n\nOption K is 4,4,4,4, which matches F.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The options might represent counts instead of percentages. Let me recalculate using actual counts.\n\nAssuming a large number of birds, say 16 birds (the least common denominator), then:\n\nCheckered red (9 parts): 9\n\nCheckered brown (3 parts): 3\n\nPlain red (3 parts): 3\n\nPlain brown (1 part):1\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this. Alternatively, maybe the options are showing the counts without simplifying, like 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to option G. But option G's checkered red is 12, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Let me try scaling up the 9:3:3:1 ratio to match the options. If we take 9 units for checkered red, 3 for checkered brown, 3 for plain red, and 1 for plain brown, that's 16 units. Looking at the options, option F has 4,4,4,4, which is half of that. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking for the exact ratio but rather the expected phenotypic ratio based on the given answer choices. Since I'm getting a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to option G (checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2) doesn't match because 9+3+3+1=16, but option G shows larger numbers adding to 18. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nWait, another way: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Checkered red with brown body.\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Checkered red with plain body.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Plain with brown body.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain with plain body.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red and brown : 3 checkered red and plain : 3 plain red and brown : 1 plain red and plain.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which adds to 18, not matching. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which adds to 16, but the ratio doesn't match. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which also adds to 12. Option K is \"4,4,4,4.\" Option F is \"4,4,4,4\" as well. None of them exactly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the count of each phenotype relative to the total.\n\nIf we consider the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the proportion for checkered red and brown is 9/(9+3+3+1)=9/16\u224856.25%. Similarly, checkered red and plain is 3/16\u224818.75%, plain red and brown is 3/16\u224818.75%, and plain red and plain is 1/16\u22486.25%. \n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly. Maybe the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in a certain context, like after selection. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the parent genotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nF1 would get CB from each parent, making CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nTherefore, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red, body plain \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- cc: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 plain red and brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body plain \u2192 plain red and plain\n\nEach has a 25% chance, leading to 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation in terms of the number of each phenotype type. If we assume a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 16 * (9/16) = 9 checkered red and brown\n- 16 * (3/16) = 3 checkered red and plain\n- 16 * (3/16) = 3 plain red and brown\n- 16 * (1/16) = 1 plain red and plain\n\nThis would mean the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red and brown : 3 checkered red and plain : 3 plain red and brown : 1 plain red and plain.\n\nLooking at the options again, none directly match this ratio except option G, which scales it up to 12, 2, 2, 2, which adds to 18. But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the raw count before normalization, but that wouldn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so both alleles are present, resulting in pigment red and body brown.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both alleles are recessive, resulting in plain body and pigment.\n\nWhen they mate, F1 gets CB from each parent, making CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb.\n\nSo the expected phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red, body plain \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- cc: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 plain red and brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body plain \u2192 plain red and plain\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance in a different manner, such as counting only the dominant phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the dominant phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (from C)\n- Body brown (from B)\n\nSo the dominant phenotypes would be any bird with pigment red or body brown. The recessive phenotypes would be those without pigment red and without body brown, which is the bb case.\n\nThe dominant phenotypes would include:\n\n- All checkered red and brown (since C is dominant regardless of B)\n- All checkered red and plain (since C is dominant, but B is recessive)\n- All plain red and brown (since c is recessive, but B is dominant)\n- Only the plain red and plain case is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nDominant phenotypes are those where either the pigment is red (C) or the body is brown (B). So, any bird with pigment red (C) or brown body (B) will exhibit at least one dominant trait. The only recessive phenotype is the bird with both recessive traits: c and b.\n\nSo, the dominant phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) OR brown body (B)\n- Which includes:\n  - Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n  - Pigment red and plain (C and b)\n  - Plain and brown (c and B)\n  - Plain and plain (c and b)\n\nAnd the recessive is:\n\n- Plain and plain (c and b)\n\nSo, the dominant phenotypes would be all except the plain and plain case. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, including all possible phenotypes, even the recessive ones.\n\nSo, the ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts (as per earlier)\n- Pigment red and plain: 3 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Plain and plain: 1 part\n\nWhich totals 16 parts, with the ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, none directly match this.

Option F is 4,4,4,4, same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It might be asking for the expected phenotypic ratio based on the observed distribution after selection, but the options don't suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of at least one dominant trait, which would exclude the plain and plain case.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me approach this differently: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in that trait being expressed. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): RR and BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): RR and bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): cc and BB \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): cc and bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be found by determining the probabilities of each gene combination. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red (C) is 75%, since C is dominant. Similarly, the probability of having brown body (B) is 75%. The probability of having red-brown (both dominant) is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly, red-checkered is 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nPlain-brown is 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.\n\nPlain-checkered is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100% (56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%). So the phenotypic ratios are approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. If we scale these up to a large population, say 100 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 56 red-brown\n- 18 red-checkered\n- 18 plain-brown\n- 6 plain-checkered\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,2,1 \u2192 sum to 11\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum to16\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum to16\n\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192sum to16\n\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192sum to16\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192sum to16\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192sum to16\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192sum to12\n\nK.4,4,4,4\u2192same as F)\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16 except option F which sums to 16, but in my calculation, the sum is 16. But the options vary in how they present the numbers. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16. So according to our calculation, the expected phenotypic distribution is roughly 56:18:18:6, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly reflect this exact distribution. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check. The probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C: 0.75\n- c: 0.25\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B: 0.75\n- b: 0.25\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\nRed-brown (C and B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n\nRed-checkered (C and b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n\nPlain-brown (c and B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n\nPlain-checkered (c and b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nSo the ratios are 0.5625 : 0.1875 : 0.1875 : 0.0625\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 0.0625:\n\n0.5625 / 0.0625 = 9\n\n0.1875 / 0.0625 = 3\n\nSame for the others.\n\nSo the simplified ratios are 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (which would be the most common phenotype, as both genes are dominant), followed by checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Summing to 18.\n\nOption H is 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1, sum to 12.\n\nOption K is 4,4,4,4, which matches F.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The options might represent counts instead of percentages. Let me recalculate using actual counts.\n\nAssuming a large number of birds, say 16 birds (the least common denominator), then:\n\nCheckered red (9 parts): 9\n\nCheckered brown (3 parts): 3\n\nPlain red (3 parts): 3\n\nPlain brown (1 part):1\n\nTotal: 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this. Alternatively, maybe the options are showing the counts without simplifying, like 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to option G. But option G's checkered red is 12, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Let me try scaling up the 9:3:3:1 ratio to match the options. If we take 9 units for checkered red, 3 for checkered brown, 3 for plain red, and 1 for plain brown, that's 16 units. Looking at the options, option F has 4,4,4,4, which is half of that. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking for the exact ratio but rather the expected phenotypic ratio based on the given answer choices. Since I'm getting a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to option G (checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2) doesn't match because 9+3+3+1=16, but option G shows larger numbers adding to 18. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nWait, another way: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Checkered red with brown body.\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Checkered red with plain body.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Plain with brown body.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain with plain body.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red and brown : 3 checkered red and plain : 3 plain red and brown : 1 plain red and plain.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which adds to 18, not matching. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which adds to 16, but the ratio doesn't match. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which also adds to 12. Option K is \"4,4,4,4.\" Option F is \"4,4,4,4\" as well. None of them exactly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the count of each phenotype relative to the total.\n\nIf we consider the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the proportion for checkered red and brown is 9/(9+3+3+1)=9/16\u224856.25%. Similarly, checkered red and plain is 3/16\u224818.75%, plain red and brown is 3/16\u224818.75%, and plain red and plain is 1/16\u22486.25%. \n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly. Maybe the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in a certain context, like after selection. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the parent genotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nF1 would get CB from each parent, making CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nTherefore, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red, body plain \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- cc: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 plain red and brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body plain \u2192 plain red and plain\n\nEach has a 25% chance, leading to 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation in terms of the number of each phenotype type. If we assume a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 16 * (9/16) = 9 checkered red and brown\n- 16 * (3/16) = 3 checkered red and plain\n- 16 * (3/16) = 3 plain red and brown\n- 16 * (1/16) = 1 plain red and plain\n\nThis would mean the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red and brown : 3 checkered red and plain : 3 plain red and brown : 1 plain red and plain.\n\nLooking at the options again, none directly match this ratio except option G, which scales it up to 12, 2, 2, 2, which adds to 18. But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the raw count before normalization, but that wouldn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so both alleles are present, resulting in pigment red and body brown.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both alleles are recessive, resulting in plain body and pigment.\n\nWhen they mate, F1 gets CB from each parent, making CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb.\n\nSo the expected phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Cc: Pigment red, body plain \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- cc: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 plain red and brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body plain \u2192 plain red and plain\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression based on dominance in a different manner, such as counting only the dominant phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the dominant phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (from C)\n- Body brown (from B)\n\nSo the dominant phenotypes would be any bird with pigment red or body brown. The recessive phenotypes would be those without pigment red and without body brown, which is the bb case.\n\nThe dominant phenotypes would include:\n\n- All checkered red and brown (since C is dominant regardless of B)\n- All checkered red and plain (since C is dominant, but B is recessive)\n- All plain red and brown (since c is recessive, but B is dominant)\n- Only the plain red and plain case is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nDominant phenotypes are those where either the pigment is red (C) or the body is brown (B). So, any bird with pigment red (C) or brown body (B) will exhibit at least one dominant trait. The only recessive phenotype is the bird with both recessive traits: c and b.\n\nSo, the dominant phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) OR brown body (B)\n- Which includes:\n  - Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n  - Pigment red and plain (C and b)\n  - Plain and brown (c and B)\n  - Plain and plain (c and b)\n\nAnd the recessive is:\n\n- Plain and plain (c and b)\n\nSo, the dominant phenotypes would be all except the plain and plain case. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, including all possible phenotypes, even the recessive ones.\n\nSo, the ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts (as per earlier)\n- Pigment red and plain: 3 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Plain and plain: 1 part\n\nWhich totals 16 parts, with the ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, none directly match this. Option G has 12,2,2,2 which doesn't align. Option H is 5,3,2,6 which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which doesn't match. Option K is 4,4,4,4, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, same issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It might be asking for the expected phenotypic ratio based on the observed distribution after selection, but the options don't suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of at least one dominant trait, which would exclude the plain and plain case. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3, excluding the 1 part. But the options don't reflect this either.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is using a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratio, such as considering only the presence of the dominant alleles without accounting for dominance. For example, treating each gene separately, ignoring dominance, which would lead to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Because the sum is 16, which could come from 5+3+2+6=16. But why would checkered red be 5?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the probabilities correctly. The correct probabilities are:\n\n- C (pigment red): 75%\n- B (body brown): 75%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability of having at least one dominant trait is 1 minus the probability of both recessive:\n\n1 - (0.25 * 0.25) = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375, which is 93.75%. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the presence of at least one dominant allele, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but scaled to 16 parts, giving 9,3,3,1. However, the options don't have this. The closest option is option G, which scales it higher than needed.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Given the options, none of them perfectly match this. However, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which adds up to 16. This suggests that the question may be expecting a different approach, possibly considering the number of each phenotype in a specific context, like after some sort of selection or different assumptions about dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to each other, not their absolute counts. But without knowing the exact scenario, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Now, back to the problem: the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each genotype leading to those phenotypes.",
    "rollout": " Now, back to the problem: the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each genotype leading to those phenotypes.\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Let me see what the user provided. They gave several options, some with specific ratios like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" and others with 4,4,4,4. To calculate the exact ratio, I'll consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probability of each genotype leading to that phenotype. Since the parents are producing gametes with equal likelihood for each allele (assuming complete dominance and independent assortment), the F2 population will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each combination is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that's only if each gene is segregating independently. In reality, each bird's phenotype combines both traits, so the actual number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated by adding the appropriate counts from the Punnett squares.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the expected ratio can be calculated by determining how many combinations lead to each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Plain red \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, but that might not account for the fact that some phenotypes may overlap in terms of their underlying genetic makeup. However, since each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, and each trait is determined independently, the overall phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often. \n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to indicate a 1:1:1:1 ratio except option G which says 12,1,3,1, summing to 17, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The user included multiple options, including A through H, each giving a different ratio. Let me look again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which seems plausible. Alternatively, another option could be D where checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, totaling 16. Another possibility is G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, totaling 16.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Maybe I should construct the Punnett square properly. Let me try that.\n\nThe parent 1 is CC BB, and parent 2 is cc bb. Their F1 is Cc BB? No, wait, parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), bb (25%)?\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of gametes. Each F1 bird (CcBb) produces either CB or cb gametes. So F2 can be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc (25%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc (25%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles C and B:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Checkered red: 25% (from CC)\n2. Plain red: 50% (from Cc)\n3. Checkered brown: 25% (from cc)\n4. Plain brown: 25% (from cc)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2 when ordered by phenotype type. But looking at the answer options, none directly reflect this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds. If the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, then according to the probabilities:\n\n- 25% checkered red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n\nThat totals 16 birds, but none of the options match exactly. Looking at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation will have four possible genotypes, each contributing to the phenotype. Each genotype contributes to the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype in F2 is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nThis sums to 16 birds, but none of the options match this exactly. However, let's look at the options again:\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. This doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Again, not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me recount the contributions:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits. The F2 generation will have 16 birds. According to our calculations, 25% should have each phenotype. So:\n\n- 25% checkered red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n\nHowever, none of the options match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check the Punnett square approach.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (produces CB gametes)\nParent 2: cc bb (produces cb gametes)\nF1: CcBb (produces CB and cb gametes)\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\nFrom CB x CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), bb (25%)\nFrom CB x cb \u2192 Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nFrom cb x CB \u2192 Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nFrom cb x cb \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nCombining all:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB x CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB x cb and cb x CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb x cb)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nPhenotypic ratio based on genotype frequency:\n\nCheckered red: 25%\nPlain red: 50%\nCheckered brown: 25%\nPlain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:2:1:2. But looking at the answer options, none of them represent this exactly. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the order, just their quantities.\n\nIf we assume the F2 generation has 16 birds (since 2^4 = 16), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds\n\nNone of these match our expectation of 4 each. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on the Mendelian ratios, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1:2, which is equivalent to 4:8:4:4 if normalized to 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the user's options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\nG.12,2,2,0\u219216\nH.5,3,2,6\u219216\n\nWait, none of these options seem to fit the 1:2:1:2 ratio unless there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 instead of the F2, but the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of each phenotype. Let's recalculate based on the actual numbers of each genotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Checkered brown?\n\nWait, no, if the genotype is cc, regardless of the color, it's Checkered brown. Similarly, if the genotype is Cc, it's plain red. If it's CC, it's checkered red. And if it's cc, it's checkered brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n\nEach of these corresponds to a distinct phenotype. Now, considering the F2 generation, which has:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 50% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n\nSo, assuming a large enough population, the ratio should be approximately 1:2:1, but since there are two traits, it's 1:2:1:2.\n\nBut the options don't include this. Instead, perhaps the user wants the number of each phenotype counted separately, not their ratio. Let's assume that each bird in the F2 generation is represented, and we count the number of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds:\n\n- 4 Checkered red\n- 8 Plain red\n- 4 Checkered brown\n- 4 Plain brown\n\nBut since none of the options match this, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the option that reflects the correct dominance ratios. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, another thought: the checkered bird is recessive (cc) and brown is dominant (B). So, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nAdding up to 16 birds.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option G: 12,2,2,0. Which doesn't align. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 birds, which matches our 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that's a different pattern than our previous 1:2:1:2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The user wrote: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That sums to 16 birds, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That doesn't fit our expected 1:2:1:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the actual F2 genotype frequencies. Let me create a Punnett square for F2:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\nParent 2: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nF2: CC \u00d7 cc and Cc \u00d7 Cc and cc \u00d7 cc\n\nWait, perhaps constructing the Punnett square correctly would help. The F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n2. Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc and cc \u00d7 CC)\n3. cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nAnd the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n\nAssuming each genotype occurs with the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, but since there are two traits, the ratio becomes 1:2:1:2 when considering both traits.\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, if we ignore the second trait and only consider the first, then the ratio would be 1:2:1, but again, the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, but among the given options, option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds, which suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical of a binomial distribution. But that would imply that the traits are additive, which they aren't in this case. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the F2 ratio with the F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 ratio, but the question refers to F2. Let me check the user's question again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, now I realize that the user might be referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the F2. Because the question says \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the F1 is being considered.\n\nWait, but the question also mentions \"for this cross, show the expected",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Now, back to the problem: the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each genotype leading to those phenotypes.\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Let me see what the user provided. They gave several options, some with specific ratios like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" and others with 4,4,4,4. To calculate the exact ratio, I'll consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probability of each genotype leading to that phenotype. Since the parents are producing gametes with equal likelihood for each allele (assuming complete dominance and independent assortment), the F2 population will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each combination is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that's only if each gene is segregating independently. In reality, each bird's phenotype combines both traits, so the actual number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated by adding the appropriate counts from the Punnett squares.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the expected ratio can be calculated by determining how many combinations lead to each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Plain red \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Checkered brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (Probability C) * (Probability B) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, but that might not account for the fact that some phenotypes may overlap in terms of their underlying genetic makeup. However, since each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, and each trait is determined independently, the overall phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often. \n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to indicate a 1:1:1:1 ratio except option G which says 12,1,3,1, summing to 17, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The user included multiple options, including A through H, each giving a different ratio. Let me look again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which seems plausible. Alternatively, another option could be D where checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, totaling 16. Another possibility is G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, totaling 16.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Maybe I should construct the Punnett square properly. Let me try that.\n\nThe parent 1 is CC BB, and parent 2 is cc bb. Their F1 is Cc BB? No, wait, parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), bb (25%)?\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of gametes. Each F1 bird (CcBb) produces either CB or cb gametes. So F2 can be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc (25%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc (25%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles C and B:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Checkered red: 25% (from CC)\n2. Plain red: 50% (from Cc)\n3. Checkered brown: 25% (from cc)\n4. Plain brown: 25% (from cc)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2 when ordered by phenotype type. But looking at the answer options, none directly reflect this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds. If the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, then according to the probabilities:\n\n- 25% checkered red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n\nThat totals 16 birds, but none of the options match exactly. Looking at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation will have four possible genotypes, each contributing to the phenotype. Each genotype contributes to the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype in F2 is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nThis sums to 16 birds, but none of the options match this exactly. However, let's look at the options again:\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. This doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 16. Again, not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me recount the contributions:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits. The F2 generation will have 16 birds. According to our calculations, 25% should have each phenotype. So:\n\n- 25% checkered red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain red \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% checkered brown \u2192 4 birds\n- 25% plain brown \u2192 4 birds\n\nHowever, none of the options match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check the Punnett square approach.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (produces CB gametes)\nParent 2: cc bb (produces cb gametes)\nF1: CcBb (produces CB and cb gametes)\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\nFrom CB x CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), bb (25%)\nFrom CB x cb \u2192 Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nFrom cb x CB \u2192 Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nFrom cb x cb \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nCombining all:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB x CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB x cb and cb x CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb x cb)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nPhenotypic ratio based on genotype frequency:\n\nCheckered red: 25%\nPlain red: 50%\nCheckered brown: 25%\nPlain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:2:1:2. But looking at the answer options, none of them represent this exactly. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the order, just their quantities.\n\nIf we assume the F2 generation has 16 birds (since 2^4 = 16), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds\n\nNone of these match our expectation of 4 each. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on the Mendelian ratios, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1:2, which is equivalent to 4:8:4:4 if normalized to 16 birds.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the user's options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\nG.12,2,2,0\u219216\nH.5,3,2,6\u219216\n\nWait, none of these options seem to fit the 1:2:1:2 ratio unless there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 instead of the F2, but the question clearly states F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of each phenotype. Let's recalculate based on the actual numbers of each genotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Checkered brown?\n\nWait, no, if the genotype is cc, regardless of the color, it's Checkered brown. Similarly, if the genotype is Cc, it's plain red. If it's CC, it's checkered red. And if it's cc, it's checkered brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n\nEach of these corresponds to a distinct phenotype. Now, considering the F2 generation, which has:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 50% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Checkered brown)\n\nSo, assuming a large enough population, the ratio should be approximately 1:2:1, but since there are two traits, it's 1:2:1:2.\n\nBut the options don't include this. Instead, perhaps the user wants the number of each phenotype counted separately, not their ratio. Let's assume that each bird in the F2 generation is represented, and we count the number of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that F2 has 16 birds:\n\n- 4 Checkered red\n- 8 Plain red\n- 4 Checkered brown\n- 4 Plain brown\n\nBut since none of the options match this, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the option that reflects the correct dominance ratios. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, another thought: the checkered bird is recessive (cc) and brown is dominant (B). So, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nAdding up to 16 birds.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option G: 12,2,2,0. Which doesn't align. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 birds, which matches our 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that's a different pattern than our previous 1:2:1:2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The user wrote: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That sums to 16 birds, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That doesn't fit our expected 1:2:1:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the actual F2 genotype frequencies. Let me create a Punnett square for F2:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\nParent 2: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nF2: CC \u00d7 cc and Cc \u00d7 Cc and cc \u00d7 cc\n\nWait, perhaps constructing the Punnett square correctly would help. The F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CC \u00d7 CC)\n2. Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc and cc \u00d7 CC)\n3. cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nAnd the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n\nAssuming each genotype occurs with the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, but since there are two traits, the ratio becomes 1:2:1:2 when considering both traits.\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, if we ignore the second trait and only consider the first, then the ratio would be 1:2:1, but again, the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, but among the given options, option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds, which suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical of a binomial distribution. But that would imply that the traits are additive, which they aren't in this case. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the F2 ratio with the F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 ratio, but the question refers to F2. Let me check the user's question again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, now I realize that the user might be referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the F2. Because the question says \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the F1 is being considered.\n\nWait, but the question also mentions \"for this cross, show the expected",

    "chunk_removed": "Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes, but since each bird has two independent traits, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.",
    "rollout": " Each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes, but since each bird has two independent traits, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but given that the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by finding the probability of each combination. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red (since c is plain, but with B being brown)\nWait, no\u2014I think I might have mixed up. Let me clarify: If a bird has both C and B dominant, it's red pigment and brown body. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it's red pigment and checkered body. Similarly, if it has c and B dominant, it's plain and brown, and c and B recessive is plain and checkered. So the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (_C_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (__bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each category depends on the segregation of each gene. Assuming independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, the probability of having C or c is 50% each. For the B locus, same. So the combined probability is (0.5 * 0.5) = 25% for each phenotype category. Therefore, all four phenotypes are equally likely, each at 25%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match that exactly. The options given are A through H, each listing specific ratios. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, checkered is the recessive phenotype, plain is dominant. So, the presence of the dominant allele C results in red color, while c results in plain. Similarly, for B: presence of dominant B results in brown, recessive b results in checkered.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. To determine the phenotype, both genes must be considered. So, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four combinations has a 25% chance, assuming independent assortment. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each category. But looking at the options provided, none directly reflect this. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted something else. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the ratio in the F2 generation after considering dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question clearly asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Given that, each phenotype is equally likely at 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But checking the options:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit my earlier reasoning. Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3, which sums to 16. Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3, summing to 16. Option J: 2, 6, 3, 1, summing to 12. Option F: 4,4,4,4, which is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16. Option B: 8,4,8,4 \u2192 24. Option C: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16.\n\nHmm, none of these have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic expression rather than the actual counts. Wait, another approach: perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing F2 as I thought. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen they produce F1, they should all be CcBb, right? Because each parent can only contribute CB or cb gametes. So F1 is all CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. As I thought before, F2 would have four types of phenotypes: CcBb gametes are CB and cb, each occurring 50% of the time. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four categories. However, looking at the options provided, none of them have this exact ratio. The closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, each phenotype would still be equally likely at 25%, unless there's some interaction between the genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of phenotypes excluding the recessive ones. But that wouldn't make sense either. Wait, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. This seems like a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which could be from a trihybrid cross, but our scenario is a dihybrid cross with recessive and dominant alleles. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation without considering dominance. Let me see how many of each genotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined distribution is 25% for each of the four combinations. So, the number of each F2 bird would be:\n\n- Number of CC: 25% of total\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThus, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) and Cc (50%), so 75% \u2192 75/100\n- Checkered brown: cc (25%) and cB (but wait, in our case, does the F2 have cB or cb? Let me double-check the gametes.)\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the birds can have different genotypes based on the F1's gametes. The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. So, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Cc: Checkered red (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Checkered brown (c dominant, B recessive)\n- bb: Checkered brown (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because B is the coat color. So, for the phenotypes, it's:\n\n- Checkered red: if both C and B are recessive? Wait, no. Wait, the dominant alleles lead to the corresponding trait. So, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment color is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then body color is brown.\n- Otherwise, both are absent (c and b), resulting in plain color and checkered pattern.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and bb): Checkered red\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_): Checkered brown\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb): Checkered brown\n\nSo each of the four phenotypes occurs at 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Wait, let me look again.\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is less than 16 possible (since there are four phenotypes, each appearing once every four birds). So perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the count of each phenotype based on the number of F2 individuals, not the percentage. Since the F2 population would have 100% contribution from the parents' gametes, but the actual numbers depend on the genetic makeup.\n\nWait, another approach: Each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 birds, who themselves are CcBb. So, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the F2 population will have:\n\nFor each combination of C and B:\n\n- C_B_: 25% CC x BB = 25%\n- C_bb: 25% CC x bb = 25%\n- cc_B_: 25% cc x BB = 25%\n- cc_bb: 25% cc x bb = 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in a larger sample, say 16 birds. In that case, each phenotype would appear 4 times, leading to a ratio of 4:4:4:4, but that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider the actual possible phenotypes and their frequencies. Each bird can be classified into four categories based on their genotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red (assuming dominant C and B)\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAssuming independence, each category occurs at 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. Looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. But perhaps the question is considering dominance in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the question.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The question is about the F2 generation, and the options provide specific ratios. Let me try to compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. \n\nIn F2, each bird is a combination of two F1 birds, each of whom is CcBb. The possible combinations are:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ B_): Probability = 25% (for C_) * 25% (for B_) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ bb): Probability = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. Plain red (cc B_): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain brown (cc bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%, which makes sense because 100% - 25% (non-red) - 25% (non-brown) = 50%, but that's not applicable here.\n\nHowever, this calculation gives each phenotype as approximately 6.25% of the population, which doesn't align with any of the options. Therefore, I suspect that the problem may involve a different approach, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's possible combinations.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total number of birds. Let's assume a hypothetical population where all F2 birds are present, and calculate the count for each phenotype.\n\nFrom the above probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: ~6.25%\n- Checkered brown: ~6.25%\n- Plain red: ~6.25%\n- Plain brown: ~6.25%\n\nIf we take 100 birds, approximately 6.25 of each phenotype. However, none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the options represent the ratios without considering dominance, treating each phenotype as equally likely. For example, if each bird is considered to have a 25% chance of being in each phenotype category, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds to 16 birds. If each phenotype occurred 4 times (16 / 4 = 4), then the ratio would be 4:4:4:4. But that doesn't match the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird is a diploid individual with two copies of each gene, and thus the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. In this case, each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes remain the same as before. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. The closest is option G, but it doesn't align with the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: the problem is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross between two parents, each producing a certain number of offspring. Let me recalculate the F2 ratio properly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb) parent, the F1 would be all CcBb. F1 selfing yields F2 with the following genotype distribution:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n- BB: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Bb: Pigment brown, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC, Cc, BB \u2192 75%\n2. Checkered brown: cc, Bb, bb \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75:25, simplifying to 3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option G is 12,4,4,4, which sums to 24. Option E seems to suggest a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would apply to a trihybrid cross with dominant and recessive markers. Here, though, it's a dihybrid cross with recessive and dominant traits. So perhaps the question is incorrectly applying a trihybrid cross concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of each phenotype over the total population, considering the number of each genotype. Let's see:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25% of the population\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe total population is divided into four phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red: (25% CC) + (25% Cc) + (25% BB) = 75%\n2. Checkered brown: (25% cc) + (50% Bb) + (25% bb) = 100% minus 75% \u2192 25%\n\nSo, the ratio is 75:25, or 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes, but since each bird has two independent traits, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but given that the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by finding the probability of each combination. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red (since c is plain, but with B being brown)\nWait, no\u2014I think I might have mixed up. Let me clarify: If a bird has both C and B dominant, it's red pigment and brown body. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it's red pigment and checkered body. Similarly, if it has c and B dominant, it's plain and brown, and c and B recessive is plain and checkered. So the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (_C_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (__bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each category depends on the segregation of each gene. Assuming independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, the probability of having C or c is 50% each. For the B locus, same. So the combined probability is (0.5 * 0.5) = 25% for each phenotype category. Therefore, all four phenotypes are equally likely, each at 25%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match that exactly. The options given are A through H, each listing specific ratios. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, checkered is the recessive phenotype, plain is dominant. So, the presence of the dominant allele C results in red color, while c results in plain. Similarly, for B: presence of dominant B results in brown, recessive b results in checkered.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. To determine the phenotype, both genes must be considered. So, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four combinations has a 25% chance, assuming independent assortment. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each category. But looking at the options provided, none directly reflect this. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted something else. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the ratio in the F2 generation after considering dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question clearly asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Given that, each phenotype is equally likely at 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But checking the options:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit my earlier reasoning. Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3, which sums to 16. Option E: 3, 9, 1, 3, summing to 16. Option J: 2, 6, 3, 1, summing to 12. Option F: 4,4,4,4, which is 16. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16. Option B: 8,4,8,4 \u2192 24. Option C: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16.\n\nHmm, none of these have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic expression rather than the actual counts. Wait, another approach: perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't producing F2 as I thought. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nWait, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen they produce F1, they should all be CcBb, right? Because each parent can only contribute CB or cb gametes. So F1 is all CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. As I thought before, F2 would have four types of phenotypes: CcBb gametes are CB and cb, each occurring 50% of the time. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four categories. However, looking at the options provided, none of them have this exact ratio. The closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, each phenotype would still be equally likely at 25%, unless there's some interaction between the genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of phenotypes excluding the recessive ones. But that wouldn't make sense either. Wait, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. This seems like a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which could be from a trihybrid cross, but our scenario is a dihybrid cross with recessive and dominant alleles. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation without considering dominance. Let me see how many of each genotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined distribution is 25% for each of the four combinations. So, the number of each F2 bird would be:\n\n- Number of CC: 25% of total\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThus, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) and Cc (50%), so 75% \u2192 75/100\n- Checkered brown: cc (25%) and cB (but wait, in our case, does the F2 have cB or cb? Let me double-check the gametes.)\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the birds can have different genotypes based on the F1's gametes. The F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. So, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Cc: Checkered red (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Checkered brown (c dominant, B recessive)\n- bb: Checkered brown (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because B is the coat color. So, for the phenotypes, it's:\n\n- Checkered red: if both C and B are recessive? Wait, no. Wait, the dominant alleles lead to the corresponding trait. So, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment color is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then body color is brown.\n- Otherwise, both are absent (c and b), resulting in plain color and checkered pattern.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and bb): Checkered red\n3. Plain and brown (cc and B_): Checkered brown\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb): Checkered brown\n\nSo each of the four phenotypes occurs at 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Wait, let me look again.\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is less than 16 possible (since there are four phenotypes, each appearing once every four birds). So perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the count of each phenotype based on the number of F2 individuals, not the percentage. Since the F2 population would have 100% contribution from the parents' gametes, but the actual numbers depend on the genetic makeup.\n\nWait, another approach: Each F2 bird is a combination of two F1 birds, who themselves are CcBb. So, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the F2 population will have:\n\nFor each combination of C and B:\n\n- C_B_: 25% CC x BB = 25%\n- C_bb: 25% CC x bb = 25%\n- cc_B_: 25% cc x BB = 25%\n- cc_bb: 25% cc x bb = 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in a larger sample, say 16 birds. In that case, each phenotype would appear 4 times, leading to a ratio of 4:4:4:4, but that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider the actual possible phenotypes and their frequencies. Each bird can be classified into four categories based on their genotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red (assuming dominant C and B)\n2. C_bb: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc_bb: Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAssuming independence, each category occurs at 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. Looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. But perhaps the question is considering dominance in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the question.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: The question is about the F2 generation, and the options provide specific ratios.

The possible combinations are:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ B_): Probability = 25% (for C_) * 25% (for B_) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown (C_ bb): Probability = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. Plain red (cc B_): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain brown (cc bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%, which makes sense because 100% - 25% (non-red) - 25% (non-brown) = 50%, but that's not applicable here.\n\nHowever, this calculation gives each phenotype as approximately 6.25% of the population, which doesn't align with any of the options. Therefore, I suspect that the problem may involve a different approach, such as counting the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's possible combinations.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total number of birds. Let's assume a hypothetical population where all F2 birds are present, and calculate the count for each phenotype.\n\nFrom the above probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: ~6.25%\n- Checkered brown: ~6.25%\n- Plain red: ~6.25%\n- Plain brown: ~6.25%\n\nIf we take 100 birds, approximately 6.25 of each phenotype. However, none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the options represent the ratios without considering dominance, treating each phenotype as equally likely. For example, if each bird is considered to have a 25% chance of being in each phenotype category, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds to 16 birds. If each phenotype occurred 4 times (16 / 4 = 4), then the ratio would be 4:4:4:4. But that doesn't match the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird is a diploid individual with two copies of each gene, and thus the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. In this case, each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes remain the same as before. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. The closest is option G, but it doesn't align with the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: the problem is considering the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross between two parents, each producing a certain number of offspring. Let me recalculate the F2 ratio properly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb) parent, the F1 would be all CcBb. F1 selfing yields F2 with the following genotype distribution:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red, body black \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n- BB: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Bb: Pigment brown, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, body black \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC, Cc, BB \u2192 75%\n2. Checkered brown: cc, Bb, bb \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75:25, simplifying to 3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Option G is 12,4,4,4, which sums to 24. Option E seems to suggest a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would apply to a trihybrid cross with dominant and recessive markers. Here, though, it's a dihybrid cross with recessive and dominant traits. So perhaps the question is incorrectly applying a trihybrid cross concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of each phenotype over the total population, considering the number of each genotype. Let's see:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25% of the population\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe total population is divided into four phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red: (25% CC) + (25% Cc) + (25% BB) = 75%\n2. Checkered brown: (25% cc) + (50% Bb) + (25% bb) = 100% minus 75% \u2192 25%\n\nSo, the ratio is 75:25, or 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Now, given that the F2 is produced from F1 (CcBb) selfing, each gene follows Mendelian inheritance.",
    "rollout": " Now, given that the F2 is produced from F1 (CcBb) selfing, each gene follows Mendelian inheritance. Each gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Now, let's list all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four combinations above. However, looking back at the options, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios. Option D states: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That corresponds to our calculation where:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn our calculation, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red, Checkered: 3/16\n3. Plain, Brown: 3/16\n4. Plain, Checkered: 1/16\n\nSo the actual phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but in terms of the options given, none directly state this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 This seems to represent the reverse order. In our case, the first category is Pigment red and Brown (which would include checkered birds), then Pigment red and Checkered, followed by Plain red and Brown, then Plain red and Checkered. However, the way the options are presented may vary. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, regardless of how they combine. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the counts for each phenotype would be proportional to the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly. Let me see option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2014 this might mean that:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts (only brown)\n- Plain red: 9 parts (only plain)\n- Plain brown: 3 parts (both plain and brown)\n\nThis doesn't align with my previous conclusion. Perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, let me clarify: Pigment red implies the presence of dominant C allele. Similarly, Brown implies presence of dominant B. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain and Brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive\n\nThe counts are indeed 9:3:3:1. However, the options seem to group them differently. Option D lists:\n\n- Checkered red 1\n- Checkered brown 3\n- Plain red 9\n- Plain brown 3\n\nWhich could imply that:\n\n- Checkered birds have either red or brown fur, depending on the B allele.\nWait, no\u2014it's about the phenotype, not the genotype. So a bird is classified as checkered if it has the recessive c allele (plain) and the dominant B allele (brown). If it has the recessive c and the recessive b alleles, it's plain red. Pigment red comes from having the dominant C allele but the recessive c allele (so it's plain, but the pigment is due to C). Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Actually, a bird is classified as:\n\n- Checkered if it has the recessive c (so plain) and dominant B (brown)\n- Plain if it has recessive c and recessive b (so plain, even though it has B alleles)\n- Pigment red if it has dominant C and any B (but wait, no\u2014if it's recessive c, it's plain, but if it has dominant C and dominant B, it's red. If it has dominant C and recessive B, it's red. If it has recessive c and dominant B, it's brown. If it has recessive c and recessive B, it's plain.)\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (Red/Brown):\n  - Red: C (dominant) is present\n  - Brown: B (dominant) is present\n\n- Body color (Checkered/Plain):\n  - Checkered: recessive c (plain) is present\n  - Plain: recessive c and b (no pigment)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant C and dominant B leads to red and brown respectively. The presence of recessive c (plain) and dominant B leads to brown. The presence of recessive c and recessive b leads to plain. The presence of recessive c (plain) and recessive b (even though B is present) also leads to plain.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nThe frequency for each is:\n\n- 9/16 for C and B\n- 3/16 for C and b\n- 3/16 for c and B\n- 1/16 for c and b\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nBut the options don't match this exactly. Looking at option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2014 this seems to indicate:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts (only brown)\n- Plain red: 9 parts (only plain)\n- Plain brown: 3 parts (both plain and brown)\n\nWait, this doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Perhaps the options are grouping the phenotypes incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the options use different terminology. Let me read the options again:\n\nLooking back, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nIf we interpret this as:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 9 parts\n- Plain brown: 3 parts\n\nThis adds up to 1+3+9+3=16 parts, which matches the denominator of 16. So according to this, the ratio is 1:3:9:3. Which corresponds to the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7... Wait, no, the 1:3:9:3 ratio isn't standard. Normally, the 9:3:3:1 ratio is used, but this is a different grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance. For example:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nSo, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Option D has 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3, but in reverse. Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. For instance, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014so perhaps:\n\n- Number of Checkered red birds: 1\n- Number of Checkered brown birds: 3\n- Number of Plain red birds: 9\n- Number of Plain brown birds: 3\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, which makes sense. So the ratio is 1:3:9:3. This would correspond to the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, it's the sum of the squares of the coefficients in the expansion of (C + b)^2*(B + b)^2. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is that each phenotype is represented by the number of individuals in each category. So, in the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- 9 Checkered red (Pigment red and Brown)\n- 3 Checkered brown (Pigment red and Checkered)\n- 3 Plain red (Plain and Brown)\n- 1 Plain brown (Plain and Checkered)\n\nBut the options don't specify which phenotype is which; instead, they provide the count of each phenotype type. So, for example, if the correct answer is 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown, then option D correctly reflects that with \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" being the inverse of what's needed. Wait, no\u2014it's not the inverse. Because according to our analysis, the Checkered red should be 3, not 1, unless I'm making a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider:\n\n- Pigment red indicates the presence of dominant C.\n- Brown indicates the presence of dominant B.\n\nSo, a bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant (9/16)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive (3/16)\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B dominant (3/16)\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive (1/16)\n\nSo, the counts are indeed 9, 3, 3, 1. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly reflect this except possibly option D if it's reversed, but option D says Checkered red 1, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the question asks for the phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross involves two genes, so the F2 generation would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options suggest different groupings. Option D seems to group Checkered red with plain red, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype in the order Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, which would correspond to 3:1:9:3, which is not correct. Wait, no\u2014the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but among the choices, option D groups the numbers in a certain way that might be considered correct if interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of birds with specific characteristics rather than the overall F2 population. For instance, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, and Plain brown birds in the F2 generation. In that case, the correct counts are 9, 3, 3, 1, which would correspond to the Checkered red (9), Checkered brown (3), Plain red (3), and Plain brown (1). But none of the options match this exactly. Option D says Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. From the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options do not directly reflect this. Option D groups the numbers differently, but perhaps the intended answer is D because it lists the phenotypes in a particular order, despite the numerical discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which sums to 16 and fits the 16 bird count. But in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but option D is the closest, albeit inverted.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of dominance, not the actual count. For example, in the F2 generation, the number of Checkered red birds would be higher because they require both recessive alleles (c and b), whereas others require only one. But that's not how phenotypic ratios work\u2014they are based on the combination of alleles, not just dominance.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is option D, even though the numerical values don't exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. It's possible that the question uses a simplified approach or there's a typo in the options. Therefore, I'll choose option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Now, given that the F2 is produced from F1 (CcBb) selfing, each gene follows Mendelian inheritance. Each gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Now, let's list all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four combinations above. However, looking back at the options, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios. Option D states: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That corresponds to our calculation where:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn our calculation, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red, Checkered: 3/16\n3. Plain, Brown: 3/16\n4. Plain, Checkered: 1/16\n\nSo the actual phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, but in terms of the options given, none directly state this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 This seems to represent the reverse order. In our case, the first category is Pigment red and Brown (which would include checkered birds), then Pigment red and Checkered, followed by Plain red and Brown, then Plain red and Checkered. However, the way the options are presented may vary. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, regardless of how they combine. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the counts for each phenotype would be proportional to the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly. Let me see option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2014 this might mean that:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts (only brown)\n- Plain red: 9 parts (only plain)\n- Plain brown: 3 parts (both plain and brown)\n\nThis doesn't align with my previous conclusion. Perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, let me clarify: Pigment red implies the presence of dominant C allele. Similarly, Brown implies presence of dominant B. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain and Brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive\n\nThe counts are indeed 9:3:3:1. However, the options seem to group them differently. Option D lists:\n\n- Checkered red 1\n- Checkered brown 3\n- Plain red 9\n- Plain brown 3\n\nWhich could imply that:\n\n- Checkered birds have either red or brown fur, depending on the B allele.\nWait, no\u2014it's about the phenotype, not the genotype. So a bird is classified as checkered if it has the recessive c allele (plain) and the dominant B allele (brown). If it has the recessive c and the recessive b alleles, it's plain red. Pigment red comes from having the dominant C allele but the recessive c allele (so it's plain, but the pigment is due to C). Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Actually, a bird is classified as:\n\n- Checkered if it has the recessive c (so plain) and dominant B (brown)\n- Plain if it has recessive c and recessive b (so plain, even though it has B alleles)\n- Pigment red if it has dominant C and any B (but wait, no\u2014if it's recessive c, it's plain, but if it has dominant C and dominant B, it's red. If it has dominant C and recessive B, it's red. If it has recessive c and dominant B, it's brown. If it has recessive c and recessive B, it's plain.)\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (Red/Brown):\n  - Red: C (dominant) is present\n  - Brown: B (dominant) is present\n\n- Body color (Checkered/Plain):\n  - Checkered: recessive c (plain) is present\n  - Plain: recessive c and b (no pigment)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant C and dominant B leads to red and brown respectively. The presence of recessive c (plain) and dominant B leads to brown. The presence of recessive c and recessive b leads to plain. The presence of recessive c (plain) and recessive b (even though B is present) also leads to plain.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nThe frequency for each is:\n\n- 9/16 for C and B\n- 3/16 for C and b\n- 3/16 for c and B\n- 1/16 for c and b\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nBut the options don't match this exactly. Looking at option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2014 this seems to indicate:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part (plain and brown without pigment)\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts (only brown)\n- Plain red: 9 parts (only plain)\n- Plain brown: 3 parts (both plain and brown)\n\nWait, this doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Perhaps the options are grouping the phenotypes incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the options use different terminology. Let me read the options again:\n\nLooking back, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nIf we interpret this as:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 9 parts\n- Plain brown: 3 parts\n\nThis adds up to 1+3+9+3=16 parts, which matches the denominator of 16. So according to this, the ratio is 1:3:9:3. Which corresponds to the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7... Wait, no, the 1:3:9:3 ratio isn't standard. Normally, the 9:3:3:1 ratio is used, but this is a different grouping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance. For example:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nSo, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. Option D has 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3, but in reverse. Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. For instance, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014so perhaps:\n\n- Number of Checkered red birds: 1\n- Number of Checkered brown birds: 3\n- Number of Plain red birds: 9\n- Number of Plain brown birds: 3\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, which makes sense. So the ratio is 1:3:9:3. This would correspond to the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, it's the sum of the squares of the coefficients in the expansion of (C + b)^2*(B + b)^2. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is that each phenotype is represented by the number of individuals in each category. So, in the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- 9 Checkered red (Pigment red and Brown)\n- 3 Checkered brown (Pigment red and Checkered)\n- 3 Plain red (Plain and Brown)\n- 1 Plain brown (Plain and Checkered)\n\nBut the options don't specify which phenotype is which; instead, they provide the count of each phenotype type. So, for example, if the correct answer is 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown, then option D correctly reflects that with \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" being the inverse of what's needed. Wait, no\u2014it's not the inverse. Because according to our analysis, the Checkered red should be 3, not 1, unless I'm making a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider:\n\n- Pigment red indicates the presence of dominant C.\n- Brown indicates the presence of dominant B.\n\nSo, a bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant (9/16)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, B recessive (3/16)\n3. Plain and Brown: c and B dominant (3/16)\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and B recessive (1/16)\n\nSo, the counts are indeed 9, 3, 3, 1. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly reflect this except possibly option D if it's reversed, but option D says Checkered red 1, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the question asks for the phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross involves two genes, so the F2 generation would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options suggest different groupings. Option D seems to group Checkered red with plain red, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of each phenotype in the order Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, which would correspond to 3:1:9:3, which is not correct. Wait, no\u2014the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but among the choices, option D groups the numbers in a certain way that might be considered correct if interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of birds with specific characteristics rather than the overall F2 population. For instance, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, and Plain brown birds in the F2 generation. In that case, the correct counts are 9, 3, 3, 1, which would correspond to the Checkered red (9), Checkered brown (3), Plain red (3), and Plain brown (1). But none of the options match this exactly. Option D says Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. From the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options do not directly reflect this. Option D groups the numbers differently, but perhaps the intended answer is D because it lists the phenotypes in a particular order, despite the numerical discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which sums to 16 and fits the 16 bird count. But in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but option D is the closest, albeit inverted.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of dominance, not the actual count. For example, in the F2 generation, the number of Checkered red birds would be higher because they require both recessive alleles (c and b), whereas others require only one. But that's not how phenotypic ratios work\u2014they are based on the combination of alleles, not just dominance.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is option D, even though the numerical values don't exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. It's possible that the question uses a simplified approach or there's a typo in the options. Therefore, I'll choose option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

The F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (mixed)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for one gene. Similarly for the B locus. But since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios.\n\nSo for pigment color:\n- 25% red (C present)\n- 50% mixed (Cc)\n- 25% plain (cc)\n\nFor body color:\n- 25% brown (B present)\n- 50% mixed (Bb)\n- 25% checkered (bb)\n\nBut since the presence of dominant alleles in either gene results in the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio combines these. The actual phenotypes observed would be combinations of pigment and body colors. For example, a bird could be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (if both C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we consider the possible combinations. However, the question specifies to use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. Now, converting these into phenotypes requires knowing how many of each genotype lead to which phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red (C dominant), Body brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented red (C dominant), Body brown (B present, since B is dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigmented red (C present), Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C present), Body brown (since B is dominant in Bb) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigmented red (C present), Body checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Checkered checkered\n7. cc BB: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Checkered checkered\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Only from genotype CC BB and Cc BB. That's 25% + 25% = 50%\n- **Checkered brown**: From CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, but wait, no\u2014each of those genotypes corresponds to different phenotypes. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's clarify:\n\nEach phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not. So:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Only one genotype: cc bb.\n- **Checkered brown**: One gene is dominant (B present), other is recessive (b absent). So, Cc (for pigment) and bb (body), or cc (pigment) and Bb (body).\nWait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype | Pigment | Body Color\n---|---|---\nCheckered red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | No | No\nPlain brown | No | Yes\n\nSo, looking back:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigmented red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigmented plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered checkered\n\nWait, that seems off because some of these may overlap. Let me recount:\n\n- **Checkered red** comes from CC BB (phenotype: red pigmented, brown body) and Cc bb (red pigmented, checkered body). So two genotypes correspond to Checkered red.\n- **Checkered brown** comes from CC Bb (red pigmented, brown body) and cc bb (plain pigmented, checkered body) plus Cc BB and Cc Bb (red pigmented, brown body). So four genotypes: CC Bb, cc bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- **Plain red** comes from cc BB (plain pigmented, brown body) and cc Bb (plain pigmented, brown body). Two genotypes.\n- **Plain brown** comes from CC BB (red pigmented, brown body), CC Bb (red pigmented, brown body), Cc BB (red pigmented, brown body), and Cc Bb (red pigmented, brown body). Four genotypes.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach phenotype group corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- **Checkered red (CR)**: Only CC BB \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered brown (CB)**: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 each 25% \u2192 total 75%?\nWait, no, because each genotype is a combination of two traits. Actually, the phenotypic ratio isn't additive like that. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So, the actual counts are based on the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For each gene, determine the probability of each outcome:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(red) = 25% (CC)\n- P(mixed) = 50% (Cc)\n- P(plain) = 25% (cc)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- P(brown) = 25% (BB)\n- P(mixed) = 50% (Bb)\n- P(checkered) = 25% (bb)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined phenotypic probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities for each trait. However, this might not directly apply because the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. Instead, the combined phenotypic ratio can be found by enumerating all possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nThere are 4 possible phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (CR-BB)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (CR-bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cr-BB)\n4. Plain and checkered (cr-bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n1. CR-BB: P(red) * P(brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. CR-bb: P(red) * P(checkered) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. cr-BB: P(plain) * P(brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. cr-bb: P(plain) * P(checkered) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25% total. This makes sense because the F2 generation is 25% for each of the four phenotypes, totaling 100%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier enumeration suggested four groups. Maybe my approach was flawed. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each bird has two independent traits, so the four phenotypes are combinations of the two. The correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is to consider each possible combination of the two traits, weighted by their probabilities.\n\nUsing the formula for independent events:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nWhere A is the pigment trait and B is the body trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (CR-BB): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (CR-bb): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n3. Plain and brown (cr-BB): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n4. Plain and checkered (cr-bb): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nTotal: 25% each for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 25% each.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,8,2,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 6,8,4,4 \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Not matching\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Matching!\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching\nK. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nL. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Not matching\nM. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching\nN. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nO. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Matches!\n\nSo option F says 4,4,4,4, which matches our calculation of 25% each. Therefore, the correct answer should be option J, which states \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\"\n\nWait, no\u2014the numbering in the options seems to be sequential. Looking back, the options are labeled from A to N, with each having numbers corresponding to the phenotypes. Option F is \"4,4,4,4,\" which would mean each phenotype accounts for 4 parts out of 16. If the total F2 population is 16, then each phenotype would indeed be 4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that the F2 population is derived from the F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. The F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (mixed)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for one gene. Similarly for the B locus. But since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios.\n\nSo for pigment color:\n- 25% red (C present)\n- 50% mixed (Cc)\n- 25% plain (cc)\n\nFor body color:\n- 25% brown (B present)\n- 50% mixed (Bb)\n- 25% checkered (bb)\n\nBut since the presence of dominant alleles in either gene results in the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio combines these. The actual phenotypes observed would be combinations of pigment and body colors. For example, a bird could be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (if both C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we consider the possible combinations. However, the question specifies to use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. Now, converting these into phenotypes requires knowing how many of each genotype lead to which phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red (C dominant), Body brown (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented red (C dominant), Body brown (B present, since B is dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigmented red (C present), Body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigmented red (C present), Body brown (since B is dominant in Bb) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigmented red (C present), Body checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Checkered checkered\n7. cc BB: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigmented plain (c), Body checkered (since b is recessive) \u2192 Checkered checkered\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Only from genotype CC BB and Cc BB. That's 25% + 25% = 50%\n- **Checkered brown**: From CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, but wait, no\u2014each of those genotypes corresponds to different phenotypes. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's clarify:\n\nEach phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not. So:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Only one genotype: cc bb.\n- **Checkered brown**: One gene is dominant (B present), other is recessive (b absent). So, Cc (for pigment) and bb (body), or cc (pigment) and Bb (body).\nWait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype | Pigment | Body Color\n---|---|---\nCheckered red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | No | No\nPlain brown | No | Yes\n\nSo, looking back:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Pigmented red, Checkered \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb: Pigmented plain, Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb: Pigmented plain, Checkered \u2192 Checkered checkered\n\nWait, that seems off because some of these may overlap. Let me recount:\n\n- **Checkered red** comes from CC BB (phenotype: red pigmented, brown body) and Cc bb (red pigmented, checkered body). So two genotypes correspond to Checkered red.\n- **Checkered brown** comes from CC Bb (red pigmented, brown body) and cc bb (plain pigmented, checkered body) plus Cc BB and Cc Bb (red pigmented, brown body). So four genotypes: CC Bb, cc bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- **Plain red** comes from cc BB (plain pigmented, brown body) and cc Bb (plain pigmented, brown body). Two genotypes.\n- **Plain brown** comes from CC BB (red pigmented, brown body), CC Bb (red pigmented, brown body), Cc BB (red pigmented, brown body), and Cc Bb (red pigmented, brown body). Four genotypes.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach phenotype group corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- **Checkered red (CR)**: Only CC BB \u2192 25%\n- **Checkered brown (CB)**: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 each 25% \u2192 total 75%?\nWait, no, because each genotype is a combination of two traits. Actually, the phenotypic ratio isn't additive like that. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So, the actual counts are based on the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For each gene, determine the probability of each outcome:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(red) = 25% (CC)\n- P(mixed) = 50% (Cc)\n- P(plain) = 25% (cc)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- P(brown) = 25% (BB)\n- P(mixed) = 50% (Bb)\n- P(checkered) = 25% (bb)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined phenotypic probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities for each trait. However, this might not directly apply because the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. Instead, the combined phenotypic ratio can be found by enumerating all possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nThere are 4 possible phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (CR-BB)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (CR-bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cr-BB)\n4. Plain and checkered (cr-bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n1. CR-BB: P(red) * P(brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. CR-bb: P(red) * P(checkered) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. cr-BB: P(plain) * P(brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. cr-bb: P(plain) * P(checkered) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25% total. This makes sense because the F2 generation is 25% for each of the four phenotypes, totaling 100%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier enumeration suggested four groups. Maybe my approach was flawed. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each bird has two independent traits, so the four phenotypes are combinations of the two. The correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratio is to consider each possible combination of the two traits, weighted by their probabilities.\n\nUsing the formula for independent events:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nWhere A is the pigment trait and B is the body trait.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (CR-BB): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (CR-bb): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n3. Plain and brown (cr-BB): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n4. Plain and checkered (cr-bb): (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nTotal: 25% each for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or 25% each.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,8,2,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 6,8,4,4 \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Not matching\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Matching!\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching\nK. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nL. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Not matching\nM. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching\nN. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not matching\nO. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Matches!\n\nSo option F says 4,4,4,4, which matches our calculation of 25% each. Therefore, the correct answer should be option J, which states \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\"\n\nWait, no\u2014the numbering in the options seems to be sequential. Looking back, the options are labeled from A to N, with each having numbers corresponding to the phenotypes. Option F is \"4,4,4,4,\" which would mean each phenotype accounts for 4 parts out of 16. If the total F2 population is 16, then each phenotype would indeed be 4. So the correct answer is option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "chunk_resampled": "For example, the probability that both C and B are dominant (so red and brown) is (probability C is dominant)^2 * (probability B is dominant)^2 = (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^2?",
    "rollout": " For example, the probability that both C and B are dominant (so red and brown) is (probability C is dominant)^2 * (probability B is dominant)^2 = (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^2? Wait, no\u2014that applies if the genes are linked, but here they\u2019re independent. Actually, for each gene, the probability of being dominant is higher than recessive. But in this case, we don't know the degree of dominance; instead, we're given the presence of alleles. So the phenotypic ratio would depend on the actual presence of the alleles. For simplicity, let's assume that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigmented red: requires C (dominant) and B (dominant)\n- Pigmented brown: requires C (dominant) and b (recessive)\n- Plain: requires c (recessive) for both C and B\n- Checkered: requires c for C and B dominant\n\nBut wait, the genes are independent, so the probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each trait:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., pigment red): 1 - (probability of c for both copies) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (i.e., brown body): 1 - (probability of b for both copies) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability of both traits being present (pigmented red and brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Pigmented red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which adds up to 16 parts. However, looking at the options provided, none directly match this ratio. The options given are:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A to H, with various ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are different because the dominance might affect the counts differently. Maybe each phenotype isn't equally likely because some phenotypes may not occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe the possible phenotypes differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the number of individuals expressing each phenotype. Given that the F2 generation consists of four possible genotypic combinations, each leading to a specific phenotype. Let me list them:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n3. Ccbb \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. ccBB \u2192 Plain and brown\n5. ccBb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n6. ccbb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible gametes from F1 selfing. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 would include all possible combinations of the alleles for each gene, considering the independent assortment. So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC Bb (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC bb (plain, brown body)\n- CC bb (wait, no, CC BB is one possibility, then CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of each phenotype. Let's see:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: This occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present. That would be:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 1\n  - CC Bb \u2192 1\n  - CC bb \u2192 1\n  - Cc BB \u2192 1\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 1\n  - Cc bb \u2192 1 (but wait, if a bird has Cc and bb, it's Cc bb, which is pigmented red and brown?)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Pigmented red means at least one dominant C, and brown means at least one dominant B. Plain means both recessive (cc and bb).\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: C and B are dominant \u2192 any combination except cc and bb.\n- Pigmented red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 C present, B recessive.\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 c recessive, B dominant.\n- Plain and checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 c and c, and B and b.\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each bird is produced by crossing two F1 birds (CcBb). The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC Bb (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC bb (plain, brown body)\n- CC bb \u2192 same as above?\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider all combinations:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB, cb, cB, and cb, but since each parent contributes one allele, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom F1: Cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n\nWhen selfed, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, leading to 16 possible phenotypes (but many would be similar). However, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being dominant (since each has a 1/2 chance of passing the dominant allele). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for both traits being present.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. For example, the probability that both C and B are dominant (so red and brown) is (probability C is dominant)^2 * (probability B is dominant)^2 = (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^2? Wait, no\u2014that applies if the genes are linked, but here they\u2019re independent. Actually, for each gene, the probability of being dominant is higher than recessive. But in this case, we don't know the degree of dominance; instead, we're given the presence of alleles. So the phenotypic ratio would depend on the actual presence of the alleles. For simplicity, let's assume that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigmented red: requires C (dominant) and B (dominant)\n- Pigmented brown: requires C (dominant) and b (recessive)\n- Plain: requires c (recessive) for both C and B\n- Checkered: requires c for C and B dominant\n\nBut wait, the genes are independent, so the probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each trait:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., pigment red): 1 - (probability of c for both copies) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (i.e., brown body): 1 - (probability of b for both copies) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability of both traits being present (pigmented red and brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Pigmented red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which adds up to 16 parts. However, looking at the options provided, none directly match this ratio. The options given are:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A to H, with various ratios. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16, but the ratios aren't matching 9:3:3:1.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, but the third category is zero, which doesn't make sense since both recessive alleles are possible.\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 18, which is over 16.\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are different because the dominance might affect the counts differently. Maybe each phenotype isn't equally likely because some phenotypes may not occur. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe the possible phenotypes differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the number of individuals expressing each phenotype. Given that the F2 generation consists of four possible genotypic combinations, each leading to a specific phenotype. Let me list them:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n3. Ccbb \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. ccBB \u2192 Plain and brown\n5. ccBb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n6. ccbb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible gametes from F1 selfing. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 would include all possible combinations of the alleles for each gene, considering the independent assortment. So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC Bb (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC bb (plain, brown body)\n- CC bb (wait, no, CC BB is one possibility, then CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of each phenotype. Let's see:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: This occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present. That would be:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 1\n  - CC Bb \u2192 1\n  - CC bb \u2192 1\n  - Cc BB \u2192 1\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 1\n  - Cc bb \u2192 1 (but wait, if a bird has Cc and bb, it's Cc bb, which is pigmented red and brown?)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Pigmented red means at least one dominant C, and brown means at least one dominant B. Plain means both recessive (cc and bb).\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: C and B are dominant \u2192 any combination except cc and bb.\n- Pigmented red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 C present, B recessive.\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 c recessive, B dominant.\n- Plain and checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 c and c, and B and b.\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each bird is produced by crossing two F1 birds (CcBb). The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC Bb (pigmented red, brown body)\n- CC bb (plain, brown body)\n- CC bb \u2192 same as above?\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider all combinations:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB, cb, cB, and cb, but since each parent contributes one allele, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom F1: Cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n\nWhen selfed, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, leading to 16 possible phenotypes (but many would be similar). However, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being dominant (since each has a 1/2 chance of passing the dominant allele). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for both traits being present. Similarly:\n\n- Both traits dominant: 9/16\n- Pigmented red and checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain and checkered: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Looking at the options, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That aligns perfectly with our calculation: 9 plain-red and checkered, 3 plain-red and brown, 9 checkered-red, 3 checkered-brown. Wait, no\u2014it's the reverse. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nWait, in my earlier breakdown, the phenotypic categories were:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (phenotype 1): 9/16\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (phenotype 2): 3/16\n3. Plain and brown (phenotype 3): 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered (phenotype 4): 1/16\n\nBut the options are presented as:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich matches exactly with the numbers I've got: 9 plain-red and checkered (phenotype 4?), 3 plain-red and brown (phenotype 2?), 9 checkered-red (phenotype 1?), 3 checkered-brown (phenotype 3?)\u2014no, wait, perhaps I mixed up the order.

Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are expressed, the combination depends on the interaction. However, according to the given options, the user seems to have grouped the phenotypes into 'checkered red', 'checkered brown', etc., implying that both traits are expressed together. So the four phenotypes would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: (c and b \u2192 plain and checkered)\n- Checkered brown: (c and B \u2192 plain and brown)\n- Red brown: (C and B \u2192 red and brown)\n- Red checkered: (C and b \u2192 red and checkered)\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none exactly match these categories directly. Instead, the user lists phenotypes like \"checkered red,\" which might mean that the bird is plain (because c is recessive) but has some brown color due to the B allele. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean plain but brown.\n\nWait, but in standard genetics, a bird that's checkered usually refers to having both c and b alleles, resulting in a blend of plain and checkered colors. However, in this case, perhaps the terms are used differently. Let me re-examine the question:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene B.\n- Brown color by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, a bird with the genotype ccbb would be plain and checkered. A bird with Ccbb would be red and checkered. CcBb would be red and brown. And ccBB would be plain and brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- If an allele pair is cc (recessive for both genes), then it results in plain and checkered.\n- If either C or c is present but the other is recessive, it's either red or plain, depending on which gene is active.\n- If both C and B are present, it's red and brown.\n- Only if both c and b are present (ccbb) does it become plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown), resulting in red and brown. A bird with Ccbb would have C (red) and b (checkered), resulting in red and checkered. A bird with ccBB would have c (plain) and B (brown), resulting in plain and brown. A bird with ccbb would have c and b, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Red and Brown (RrBb): This includes CcBb and CcBb (wait, actually, any bird where C is present and B is present).\n2. Red and Checkered (Rrbb): Includes Ccbb.\n3. Plain and Brown (rrBb): Includes ccBB.\n4. Plain and Checkered (rrbb): Includes ccbb.\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of each type of bird there are in the F2 generation. Since each parent contributes gametes that are 50% CcBb (which is C and B) and 50% ccbb (which is c and b), the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of F1 selfing.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (half C and half c)\n- 25% cc (all c dominant)\n- 25% BB (all B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (half B and half b)\n- 25% bb (all b dominant)\n\nBut wait, in our case, each parent contributes either CcBb (which is C and B) or ccbb (which is c and b). So F2 would have:\n\n- 25% (CC \u00d7 ccBb): So the F2 would have 25% (C \u00d7 c) for pigment and 25% (B \u00d7 b) for color. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014because each gene segregates independently, the F2 would have four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- C: present (red) or absent (plain)\n- B: present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n\nSimilarly for c and b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red and brown (RrBb)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Rrbb)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (rrBb)\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain and checkered (rrbb)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. Since each parent contributes gametes at a 50% chance, each F2 genotype has a 25% chance. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may express the same phenotype. For example, CcBb and Ccbb would both result in red and brown, whereas CcBb and CcBb would also be red and brown regardless of whether they carry the b allele or not. Wait, no\u2014C is present in both cases, and B is present, so both would express red and brown. Similarly, CcBb and CcBb are the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So C being present results in red, regardless of B. B being present results in brown, regardless of C. So the actual phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits: if C is present and B is present, it's red and brown; if C is present and B is absent, it's red and checkered; if C is absent and B is present, it's plain and brown; if both are absent, it's plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the frequency of each genotype:\n\n- RrBb: 25% of F2\n- Rrbb: 25% of F2\n- rrBb: 25% of F2\n- rrbb: 25% of F2\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- RrBb (red and brown) occurs 25% of the time\n- Rrbb (red and checkered) occurs 25% of the time\n- rrBb (plain and brown) occurs 25% of the time\n- rrbb (plain and checkered) occurs 25% of the time\n\nHowever, wait\u2014this isn't correct because the presence of the dominant allele doesn't affect the other. For example, RrBb would always have R (red) and B (brown), regardless of the alleles for the other gene. Similarly, Rrbb would have R (red) and b (checkered). So the four phenotypes are indeed represented as above, each at 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, they don't all list four phenotypes. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions A to J include different ratios. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Hmm, but the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross typically has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled appropriately. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts. So each part corresponds to a certain number of birds.\n\nLet me recalculate the F2 ratio properly. In F2, the four phenotypes occur with the following counts (assuming 100 birds):\n\n- RrBb: 25%\n- Rrbb: 25%\n- rrBb: 25%\n- rrbb: 25%\n\nBut considering dominance, each of these would express the corresponding traits without needing further segregation. So the four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring at 25% of the F2 population. However, in terms of the answer options, they seem to group phenotypes into categories like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red\", which might imply that the checkered phenotype is considered as \"plain\" in this context. Wait, no\u2014the problem statement uses specific terms: \"checkered\" and \"plain\". So perhaps in the context of the question, \"checkered\" refers to the presence of the recessive alleles for both genes, leading to a blend of checkered and plain. But perhaps the intended grouping is that a bird with either c or b (i.e., plain) is called \"checkered\" and vice versa. This could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that checkered and plain are separate phenotypes, and the colors are expressed separately. So, let's approach this methodically:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive (ccbb): Plain and checkered (let's call this \"plain\")\n2. One gene is recessive (either c or b), the other is dominant (C or B): \n   - C is dominant (red) and b is recessive (checkered): Red and checkered (let's call this \"red\")\n   - c is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown): Plain and brown (let's call this \"brown\")\n3. Both genes are dominant (CCBB): Red and brown (let's call this \"both\")\n\nNow, the number of birds in each category depends on the probability of each genotype.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype:\n\n- 25% CCBB (both dominant): Both phenotype (both red and brown)\n- 25% CCbb (C dominant, b recessive): Red and checkered\n- 25% CcBB (c recessive, B dominant): Plain and brown\n- 25% ccBB (both recessive): Plain and checkered\n\nAdditionally, the genotypes CCbb, CcBB, and Ccbb each combine to give specific phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014each bird's genotype contributes to their phenotype based on the combination of the two genes. So for each bird:\n\n- CCBB: Both dominant \u2192 Both red and brown\n- CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- ccBB: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nAnd the other possible genotypes:\n\n- CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- Ccbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have both dominant alleles for both genes, resulting in both red and brown. A bird with genotype CcBb would still have both dominant alleles, so both red and brown.\n\nWait, now I realize that my previous approach was flawed because the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits, not just the presence of each gene. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether both genes are active (i.e., both dominant) or not. Thus, the phenotype is either:\n\n- Both red and brown (if both C and B are dominant)\n- Red and checkered (if C is dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nNow, the count of each phenotype in F2 depends on the number of each genotype contributing to that phenotype. Let's consider each possible genotype and its contribution to each phenotype:\n\n1. CCBB: Both dominant \u2192 Both red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CCBb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. CcBb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Both red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Ccbb: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. ccBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. ccBb: c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n9. ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, each of these nine genotypes contributes to the respective phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB and CcBB \u2192 25% each \u2192 Total 50%\n- Phenotype 2: CCBb, CCbb, CcBB, CcBB? Wait, no\u2014each genotype's contribution is 25%, so:\n\nPhenotype 2 comes from CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and CcBB (25%). Wait, no\u2014each of these is a unique genotype, each contributing 25% to their respective phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCCBB | Both red and brown\nCCBb | Red and checkered\nCCbb | Red and checkered\nCcBB | Plain and brown\nCcBb | Both red and brown\nCcbb | Red and checkered\nccBB | Plain and brown\nccBb | Red and checkered\nccbb | Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype. Each phenotype arises from multiple genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Both red and brown): CCBB (25%) and CcBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and checkered): CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and CcBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each of those genotypes represents a separate phenotype, but actually, in reality, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So each of these genotypes contributes to their respective phenotype:\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Each bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype in terms of the two genes. So the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the sum of the probabilities of each phenotype arising from each genotype. Let's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Both red and brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant. This happens in CCBB (25%) and CcBB (25%), plus CcBb and CcBB. Wait, no\u2014CCBB and CcBB both have both C and B dominant, giving both red and brown. CcBb also has both C and B dominant, so it also falls under Phenotype 1. Similarly, CcBB would also fall under Phenotype 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014CCBB has both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCCBb has C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCCbb has C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCcBB has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCcBb has C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCcbb has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 2\nccBB has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\nccBb has c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4\nccbb has both c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's count the number of genotypes per phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB (25%), CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 2: CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), cccB (wait, no\u2014ccBb is CcBb? No, ccBb would be c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 2. So CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and ccBb (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 3: cccB (no, that's ccBB) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014phenotype 3 is plain and brown, which occurs in CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%), and ccBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 4: ccbb (25%) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, this doesn't add up correctly. Let me recount:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB (25%), CcBB (25",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's compute the number of each phenotypic category:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (Red): 75%\n- Absence (Plain): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (Brown): 75%\n- Absence (Checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is multiplication. The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B): (75% * 75%) = 56.25%\n2. Red (C) and Checkered (b): (75% * 25%) = 18.75%\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are expressed, the combination depends on the interaction. However, according to the given options, the user seems to have grouped the phenotypes into 'checkered red', 'checkered brown', etc., implying that both traits are expressed together. So the four phenotypes would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: (c and b \u2192 plain and checkered)\n- Checkered brown: (c and B \u2192 plain and brown)\n- Red brown: (C and B \u2192 red and brown)\n- Red checkered: (C and b \u2192 red and checkered)\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none exactly match these categories directly. Instead, the user lists phenotypes like \"checkered red,\" which might mean that the bird is plain (because c is recessive) but has some brown color due to the B allele. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean plain but brown.\n\nWait, but in standard genetics, a bird that's checkered usually refers to having both c and b alleles, resulting in a blend of plain and checkered colors. However, in this case, perhaps the terms are used differently. Let me re-examine the question:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene B.\n- Brown color by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, a bird with the genotype ccbb would be plain and checkered. A bird with Ccbb would be red and checkered. CcBb would be red and brown. And ccBB would be plain and brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- If an allele pair is cc (recessive for both genes), then it results in plain and checkered.\n- If either C or c is present but the other is recessive, it's either red or plain, depending on which gene is active.\n- If both C and B are present, it's red and brown.\n- Only if both c and b are present (ccbb) does it become plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown), resulting in red and brown. A bird with Ccbb would have C (red) and b (checkered), resulting in red and checkered. A bird with ccBB would have c (plain) and B (brown), resulting in plain and brown. A bird with ccbb would have c and b, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Red and Brown (RrBb): This includes CcBb and CcBb (wait, actually, any bird where C is present and B is present).\n2. Red and Checkered (Rrbb): Includes Ccbb.\n3. Plain and Brown (rrBb): Includes ccBB.\n4. Plain and Checkered (rrbb): Includes ccbb.\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of each type of bird there are in the F2 generation. Since each parent contributes gametes that are 50% CcBb (which is C and B) and 50% ccbb (which is c and b), the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the result of F1 selfing.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (half C and half c)\n- 25% cc (all c dominant)\n- 25% BB (all B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (half B and half b)\n- 25% bb (all b dominant)\n\nBut wait, in our case, each parent contributes either CcBb (which is C and B) or ccbb (which is c and b). So F2 would have:\n\n- 25% (CC \u00d7 ccBb): So the F2 would have 25% (C \u00d7 c) for pigment and 25% (B \u00d7 b) for color. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014because each gene segregates independently, the F2 would have four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- C: present (red) or absent (plain)\n- B: present (brown) or absent (checkered)\n\nSimilarly for c and b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red and brown (RrBb)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Rrbb)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (rrBb)\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain and checkered (rrbb)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. Since each parent contributes gametes at a 50% chance, each F2 genotype has a 25% chance. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may express the same phenotype. For example, CcBb and Ccbb would both result in red and brown, whereas CcBb and CcBb would also be red and brown regardless of whether they carry the b allele or not. Wait, no\u2014C is present in both cases, and B is present, so both would express red and brown. Similarly, CcBb and CcBb are the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So C being present results in red, regardless of B. B being present results in brown, regardless of C. So the actual phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits: if C is present and B is present, it's red and brown; if C is present and B is absent, it's red and checkered; if C is absent and B is present, it's plain and brown; if both are absent, it's plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the frequency of each genotype:\n\n- RrBb: 25% of F2\n- Rrbb: 25% of F2\n- rrBb: 25% of F2\n- rrbb: 25% of F2\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- RrBb (red and brown) occurs 25% of the time\n- Rrbb (red and checkered) occurs 25% of the time\n- rrBb (plain and brown) occurs 25% of the time\n- rrbb (plain and checkered) occurs 25% of the time\n\nHowever, wait\u2014this isn't correct because the presence of the dominant allele doesn't affect the other. For example, RrBb would always have R (red) and B (brown), regardless of the alleles for the other gene. Similarly, Rrbb would have R (red) and b (checkered). So the four phenotypes are indeed represented as above, each at 25%.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, they don't all list four phenotypes. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions A to J include different ratios. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Hmm, but the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross typically has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled appropriately. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16 parts. So each part corresponds to a certain number of birds.\n\nLet me recalculate the F2 ratio properly. In F2, the four phenotypes occur with the following counts (assuming 100 birds):\n\n- RrBb: 25%\n- Rrbb: 25%\n- rrBb: 25%\n- rrbb: 25%\n\nBut considering dominance, each of these would express the corresponding traits without needing further segregation. So the four phenotypes are equally likely, each occurring at 25% of the F2 population. However, in terms of the answer options, they seem to group phenotypes into categories like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red\", which might imply that the checkered phenotype is considered as \"plain\" in this context. Wait, no\u2014the problem statement uses specific terms: \"checkered\" and \"plain\". So perhaps in the context of the question, \"checkered\" refers to the presence of the recessive alleles for both genes, leading to a blend of checkered and plain. But perhaps the intended grouping is that a bird with either c or b (i.e., plain) is called \"checkered\" and vice versa. This could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that checkered and plain are separate phenotypes, and the colors are expressed separately. So, let's approach this methodically:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Both genes are recessive (ccbb): Plain and checkered (let's call this \"plain\")\n2. One gene is recessive (either c or b), the other is dominant (C or B): \n   - C is dominant (red) and b is recessive (checkered): Red and checkered (let's call this \"red\")\n   - c is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown): Plain and brown (let's call this \"brown\")\n3. Both genes are dominant (CCBB): Red and brown (let's call this \"both\")\n\nNow, the number of birds in each category depends on the probability of each genotype.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype:\n\n- 25% CCBB (both dominant): Both phenotype (both red and brown)\n- 25% CCbb (C dominant, b recessive): Red and checkered\n- 25% CcBB (c recessive, B dominant): Plain and brown\n- 25% ccBB (both recessive): Plain and checkered\n\nAdditionally, the genotypes CCbb, CcBB, and Ccbb each combine to give specific phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014each bird's genotype contributes to their phenotype based on the combination of the two genes. So for each bird:\n\n- CCBB: Both dominant \u2192 Both red and brown\n- CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- ccBB: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nAnd the other possible genotypes:\n\n- CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- Ccbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered\n- ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb would have both dominant alleles for both genes, resulting in both red and brown. A bird with genotype CcBb would still have both dominant alleles, so both red and brown.\n\nWait, now I realize that my previous approach was flawed because the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits, not just the presence of each gene. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether both genes are active (i.e., both dominant) or not. Thus, the phenotype is either:\n\n- Both red and brown (if both C and B are dominant)\n- Red and checkered (if C is dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nNow, the count of each phenotype in F2 depends on the number of each genotype contributing to that phenotype. Let's consider each possible genotype and its contribution to each phenotype:\n\n1. CCBB: Both dominant \u2192 Both red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CCBb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CCbb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. CcBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. CcBb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Both red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Ccbb: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. ccBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. ccBb: c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n9. ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, each of these nine genotypes contributes to the respective phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB and CcBB \u2192 25% each \u2192 Total 50%\n- Phenotype 2: CCBb, CCbb, CcBB, CcBB? Wait, no\u2014each genotype's contribution is 25%, so:\n\nPhenotype 2 comes from CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and CcBB (25%). Wait, no\u2014each of these is a unique genotype, each contributing 25% to their respective phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCCBB | Both red and brown\nCCBb | Red and checkered\nCCbb | Red and checkered\nCcBB | Plain and brown\nCcBb | Both red and brown\nCcbb | Red and checkered\nccBB | Plain and brown\nccBb | Red and checkered\nccbb | Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype. Each phenotype arises from multiple genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Both red and brown): CCBB (25%) and CcBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and checkered): CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and CcBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75% \u2192 Wait, no\u2014each of those genotypes represents a separate phenotype, but actually, in reality, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So each of these genotypes contributes to their respective phenotype:\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Each bird's phenotype is determined by their genotype in terms of the two genes. So the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the sum of the probabilities of each phenotype arising from each genotype. Let's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Both red and brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant. This happens in CCBB (25%) and CcBB (25%), plus CcBb and CcBB. Wait, no\u2014CCBB and CcBB both have both C and B dominant, giving both red and brown. CcBb also has both C and B dominant, so it also falls under Phenotype 1. Similarly, CcBB would also fall under Phenotype 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014CCBB has both C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCCBb has C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCCbb has C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCcBB has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCcBb has C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCcbb has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 2\nccBB has c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 3\nccBb has c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype 4\nccbb has both c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's count the number of genotypes per phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB (25%), CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 2: CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), cccB (wait, no\u2014ccBb is CcBb? No, ccBb would be c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype 2. So CCBb (25%), CCbb (25%), and ccBb (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 3: cccB (no, that's ccBB) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014phenotype 3 is plain and brown, which occurs in CcBB (25%), CcBb (25%), and ccBB (25%) \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype 4: ccbb (25%) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, this doesn't add up correctly. Let me recount:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CCBB (25%), CcBB (25",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Given that the F2 generation is produced by selfing F1, which is CcBb, the F2 will have the following probabilities:",
    "rollout": " Given that the F2 generation is produced by selfing F1, which is CcBb, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., C_: 3/4)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (i.e., B_: 3/4)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3.

Looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. That makes sense because 9+3+3+1=16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none match exactly except option G which states 12:2:2:0. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 16. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). The presence of dominant alleles results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: dominant C\n- Plain: recessive c\n- Brown: dominant B\n- Checkered: recessive b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown \u2192 (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered \u2192 (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND Brown \u2192 (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain AND Checkered \u2192 (c and b recessive)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- For Pigment red AND Brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red AND Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain AND Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain AND Checkered: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 sum 24 (but likely scaled differently)\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nO. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nQ. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nR. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nS. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nT. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nU. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nV. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nW. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nX. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nY. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nZ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nLooking through these, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, also adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. Option H is 5:3:2:6, adding to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, adding to 12. Option I is 7:5:1:3, adding to 16. Option K is 4:4:4:4, adding to 16. Option L is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16. Option M is 1:3:9:3, same as J. Option N is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option O is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option Q is 12:2:2:0, same as G. Option R is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option S is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option T is 2:6:3:1, same as J. Option U is 4:4:4:4, same as K. Option V is 3:9:1:3, same as L. Option W is 1:3:9:3, same as M. Option X is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option Y is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option Z is 2:6:3:1, same as J.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these options matches the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation derived from the dihybrid cross. From earlier calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G (12:2:2:0) and option A (6:2:6:2). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because 9:3:3:1 isn't listed as an option. The closest option is G (12:2:2:0), which might represent a different calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each gene contributes independently, leading to 2^2 = 4 phenotypic classes, each with a certain frequency. The correct calculation for F2 would yield the phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options directly match this, perhaps the correct option is G (12:2:2:0), which seems off because 12+2+2+0=16, which fits 4:2:2:0. Wait, no\u2014it should be 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the order is different. Let me double-check:\n\nThe problem states:\n- Pigment color is C, where C is dominant (red)\n- Body color is B, where B is dominant (brown)\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer options directly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Sum 16, but it's different from 9:3:3:1.\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Sum 16, but again different.\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Sum 16, different from our desired 9:3:3:1.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Different.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Different.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Different.\nOption K: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Different.\nOption L: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Different.\nOption M: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as J.\nOption N: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption O: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Q: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Same as G.\nOption R: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption S: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption T: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Same as J.\nOption U: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Same as K.\nOption V: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Same as L.\nOption W: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as M.\nOption X: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Y: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Z: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Same as J.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio according to standard dihybrid crosses is 9:3:3:1, but among the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which may correspond to a different scaling or perhaps a miscalculation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the F1 ratios instead of the F2. Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, which we've determined to be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly match this. The closest is option G (12:2:2:0), which could imply that each class was multiplied by 2, making the ratio 12:2:2:0 instead of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify once again.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and dominant, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. This arises from the fact that each gene has three possible phenotypes, and with two independent genes, the number of phenotypic combinations is 3x3=9, but some phenotypes overlap due to dominance. Wait, no\u2014the actual count is 9:3:3:1 because:\n\n- 9 cases where both dominant (C and B)\n- 3 cases where C dominant and B recessive (C and b)\n- 3 cases where c dominant and B dominant (c and B)\n- 1 case where both recessive (c and b)\n\nYes, that adds up to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. Wait, looking back, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but perhaps it's scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is \"12,2,2,0\", which adds to 16, while option A is \"6,2,6,2\" also adding to 16. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of the F1 phenotypes rather than F2, but that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype relative to the others without simplifying the ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2, then express their ratio accordingly. Let me recast the F2 calculation properly.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. When crossed with itself, each gene segregates independently. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-mates, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThen, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nPigment red (C) and Brown (B) | 25% (from CC BB)\nPigment red (C) and Checkered (b) | 25% (from CC bb)\nPlain (c) and Brown (B) | 25% (from cc BB)\nPlain (c) and Checkered (b) | 25% (from cc bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes now needs to be mapped to specific letters:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options directly match this. However, looking closely, option G (12:2:2:0) suggests that the 9:3:3:1 ratio has been scaled by dividing each term by 0.75 (since 9 \u00f7 1.25 = 7.2, which doesn\u2019t fit). Alternatively, perhaps the options were presented incorrectly. Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, and the closest option is G (12:2:2:0), but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the question: the options list various ratios. The correct ratio according to my analysis is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none directly match this. However, option G (12:2:2:0) may represent a scenario where the number of each phenotype is doubled, but that doesn't align with the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the F1 phenotypes instead. Let me consider that.\n\nIf the question is asking about the F1 generation, which consists of CcBb, then the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (9/16)\n- Pigment red and Checkered (3/16)\n- Plain and Brown (3/16)\n- Plain and Checkered (1/16)\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, same as before. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, suggesting that each category is being counted twice, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider the dominance mapping.\n\nWait, the problem statement defines:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color (red)\n- B is dominant for body color (brown)\n\nThus, the dominance hierarchy is:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are ordered such that:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nWhich corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option G (12:2:2:0), which might be a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that would still be 9:3:3:1, which isn't an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are based on a different assumption. Let me try to compute the phenotypic ratios manually.\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nTotal: 16 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nComparing with the options, none match exactly. However, option G (12:2:2:0) might be a scaled version, but 12+2+2+0=16, whereas 9+3+3+1=16 as well. However, the ratios aren't proportional. For example, 9:3:3:1 vs. 12:2:2:0, the numbers don't scale uniformly. Similarly, option A (6:2:6:2) adds to 16, but the ratios are different. Option D (1:3:9:3) adds to 16 but is the opposite of what we expect. Option H (5:3:2:6) also adds to 16, but the ratios don't match. Option J (2:6:3:1) adds to 12, which doesn't fit. Option I (7:5:1:3) adds to 16, but the ratios are different. Option K (4:4:4:4) adds to 16, but it's all 4s. Option L (3:9:1:3) adds to 16, but again different. Option M (1:3:9:3) same as J. Option N (5:3:2:6) same as I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that the F2 generation is produced by selfing F1, which is CcBb, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., C_: 3/4)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one dominant B allele (i.e., B_: 3/4)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 9:16:3:1 or similar. Looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16. That makes sense because 9+3+3+1=16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none match exactly except option G which states 12:2:2:0. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 16. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C) and body color (B). The presence of dominant alleles results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red: dominant C\n- Plain: recessive c\n- Brown: dominant B\n- Checkered: recessive b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown \u2192 (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered \u2192 (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND Brown \u2192 (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain AND Checkered \u2192 (c and b recessive)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- For Pigment red AND Brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red AND Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain AND Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain AND Checkered: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer choices directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,8,4 \u2192 sum 24 (but likely scaled differently)\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nO. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nQ. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\nR. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nS. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nT. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\nU. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nV. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nW. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nX. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nY. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nZ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nLooking through these, option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, also adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. Option H is 5:3:2:6, adding to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, adding to 12. Option I is 7:5:1:3, adding to 16. Option K is 4:4:4:4, adding to 16. Option L is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16. Option M is 1:3:9:3, same as J. Option N is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option O is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option Q is 12:2:2:0, same as G. Option R is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option S is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option T is 2:6:3:1, same as J. Option U is 4:4:4:4, same as K. Option V is 3:9:1:3, same as L. Option W is 1:3:9:3, same as M. Option X is 5:3:2:6, same as I. Option Y is 7:5:1:3, same as I. Option Z is 2:6:3:1, same as J.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these options matches the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation derived from the dihybrid cross. From earlier calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G (12:2:2:0) and option A (6:2:6:2). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because 9:3:3:1 isn't listed as an option. The closest option is G (12:2:2:0), which might represent a different calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each gene contributes independently, leading to 2^2 = 4 phenotypic classes, each with a certain frequency. The correct calculation for F2 would yield the phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options directly match this, perhaps the correct option is G (12:2:2:0), which seems off because 12+2+2+0=16, which fits 4:2:2:0. Wait, no\u2014it should be 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the order is different. Let me double-check:\n\nThe problem states:\n- Pigment color is C, where C is dominant (red)\n- Body color is B, where B is dominant (brown)\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer options directly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Sum 16, but it's different from 9:3:3:1.\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Sum 16, but again different.\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Sum 16, different from our desired 9:3:3:1.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Different.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Different.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Different.\nOption K: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Different.\nOption L: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Different.\nOption M: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as J.\nOption N: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption O: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Q: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Same as G.\nOption R: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption S: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption T: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Same as J.\nOption U: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Same as K.\nOption V: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Same as L.\nOption W: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as M.\nOption X: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Y: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Same as I.\nOption Z: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Same as J.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio according to standard dihybrid crosses is 9:3:3:1, but among the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which may correspond to a different scaling or perhaps a miscalculation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the F1 ratios instead of the F2. Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, which we've determined to be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly match this. The closest is option G (12:2:2:0), which could imply that each class was multiplied by 2, making the ratio 12:2:2:0 instead of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify once again.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and dominant, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. This arises from the fact that each gene has three possible phenotypes, and with two independent genes, the number of phenotypic combinations is 3x3=9, but some phenotypes overlap due to dominance. Wait, no\u2014the actual count is 9:3:3:1 because:\n\n- 9 cases where both dominant (C and B)\n- 3 cases where C dominant and B recessive (C and b)\n- 3 cases where c dominant and B dominant (c and B)\n- 1 case where both recessive (c and b)\n\nYes, that adds up to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options. Wait, looking back, option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but perhaps it's scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is \"12,2,2,0\", which adds to 16, while option A is \"6,2,6,2\" also adding to 16. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of the F1 phenotypes rather than F2, but that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype relative to the others without simplifying the ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2, then express their ratio accordingly. Let me recast the F2 calculation properly.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. When crossed with itself, each gene segregates independently. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-mates, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nThen, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nPigment red (C) and Brown (B) | 25% (from CC BB)\nPigment red (C) and Checkered (b) | 25% (from CC bb)\nPlain (c) and Brown (B) | 25% (from cc BB)\nPlain (c) and Checkered (b) | 25% (from cc bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes now needs to be mapped to specific letters:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options directly match this. However, looking closely, option G (12:2:2:0) suggests that the 9:3:3:1 ratio has been scaled by dividing each term by 0.75 (since 9 \u00f7 1.25 = 7.2, which doesn\u2019t fit). Alternatively, perhaps the options were presented incorrectly. Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, and the closest option is G (12:2:2:0), but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, going back to the question: the options list various ratios. The correct ratio according to my analysis is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none directly match this. However, option G (12:2:2:0) may represent a scenario where the number of each phenotype is doubled, but that doesn't align with the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the F1 phenotypes instead. Let me consider that.\n\nIf the question is asking about the F1 generation, which consists of CcBb, then the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (9/16)\n- Pigment red and Checkered (3/16)\n- Plain and Brown (3/16)\n- Plain and Checkered (1/16)\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, same as before. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which lists 12:2:2:0, suggesting that each category is being counted twice, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider the dominance mapping.\n\nWait, the problem statement defines:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color (red)\n- B is dominant for body color (brown)\n\nThus, the dominance hierarchy is:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are ordered such that:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nWhich corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option G (12:2:2:0), which might be a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that would still be 9:3:3:1, which isn't an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are based on a different assumption. Let me try to compute the phenotypic ratios manually.\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 1/16\n\nTotal: 16 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nComparing with the options, none match exactly. However, option G (12:2:2:0) might be a scaled version, but 12+2+2+0=16, whereas 9+3+3+1=16 as well. However, the ratios aren't proportional. For example, 9:3:3:1 vs. 12:2:2:0, the numbers don't scale uniformly. Similarly, option A (6:2:6:2) adds to 16, but the ratios are different. Option D (1:3:9:3) adds to 16 but is the opposite of what we expect. Option H (5:3:2:6) also adds to 16, but the ratios don't match. Option J (2:6:3:1) adds to 12, which doesn't fit. Option I (7:5:1:3) adds to 16, but the ratios are different. Option K (4:4:4:4) adds to 16, but it's all 4s. Option L (3:9:1:3) adds to 16, but again different. Option M (1:3:9:3) same as J. Option N (5:3:2:6) same as I",

Let's consider the inheritance for each gene separately.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C: 50% (since Cc, dominant)\n- Probability of c: 50% (since Cc)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- Probability of B: 50% (Bb, dominant)\n- Probability of b: 50% (Bb)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1.

But wait, the options given don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, looking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because each bird is either red or brown, and checkered or plain. Wait, no\u2014I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each bird is determined by two independent traits, the number of possible phenotypes is 2^2 = 4. If each outcome is equally likely, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F\n\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E\n\nM. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as D\n\nN. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I\n\nO. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H\n\nWait, my calculation earlier said 1:1:1:1, but the options suggest something else. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's double-check the possible phenotypes:\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): 25%\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): 25%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): 25%\n\nBut according to the options, the sums add up to 16 for A-F, except for J which sums to 12. Wait, but each bird must have one phenotype, so the counts should add to 16 (assuming 8 birds?), but the options don't specify the number of birds. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how many offspring are being considered. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation without considering the actual number of offspring, focusing purely on the ratios. In that case, each phenotype would occur once out of four, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect that. Perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Punnett square isn't complete, or I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous for both genes, meaning both genes are dominant. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. Their F1 would be CC BB \u00d7 cc bb = CcBb. When they self (F2), the possible F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 25% CcBb, 25% ccBB, and 25% ccbb. But the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for each bird, the phenotype would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, B recessive\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 c and B dominant\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 c and B recessive\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options don't have this. Perhaps the options are considering only the checkered vs. plain for each gene, ignoring the pigment color? Wait, no\u2014the question asks specifically about checkered and plain colors, which correspond to the B and b alleles. So the checkered phenotype is when B is recessive (b), and plain is when b is dominant (B). Similarly, red is when C is dominant (C), and brown is when B is dominant (B).\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to match this exact ratio. However, option G states a ratio where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, plain brown is 0. Summing 16, which aligns with the idea that each phenotype is equally represented among 16 individuals. Wait, but that's not accurate\u2014it should be 4 phenotypes each with 4 individuals, totaling 16. So perhaps each phenotype has 4 individuals, but the options don't directly state that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the F1 generation instead of F2, but that seems unlikely because the question specifies \"the F2 generation.\" Another possibility is that the options are considering some other aspect, like the dominance hierarchy beyond simple dominance. But in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, which is straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- 100% chance of having at least one dominant allele (C), leading to red.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- 100% chance of having at least one dominant allele (B), leading to brown.\n\nThus, every bird would have red pigment and brown body color. That contradicts the options given, suggesting that the question expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation in terms of the number of checkered and plain birds, regardless of pigment color. But that wouldn't make sense because the checkered phenotype is determined solely by the B gene, while pigment color is determined by the C gene.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios in terms of the number of checkered and plain birds, irrespective of pigment color. If that's the case, then for each gene:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: BB, Bb, B_B_ (but wait, for the B gene, it's B or b)\n\nWait, but the F2 generation includes both the B and C loci. So the checkered phenotype depends only on the B locus (bb), while the plain phenotype depends on the C locus (BB or Bb). But the question combines both into phenotypic ratios. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes, each appearing 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Instead, option G suggests checkered red (12), checkered brown (2), plain red (2), plain brown (0), which totals 16, matching the idea of four phenotypes each appearing 4 times. This could imply that each phenotype category has an equal count, even though the actual genetic makeup varies. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of birds with checkered versus plain bodies, ignoring pigment color, which would still lead to a 1:1 ratio.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering only the B locus for the checkered vs. plain, and ignores the pigment color, leading to a 1:1 ratio. For example, if we consider the B locus alone, then the checkered (bb) would be half the population, and plain (B_) would also be half, but with pigment color adding another layer, it complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking about the phenotypic distribution of the F2 generation regarding the B locus, ignoring pigment color. That would mean that for the B locus, the possible phenotypes are checkered (bb) and plain (B_), each with 50% probability. Similarly, for the C locus, the phenotypes would be red (CC or Cc) and plain (cc), each with 50% probability. But since the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are 2x2=4 possibilities, each with 25% probability. However, if the question is only considering the B locus's effect on the checkered vs. plain, without considering the pigment color, then the checkered vs. plain ratio would be 1:1, with 50% checkered and 50% plain.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, each 4. But since pigment color is determined by C, which affects the overall phenotype, this may not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the B locus's effect on the checkered vs. plain, and neglecting the C locus's effect on pigment color. That would mean that for the B locus alone, the phenotypes would be 50% checkered and 50% plain. But since pigment color also affects the overall phenotype, the actual phenotypic ratios combine both loci.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the question is asking for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio regarding the B locus, treating the C locus's effect on pigment color as irrelevant. In that case, the checkered vs. plain ratio would be 1:1, with each appearing 50% of the time. Looking at the options, none directly state a 1:1 ratio. However, option F states a 4:4:4:4, implying equal numbers across all four phenotypes. If we consider that the F2 generation's phenotypes are distributed equally, then option F could be correct. Alternatively, if the question is only considering the B locus's effect on checkered vs. plain, ignoring pigment color, then the ratio would be 1:1 for each pair of phenotypes (checkered-red and plain-red, etc.), leading to a 2:2 ratio, which isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is option G, where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. This implies that in the F2 generation, all checkered birds are red (12) and some are brown, while all plain birds are red (2) and some are brown (0), which seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the B locus's effect on the phenotype, and the C locus's effect on pigment color is separate. Therefore, the F2 generation would have 25% for each phenotype combination, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options match this exactly. However, option G sums to 16, which matches the idea of four phenotypes each occurring 4 times, which could indicate that the question is considering the F2 generation's distribution relative to the B locus alone, resulting in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nBut wait, option G's numbers are 12, 2, 2, 0, which adds up to 16, but perhaps it's considering a different grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the F1 generation, but the question specifies F2. This is getting confusing. Based on the calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which accounts for the fact that in the F2 generation, certain phenotypes are more frequent due to the dominance hierarchy. However, my initial analysis shows that each phenotype should occur equally often, so the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Therefore, I might need to reevaluate.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that the B locus determines the color, and the C locus determines pigment color. Therefore, the F2 generation's phenotypes would be determined by the B locus, leading to a 1:1 ratio between checkered and plain, ignoring the pigment color. But since the options don't support this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which assumes that in the F2 generation, the checkered birds are more common than the plain ones, but that doesn't align with standard Mendelian ratios unless there's a different dominance structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the F1 generation rather than the F2, but the question clearly states F2. After careful consideration, I believe the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest approximation is option G, which reflects a 1:1:1:1 distribution, albeit with slight variations in the numbers. Therefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option G as the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 100%\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, in terms of dominance, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the dominant trait. So, for pigment color (C), any presence of C leads to red, regardless of B. Similarly, for B, any presence of B leads to brown.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 requires C and B dominant.\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 requires C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 requires c and B dominant.\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 requires c and B recessive.\n\nNow, the probabilities for each scenario:\n\nSince each parent is homozygous, the F1 is CcBb. Let's consider the inheritance for each gene separately.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C: 50% (since Cc, dominant)\n- Probability of c: 50% (since Cc)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- Probability of B: 50% (Bb, dominant)\n- Probability of b: 50% (Bb)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B: 50% * 50% = 25%\n2. C and b: 50% * 50% = 25%\n3. c and B: 50% * 50% = 25%\n4. c and b: 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nTherefore, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But wait, the options given don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm, looking back at the options:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because each bird is either red or brown, and checkered or plain. Wait, no\u2014I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each bird is determined by two independent traits, the number of possible phenotypes is 2^2 = 4. If each outcome is equally likely, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this exactly.

But since pigment color also affects the overall phenotype, the actual phenotypic ratios combine both loci.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the question is asking for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio regarding the B locus, treating the C locus's effect on pigment color as irrelevant. In that case, the checkered vs. plain ratio would be 1:1, with each appearing 50% of the time. Looking at the options, none directly state a 1:1 ratio. However, option F states a 4:4:4:4, implying equal numbers across all four phenotypes. If we consider that the F2 generation's phenotypes are distributed equally, then option F could be correct. Alternatively, if the question is only considering the B locus's effect on checkered vs. plain, ignoring pigment color, then the ratio would be 1:1 for each pair of phenotypes (checkered-red and plain-red, etc.), leading to a 2:2 ratio, which isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is option G, where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. This implies that in the F2 generation, all checkered birds are red (12) and some are brown, while all plain birds are red (2) and some are brown (0), which seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the B locus's effect on the phenotype, and the C locus's effect on pigment color is separate. Therefore, the F2 generation would have 25% for each phenotype combination, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options match this exactly. However, option G sums to 16, which matches the idea of four phenotypes each occurring 4 times, which could indicate that the question is considering the F2 generation's distribution relative to the B locus alone, resulting in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nBut wait, option G's numbers are 12, 2, 2, 0, which adds up to 16, but perhaps it's considering a different grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the F1 generation, but the question specifies F2. This is getting confusing. Based on the calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which accounts for the fact that in the F2 generation, certain phenotypes are more frequent due to the dominance hierarchy. However, my initial analysis shows that each phenotype should occur equally often, so the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Therefore, I might need to reevaluate.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that the B locus determines the color, and the C locus determines pigment color. Therefore, the F2 generation's phenotypes would be determined by the B locus, leading to a 1:1 ratio between checkered and plain, ignoring the pigment color. But since the options don't support this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which assumes that in the F2 generation, the checkered birds are more common than the plain ones, but that doesn't align with standard Mendelian ratios unless there's a different dominance structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the F1 generation rather than the F2, but the question clearly states F2. After careful consideration, I believe the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest approximation is option G, which reflects a 1:1:1:1 distribution, albeit with slight variations in the numbers. Therefore, despite the confusion, I'll go with option G as the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So for the F2, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.",
    "rollout": " So for the F2, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of having C (dominant, red): 75% (since cc is 25%, and it's recessive)\n- Probability of being c (plain): 25%\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, some phenotypes might combine multiple gene traits. For example, a bird could be red and brown (both C and B dominant) or red and checkered (only C dominant, B recessive), and similarly for plain colors.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nClass 1: Both C and B dominant.\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\n\nClass 2: C dominant, B recessive.\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nClass 3: c dominant, B dominant.\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nClass 4: c dominant, B recessive.\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nWait, but I think I missed something. Because the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which is the same as crossing two F1 plants. So the F2 would have the same four phenotypic classes, each with their respective probabilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nClass 1: 75% \u2192 6.25 units (assuming 100 units)\nClass 2: 18.75% \u2192 18.75 units\nClass 3: 18.75% \u2192 18.75 units\nClass 4: 6.25% \u2192 6.25 units\n\nBut the options given don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 That adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because F2 should have 16 individuals (each plant produces one gamete). Wait, no, the options describe counts, not percentages. So each option lists how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider the number of F2 individuals. Each cross results in four offspring, and with 100% selfing, the F2 population includes all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the actual counts rather than percentages. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe F2 generation arises from a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote (CcBb). The possible F2 phenotypes are based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four phenotypic classes. However, some classes may overlap in terms of phenotypic appearance due to different dominance patterns.\n\nWait, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, each gene contributes independently, so the phenotypes are indeed four distinct classes. Therefore, the expected ratios should add up to 100%.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided several options, including Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Let me verify if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer involves considering dominance. For instance, checkered (c) and plain (C) are one trait, and brown (B) and checkered (b) are another. Thus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): plain red and brown\n2. Checkered (c) and checkered (b): plain red and checkered\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B): checkered brown and brown\n4. Plain (C) and checkered (b): checkered brown and checkered\n\nEach combination has a certain probability based on the Punnett square. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has four possible alleles for each gene, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, considering dominance, some combinations will express the same trait.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant (red), so any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n- c is recessive (plain), so only those with cc will be plain.\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown), so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n- b is recessive (checkered), so only those with bb will be checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Red and Brown: (C)(B) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Red and Checkered: (C)(b) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and Brown: (c)(B) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and Checkered: (c)(b) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, adding up to 16 parts. If we scale this up to 16 birds, we'd have 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. Looking at the options, none directly matches this except perhaps scaled versions.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the options. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inverted from what I calculated, with checkered showing up more often. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the genes.\n\nWait, no. The genes are separate, but the way the options are presented might be based on the interaction. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypes based on the combined effects of both genes. Maybe the checkered (c) and plain (C) interact with brown (B) and black (b).\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the phenotypes based on the expression of both genes. For example, a bird could be:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: (c)(B)\n- Checkered and Black: (c)(b)\n- Plain and Brown: (C)(B)\n- Plain and Black: (C)(b)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: (c)(B)\n2. Checkered and Black: (c)(b)\n3. Plain and Brown: (C)(B)\n4. Plain and Black: (C)(b)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. (c)(B): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n2. (c)(b): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n3. (C)(B): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n4. (C)(b): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 1 : 1, totaling 16. If we scale this to 16 birds, we get 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 1 plain-brown, and 1 plain-black. But the options don't include this exact distribution.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 total, but not matching the 9:3:1:1 ratio.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16, which fits. This corresponds to 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-black. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps the question is asking for the count regardless of the order. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the user provided several options, including G and others. Let me check option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, without considering the specific combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment or at least one dominant in color, it would be considered red and/or brown. But that interpretation isn't standard. Usually, dominance refers to the presence of the allele determining the trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misinterpreting the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Let me reconsider the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" for the F2. But according to my calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which totals 16. The option that sums to 16 is option G: 12+2+2+0=16, but that's different from 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me clarify: in dihybrid crosses, each gene is assumed to be independently assorting. So, for pigment color (C/B), the possible phenotypes are red (C) and plain (c). Similarly, for body color (B/b), the phenotypes are brown (B) and checkered (b). Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nAs before, their probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively. So scaling to 16 birds, it would be 9,3,3,1. But the closest option is G: 12,2,2,0, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the counts without normalization, which would mean 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-black. Looking back at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's close but places the checkered brown at 3 instead of 3, which aligns with my calculation. Hmm, but that doesn't match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question considers the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene separately. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one dominant body allele (B), then it's red and brown. If it has C and b, it's red and checkered, etc. So that's consistent with the previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are listing the counts for each phenotype, but the user has listed them in a different order. Let me list the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nLooking at these, option C matches my calculated 9,3,3,1. However, the user's question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on, adi hybrid cross usually refers to dihybrid cross. But perhaps I misread the question. Let me confirm.\n\nAh! The user wrote: \"adahybridcross\". Wait, \"adihybrid\" might be a typo. In reality, it should be \"dihybrid\" cross. Assuming that, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct count for the four phenotypes would be 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1. So that must be the correct answer. However, the user included \"adiahybridcross\", which is likely a typo and should be \"dihybrid\". So proceeding under that assumption, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So for the F2, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of having C (dominant, red): 75% (since cc is 25%, and it's recessive)\n- Probability of being c (plain): 25%\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, some phenotypes might combine multiple gene traits. For example, a bird could be red and brown (both C and B dominant) or red and checkered (only C dominant, B recessive), and similarly for plain colors.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nClass 1: Both C and B dominant.\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\n\nClass 2: C dominant, B recessive.\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nClass 3: c dominant, B dominant.\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nClass 4: c dominant, B recessive.\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nWait, but I think I missed something. Because the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which is the same as crossing two F1 plants. So the F2 would have the same four phenotypic classes, each with their respective probabilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nClass 1: 75% \u2192 6.25 units (assuming 100 units)\nClass 2: 18.75% \u2192 18.75 units\nClass 3: 18.75% \u2192 18.75 units\nClass 4: 6.25% \u2192 6.25 units\n\nBut the options given don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 That adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because F2 should have 16 individuals (each plant produces one gamete). Wait, no, the options describe counts, not percentages. So each option lists how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider the number of F2 individuals. Each cross results in four offspring, and with 100% selfing, the F2 population includes all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the actual counts rather than percentages. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe F2 generation arises from a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote (CcBb). The possible F2 phenotypes are based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to four phenotypic classes. However, some classes may overlap in terms of phenotypic appearance due to different dominance patterns.\n\nWait, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, each gene contributes independently, so the phenotypes are indeed four distinct classes. Therefore, the expected ratios should add up to 100%.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided several options, including Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Let me verify if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer involves considering dominance. For instance, checkered (c) and plain (C) are one trait, and brown (B) and checkered (b) are another. Thus, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and Brown (B): plain red and brown\n2. Checkered (c) and checkered (b): plain red and checkered\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B): checkered brown and brown\n4. Plain (C) and checkered (b): checkered brown and checkered\n\nEach combination has a certain probability based on the Punnett square. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has four possible alleles for each gene, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, considering dominance, some combinations will express the same trait.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant (red), so any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n- c is recessive (plain), so only those with cc will be plain.\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown), so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n- b is recessive (checkered), so only those with bb will be checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Red and Brown: (C)(B) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Red and Checkered: (C)(b) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and Brown: (c)(B) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and Checkered: (c)(b) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, adding up to 16 parts. If we scale this up to 16 birds, we'd have 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. Looking at the options, none directly matches this except perhaps scaled versions.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the options. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems inverted from what I calculated, with checkered showing up more often. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the genes.\n\nWait, no. The genes are separate, but the way the options are presented might be based on the interaction. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypes based on the combined effects of both genes. Maybe the checkered (c) and plain (C) interact with brown (B) and black (b).\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the phenotypes based on the expression of both genes. For example, a bird could be:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: (c)(B)\n- Checkered and Black: (c)(b)\n- Plain and Brown: (C)(B)\n- Plain and Black: (C)(b)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: (c)(B)\n2. Checkered and Black: (c)(b)\n3. Plain and Brown: (C)(B)\n4. Plain and Black: (C)(b)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. (c)(B): (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n2. (c)(b): (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n3. (C)(B): (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n4. (C)(b): (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 1 : 1, totaling 16. If we scale this to 16 birds, we get 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 1 plain-brown, and 1 plain-black. But the options don't include this exact distribution.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 total, but not matching the 9:3:1:1 ratio.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16, which fits. This corresponds to 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-black. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps the question is asking for the count regardless of the order. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the user provided several options, including G and others. Let me check option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, without considering the specific combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment or at least one dominant in color, it would be considered red and/or brown. But that interpretation isn't standard. Usually, dominance refers to the presence of the allele determining the trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misinterpreting the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Let me reconsider the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" for the F2. But according to my calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which totals 16. The option that sums to 16 is option G: 12+2+2+0=16, but that's different from 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me clarify: in dihybrid crosses, each gene is assumed to be independently assorting. So, for pigment color (C/B), the possible phenotypes are red (C) and plain (c). Similarly, for body color (B/b), the phenotypes are brown (B) and checkered (b). Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nAs before, their probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively. So scaling to 16 birds, it would be 9,3,3,1. But the closest option is G: 12,2,2,0, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the counts without normalization, which would mean 9 red-brown, 3 red-black, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-black. Looking back at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's close but places the checkered brown at 3 instead of 3, which aligns with my calculation. Hmm, but that doesn't match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question considers the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene separately. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and at least one dominant body allele (B), then it's red and brown. If it has C and b, it's red and checkered, etc. So that's consistent with the previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are listing the counts for each phenotype, but the user has listed them in a different order. Let me list the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nLooking at these, option C matches my calculated 9,3,3,1. However, the user's question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on, adi hybrid cross usually refers to dihybrid cross. But perhaps I misread the question. Let me confirm.\n\nAh! The user wrote: \"adahybridcross\". Wait, \"adihybrid\" might be a typo. In reality, it should be \"dihybrid\" cross. Assuming that, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct count for the four phenotypes would be 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1. So that must be the correct answer. However, the user included \"adiahybridcross\", which is likely a typo and should be \"dihybrid\". So proceeding under that assumption, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But given that the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.",
    "rollout": " But given that the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, let me calculate it properly.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. For Gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. For Gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal frequency. When F1 selfs:\n\n- For Gene C: Probability of C = 50%, c = 50%\n- For Gene B: Probability of B = 50%, b = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 3: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, i.e., each phenotype equally likely. Now, translating this into phenotypic counts depends on how many birds are being considered. Since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio without specifying sample size, it's typically represented as 1:1:1:1, but sometimes simplified. Looking back at the options provided, none directly match 1:1:1:1 except option E, which says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16, which seems too large. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (a homozygous dominant checkered red) and cc bb (a homozygous recessive plain brown). The F1 would be CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Then, F1 selfing results in F2 where each gene's alleles are passed on independently. So the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Option B is 8,4,0,4. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option G is 12,2,2,0. Option H is 5,3,2,6. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nHmm, none of these match 1:1:1:1. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: - Checkered (c) is determined by recessive allele.\n- Plain (C) is determined by dominant allele.\n- Brown (B) is determined by dominant allele.\n- Red (b) is determined by recessive allele.\n\nSo, for pigment color: checkered (c) is recessive, plain (C) is dominant. For body color: brown (B) is dominant, checkered (b) is recessive. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C_b_\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 _B_\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 __\n\nNow, considering dominance, the phenotypes would be ordered such that:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_) is the most dominant phenotype.\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_b_) is next.\n- Plain and brown (_B_) is intermediate.\n- Plain and checkered (__ ) is the least.\n\nIn terms of dominance hierarchy, the order is: Pigment red and brown > Pigment red and checkered > Plain and brown > Plain and checkered.\n\nBut when it comes to F2 phenotypic ratios, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio, but since both traits are being expressed together, it's more complex. However, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the individual ratios. For each gene, pigment color (C) and body color (B):\n\n- Pigment red (C) : Pigment plain (c) = 1:1\n- Body brown (B) : Body plain (b) = 1:1\n\nThe overall phenotypic ratio combines these, leading to 9 possible combinations, each with a certain number of individuals. However, some phenotypes may not occur due to blending rather than discrete traits. In this case, since the traits are determined by dominant/recessive alleles, each combination will be observed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All dominant traits (C_B_)\n- 3: C_b_ (pigment red, checkered)\n- 3: _B_ (plain, brown)\n- 1: __ (plain, checkered)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the standard Mendelian ratios. Actually, when two traits are being expressed, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive like that. Instead, it's determined by the interaction of the two independent traits. Each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait is expressed. So, the phenotypic ratio for two traits is indeed 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Both traits dominant (C_B_)\n- 3: Pigment dominant, body recessive (C_b_)\n- 3: Pigment recessive, body dominant (_B_)\n- 1: Both traits recessive (__ )\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Perhaps I need to consider the actual numbers based on the F2 generation. Let's assume that the F2 generation consists of 16 birds (since each F1 is 4, and F2 is 4 x 4 = 16). However, the options don't specify the total number, so we might infer based on the counts. But the user hasn't specified whether the question wants the ratio in terms of parts per hundred or the actual count. Given the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer refers to the ratio of phenotypes, regardless of the total number.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit our previous reasoning. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nGiven that my earlier analysis suggested a 9:3:3:1 ratio, none of the options directly match this unless I'm missing something. Perhaps the question expects a different approach, considering that the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes, while the others are dominant. Wait, checking the dominance hierarchy again: The problem specifies:\n\n- Red (b) is recessive for pigment color (so C is dominant)\n- Brown (B) is dominant for color (so B is dominant)\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, considering dominance, the order is Pigment red and brown > Pigment red and checkered > Plain and brown > Plain and checkered.\n\nIn terms of F2 phenotypic ratios, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio, but since both are expressed together, it's 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes, making it a separate phenotype. Thus, the four phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, Plain and checkered. The F2 ratio would then be 9:3:3:1, but this still doesn't align with any of the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is a separate category, reducing the number of phenotypes. If that's the case, then the four phenotypes could be interpreted differently. But without clear instructions on how the phenotypes are defined beyond dominance, it's challenging. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" but that doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe the user is counting the number of each phenotype regardless of the actual counts. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype (b) is a distinct phenotype, leading to four phenotypes. The F2 generation would then have a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which matches option G. But why?\n\nLet me recalculate. If the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including the recessive ones, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but if the checkered phenotype is a separate category, it might affect the counts. Alternatively, maybe the question is treating the checkered phenotype as a dominant trait, but that contradicts the dominance hierarchy given.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the checkered phenotype is recessive for both genes, hence a separate phenotype. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nEach of these would occur at specific ratios. For pigment color, the dominant (C) is 3/4, recessive (c) is 1/4. For body color, dominant (B) is 3/4, recessive (b) is 1/4. Assuming independence, the combined ratios are:\n\n- C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_b_: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- _B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- __ : (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, if the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is a separate category, the counts might differ. For example, if \"checkered\" is treated as a dominant phenotype, but according to the problem, it's recessive. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. The closest option is E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's inconsistent with the order. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds up to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nIf the question is asking for the number of each phenotype, regardless of the actual counts, perhaps the options are giving the counts without considering the total. But without knowing the total number, it's hard to determine. However, the problem statement mentions \"phenotypic ratio,\" which usually refers to the proportional distribution. Therefore, among the options, none perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E has 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't match. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the inconsistency. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider: the problem states that red is determined by C, which is dominant. Brown is determined by B, which is dominant. Checkered is determined by b, which is recessive. Therefore, the checkered phenotype is recessive for both genes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and brown (_B_)\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. But given that the parents are homozygous for both genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, let me calculate it properly.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. For Gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. For Gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal frequency. When F1 selfs:\n\n- For Gene C: Probability of C = 50%, c = 50%\n- For Gene B: Probability of B = 50%, b = 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 3: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, i.e., each phenotype equally likely. Now, translating this into phenotypic counts depends on how many birds are being considered. Since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio without specifying sample size, it's typically represented as 1:1:1:1, but sometimes simplified. Looking back at the options provided, none directly match 1:1:1:1 except option E, which says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16, which seems too large. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (a homozygous dominant checkered red) and cc bb (a homozygous recessive plain brown). The F1 would be CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Then, F1 selfing results in F2 where each gene's alleles are passed on independently. So the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Option B is 8,4,0,4. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Option G is 12,2,2,0. Option H is 5,3,2,6. Option I is 7,5,1,3. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nHmm, none of these match 1:1:1:1. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: - Checkered (c) is determined by recessive allele.\n- Plain (C) is determined by dominant allele.\n- Brown (B) is determined by dominant allele.\n- Red (b) is determined by recessive allele.\n\nSo, for pigment color: checkered (c) is recessive, plain (C) is dominant. For body color: brown (B) is dominant, checkered (b) is recessive. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C_b_\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 _B_\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 __\n\nNow, considering dominance, the phenotypes would be ordered such that:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_) is the most dominant phenotype.\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_b_) is next.\n- Plain and brown (_B_) is intermediate.\n- Plain and checkered (__ ) is the least.\n\nIn terms of dominance hierarchy, the order is: Pigment red and brown > Pigment red and checkered > Plain and brown > Plain and checkered.\n\nBut when it comes to F2 phenotypic ratios, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio, but since both traits are being expressed together, it's more complex. However, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the individual ratios. For each gene, pigment color (C) and body color (B):\n\n- Pigment red (C) : Pigment plain (c) = 1:1\n- Body brown (B) : Body plain (b) = 1:1\n\nThe overall phenotypic ratio combines these, leading to 9 possible combinations, each with a certain number of individuals. However, some phenotypes may not occur due to blending rather than discrete traits. In this case, since the traits are determined by dominant/recessive alleles, each combination will be observed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All dominant traits (C_B_)\n- 3: C_b_ (pigment red, checkered)\n- 3: _B_ (plain, brown)\n- 1: __ (plain, checkered)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the standard Mendelian ratios. Actually, when two traits are being expressed, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive like that. Instead, it's determined by the interaction of the two independent traits. Each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait is expressed. So, the phenotypic ratio for two traits is indeed 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Both traits dominant (C_B_)\n- 3: Pigment dominant, body recessive (C_b_)\n- 3: Pigment recessive, body dominant (_B_)\n- 1: Both traits recessive (__ )\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Perhaps I need to consider the actual numbers based on the F2 generation. Let's assume that the F2 generation consists of 16 birds (since each F1 is 4, and F2 is 4 x 4 = 16). However, the options don't specify the total number, so we might infer based on the counts. But the user hasn't specified whether the question wants the ratio in terms of parts per hundred or the actual count. Given the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer refers to the ratio of phenotypes, regardless of the total number.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit our previous reasoning. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nGiven that my earlier analysis suggested a 9:3:3:1 ratio, none of the options directly match this unless I'm missing something. Perhaps the question expects a different approach, considering that the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes, while the others are dominant. Wait, checking the dominance hierarchy again: The problem specifies:\n\n- Red (b) is recessive for pigment color (so C is dominant)\n- Brown (B) is dominant for color (so B is dominant)\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, considering dominance, the order is Pigment red and brown > Pigment red and checkered > Plain and brown > Plain and checkered.\n\nIn terms of F2 phenotypic ratios, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio, but since both are expressed together, it's 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided do not reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the checkered phenotype (b) is recessive for both genes, making it a separate phenotype. Thus, the four phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, Plain and checkered. The F2 ratio would then be 9:3:3:1, but this still doesn't align with any of the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is a separate category, reducing the number of phenotypes. If that's the case, then the four phenotypes could be interpreted differently. But without clear instructions on how the phenotypes are defined beyond dominance, it's challenging. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" but that doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe the user is counting the number of each phenotype regardless of the actual counts. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype (b) is a distinct phenotype, leading to four phenotypes. The F2 generation would then have a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which matches option G. But why?\n\nLet me recalculate. If the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including the recessive ones, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but if the checkered phenotype is a separate category, it might affect the counts. Alternatively, maybe the question is treating the checkered phenotype as a dominant trait, but that contradicts the dominance hierarchy given.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the checkered phenotype is recessive for both genes, hence a separate phenotype. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nEach of these would occur at specific ratios. For pigment color, the dominant (C) is 3/4, recessive (c) is 1/4. For body color, dominant (B) is 3/4, recessive (b) is 1/4. Assuming independence, the combined ratios are:\n\n- C_B_: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- C_b_: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- _B_: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- __ : (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, if the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is a separate category, the counts might differ. For example, if \"checkered\" is treated as a dominant phenotype, but according to the problem, it's recessive. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. The closest option is E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's inconsistent with the order. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't fit. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which adds up to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nIf the question is asking for the number of each phenotype, regardless of the actual counts, perhaps the options are giving the counts without considering the total. But without knowing the total number, it's hard to determine. However, the problem statement mentions \"phenotypic ratio,\" which usually refers to the proportional distribution. Therefore, among the options, none perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E has 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which also doesn't match. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the inconsistency. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider: the problem states that red is determined by C, which is dominant. Brown is determined by B, which is dominant. Checkered is determined by b, which is recessive. Therefore, the checkered phenotype is recessive for both genes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and brown (_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (__)\n\nAssuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and independent assortment, the F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, if the checkered phenotype is treated as a dominant phenotype, the counts would change. But according to the problem, it's recessive. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but option E is the closest, albeit reversed.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross (assuming both genes are segregating independently) is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype with both dominant traits (C and B)\n- 3: Phenotype with pigment dominant but body recessive (C and b)\n- 3: Phenotype with pigment recessive but body dominant (c and B)\n- 1: Phenotype with both recessive traits (c and b)\n\nBut wait, in this case, the presence of the dominant alleles results in specific colors. So the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype = Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype = Checkered brown\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype = Plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype = Plain checkered\n\nNow, the actual counts depend on how often each of these combinations occur. In a dihybrid cross, without any assumptions about dominance (which isn't the case here), the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, in our case, the dominance is clear, so the phenotypic ratio would follow this pattern.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming that the cross is between two F1 birds (each F1 being CcBb), the F2 will have a phenotypic distribution as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n- Plain checkered: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches my calculation. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Also, option J has 2:6:3:1, which is different. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Now, going back to the F2 generation. The F2 would be 9 squares in a Punnett square where each gene segregates into three possibilities, but wait, no\u2014since each gene is controlled by a separate locus, the F2 will have 3\u00d73=9 possible phenotypic combinations. But let's calculate them properly.\n\nWait, no, correction: For each gene, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether the dominant allele is present. So for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red)\n- Absence of C (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (brown)\n- Absence of B (checkered)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of each gene independently. Since the genes are linked and assort independently (as per Mendel's laws), we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red): 2/3\n- Probability of c (plain): 1/3\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown): 2/3\n- Probability of b (checkered): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 4\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2\n3. Plain and brown: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2\n4. Plain and checkered: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation would be 4:2:2:1. Adding up, 4+2+2+1=9, which makes sense because the F2 population would be 9 birds. But looking at the options given, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.1,4,4,4\n\nL.4,4,4,4 (Wait, option F and K are similar.)\n\nBut according to my calculation, the phenotypic distribution is 4:2:2:1, which isn't exactly listed. However, looking at option F, which states 4,4,4,4, implying equal distribution, but our calculation shows it's not. Option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't align either. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another possibility arises: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., when c and b are both present. That would mean the phenotype is \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" If that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9\n\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/9\n\nWhich still adds up to 9 parts. None of the options match this except perhaps option F, which suggests equal distribution, but that might not be accurate unless there's some error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the number of each phenotype regardless of the dominance hierarchy, treating each as equally probable. In that case, each bird could have any phenotype, leading to 9 birds, each being one of the four types. But without specific dominance probabilities, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem considers that the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., c and b, making the phenotype \"checkered,\" while the others remain as they are. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b recessive)\n\nThe probabilities would then be:\n\n1. C and B: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C and b: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. c and B: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. c and b: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options A to L directly reflect this, but looking back, option J says 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which contradicts the 9 total birds. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong about how the checkered phenotype is expressed. Perhaps the checkered phenotype is only when both genes are recessive, making the bird appear entirely plain, and the other phenotypes include red and/or brown. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain (only c and b recessive)\n\nSo the probabilities would be:\n\n1. C and B: (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. C and b: (2/3)(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. c and B: (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. c and b: (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 1\n\nAgain, same ratio of 4:2:2:1. Still, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option K says 1,4,4,4, which also doesn't fit. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which implies equal distribution, which might not be the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts all birds as having four possible phenotypes, including those where one trait is absent. If that's the case, then the distribution would indeed be 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume equal likelihood for each phenotype, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would correspond to option F. But that seems unlikely, especially since the checkered phenotype is specifically defined by both recessive alleles.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the recessive ones. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele is considered red or brown. The checkered phenotype would only occur when both alleles are recessive. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain: c and b \u2192 1/9\n\nSame as before. So the answer shouldn't be matching any exact option, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try to recalculate the F2 generation.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Each parent contributes one allele. So for each gene, the gametes are determined by the parent's alleles.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes (C from CC, B from BB)\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes (c from cc, b from bb)\n\nTherefore, F1: CcBb\n\nF2: Each F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions because each parent contributes one allele randomly. So F2 would consist of four types of gametes:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CB\n\n- From CB + cb: cb\n\n- From cb + CB: cb\n\n- From cb + cb: cb\n\nWait, no, actually, the F2 would be formed by the random combination of gametes from F1. Since F1 produces CB and cb in equal frequency, the F2 would have gametes:\n\n- CB: 25%\n\n- cb: 75% (because half of the time, a CB gamete combines with a cb, giving cb; the other half, two cb gametes combine, giving cb twice, but in reality, the probabilities would average out).\n\nWait, no, let's do it properly. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gene segregates independently. For the C locus:\n\n- C: dominant (red) \u2192 2/3 chance\n\n- c: recessive (plain) \u2192 1/3 chance\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B: dominant (brown) \u2192 2/3 chance\n\n- b: recessive (checkered) \u2192 1/3 chance\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nRed and Brown: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\n\nRed and Checkered: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n\nPlain and Brown: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n\nPlain and Checkered: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nAdding these up gives 4+2+2+1=9, which matches the total number of F2 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match this exactly. However, option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which assumes equal distribution. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which totals 16, which is impossible because there are only 9 birds. Option H is different. Option I is different as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the checkered phenotype. If the checkered phenotype is only when both alleles are recessive (i.e., c and b), then the phenotype would be \"plain,\" and the rest would include red and/or brown. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain (only c and b) \u2192 1/9\n\nAgain, same ratio of 4:2:2:1. Given that, none of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps I overlooked something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which is too high. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply 4 birds of each phenotype, totaling 16, which is impossible. Option K is 1,4,4,4, which also totals 10. Option L is 4,4,4,4, same as F. Option M is 4,4,4,4, same as F.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Maybe I'm supposed to count the number of each phenotype, regardless of dominance. If that's the case, then 4,4,4,4 would mean four birds of each phenotype, totaling 16, which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count per phenotype, irrespective of the actual ratio. In that case, option J has 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, which is less than 9. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is not counted at all, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, rather than the ratio. For example, if there are 9 F2 birds, each producing a certain number of each phenotype. But the way the question is phrased, it asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the count per phenotype over the total.\n\nGiven that, perhaps none of the options match exactly, but based on standard Punnett square results, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Among the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit, but perhaps I missed a step.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the number of each type of trait regardless of dominance. For instance, if a bird is checkered, it doesn't express the brown or red coloration\u2014it's purely checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option J if I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance hierarchies, leading to equal representation, hence option F.\n\nHowever, given the calculations, I believe the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to option J if I'm misunderstanding the dominance levels, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the count of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would be option F.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the checkered phenotype is a distinct trait, so it's better to stick with the actual probabilities. Without further options matching 4:2:2:1, perhaps the closest is option J, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, leading to 9 birds, each with a specific phenotype. The options provided don't include 4:2:2:1, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype as follows:\n\nIf a bird is checkered (both recessives), it's counted under the 'plain' category. Otherwise, it's counted as pigmented. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. Pigment red and plain: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. Plain and plain: 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nStill 4:2:2:1. Without a matching option, perhaps the intended answer is option J, despite it not matching the exact ratio, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.\n\nAfter reevaluating, I think the correct answer is option J: phenotypic ratio 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't add up to 12. Alternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when the bird is purely plain (no pigment), regardless of color. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and plain: C dominant, b \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain and plain: c and b \u2192 1/9\n\nWhich again brings us to 4:2:2:1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to 1:1:1:1, which would be option F.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing, I think the correct answer is option J, even though it doesn't strictly follow the probabilities, but perhaps due to a misinterpretation of the checkered phenotype.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Now, going back to the F2 generation. The F2 would be 9 squares in a Punnett square where each gene segregates into three possibilities, but wait, no\u2014since each gene is controlled by a separate locus, the F2 will have 3\u00d73=9 possible phenotypic combinations. But let's calculate them properly.\n\nWait, no, correction: For each gene, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether the dominant allele is present. So for the C locus:\n\n- Presence of C (red)\n- Absence of C (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Presence of B (brown)\n- Absence of B (checkered)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of each gene independently. Since the genes are linked and assort independently (as per Mendel's laws), we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red): 2/3\n- Probability of c (plain): 1/3\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown): 2/3\n- Probability of b (checkered): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2192 4\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2\n3. Plain and brown: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2192 2\n4. Plain and checkered: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation would be 4:2:2:1. Adding up, 4+2+2+1=9, which makes sense because the F2 population would be 9 birds. But looking at the options given, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.1,4,4,4\n\nL.4,4,4,4 (Wait, option F and K are similar.)\n\nBut according to my calculation, the phenotypic distribution is 4:2:2:1, which isn't exactly listed. However, looking at option F, which states 4,4,4,4, implying equal distribution, but our calculation shows it's not. Option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't align either. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another possibility arises: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., when c and b are both present. That would mean the phenotype is \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" If that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9\n\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/9\n\nWhich still adds up to 9 parts. None of the options match this except perhaps option F, which suggests equal distribution, but that might not be accurate unless there's some error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the number of each phenotype regardless of the dominance hierarchy, treating each as equally probable. In that case, each bird could have any phenotype, leading to 9 birds, each being one of the four types. But without specific dominance probabilities, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem considers that the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, i.e., c and b, making the phenotype \"checkered,\" while the others remain as they are. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b recessive)\n\nThe probabilities would then be:\n\n1. C and B: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n2. C and b: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n3. c and B: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n4. c and b: (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options A to L directly reflect this, but looking back, option J says 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which contradicts the 9 total birds. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong about how the checkered phenotype is expressed. Perhaps the checkered phenotype is only when both genes are recessive, making the bird appear entirely plain, and the other phenotypes include red and/or brown. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain (only c and b recessive)\n\nSo the probabilities would be:\n\n1. C and B: (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. C and b: (2/3)(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. c and B: (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. c and b: (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 1\n\nAgain, same ratio of 4:2:2:1. Still, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option K says 1,4,4,4, which also doesn't fit. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which implies equal distribution, which might not be the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts all birds as having four possible phenotypes, including those where one trait is absent. If that's the case, then the distribution would indeed be 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume equal likelihood for each phenotype, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would correspond to option F. But that seems unlikely, especially since the checkered phenotype is specifically defined by both recessive alleles.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the recessive ones. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele is considered red or brown. The checkered phenotype would only occur when both alleles are recessive. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain: c and b \u2192 1/9\n\nSame as before. So the answer shouldn't be matching any exact option, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try to recalculate the F2 generation.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Each parent contributes one allele. So for each gene, the gametes are determined by the parent's alleles.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes (C from CC, B from BB)\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes (c from cc, b from bb)\n\nTherefore, F1: CcBb\n\nF2: Each F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions because each parent contributes one allele randomly. So F2 would consist of four types of gametes:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CB\n\n- From CB + cb: cb\n\n- From cb + CB: cb\n\n- From cb + cb: cb\n\nWait, no, actually, the F2 would be formed by the random combination of gametes from F1. Since F1 produces CB and cb in equal frequency, the F2 would have gametes:\n\n- CB: 25%\n\n- cb: 75% (because half of the time, a CB gamete combines with a cb, giving cb; the other half, two cb gametes combine, giving cb twice, but in reality, the probabilities would average out).\n\nWait, no, let's do it properly. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gene segregates independently. For the C locus:\n\n- C: dominant (red) \u2192 2/3 chance\n\n- c: recessive (plain) \u2192 1/3 chance\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B: dominant (brown) \u2192 2/3 chance\n\n- b: recessive (checkered) \u2192 1/3 chance\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nRed and Brown: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\n\nRed and Checkered: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\n\nPlain and Brown: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\n\nPlain and Checkered: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nAdding these up gives 4+2+2+1=9, which matches the total number of F2 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. But looking at the options, none seem to match this exactly. However, option J says 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which assumes equal distribution. Option G says 12,2,2,0, which totals 16, which is impossible because there are only 9 birds. Option H is different. Option I is different as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the checkered phenotype. If the checkered phenotype is only when both alleles are recessive (i.e., c and b), then the phenotype would be \"plain,\" and the rest would include red and/or brown. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain (only c and b) \u2192 1/9\n\nAgain, same ratio of 4:2:2:1. Given that, none of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps I overlooked something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which is too high. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply 4 birds of each phenotype, totaling 16, which is impossible. Option K is 1,4,4,4, which also totals 10. Option L is 4,4,4,4, same as F. Option M is 4,4,4,4, same as F.\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Maybe I'm supposed to count the number of each phenotype, regardless of dominance. If that's the case, then 4,4,4,4 would mean four birds of each phenotype, totaling 16, which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count per phenotype, irrespective of the actual ratio. In that case, option J has 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, which is less than 9. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is not counted at all, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, rather than the ratio. For example, if there are 9 F2 birds, each producing a certain number of each phenotype. But the way the question is phrased, it asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the count per phenotype over the total.\n\nGiven that, perhaps none of the options match exactly, but based on standard Punnett square results, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Among the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit, but perhaps I missed a step.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the number of each type of trait regardless of dominance. For instance, if a bird is checkered, it doesn't express the brown or red coloration\u2014it's purely checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option J if I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype without considering dominance hierarchies, leading to equal representation, hence option F.\n\nHowever, given the calculations, I believe the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to option J if I'm misunderstanding the dominance levels, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the count of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which would be option F.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the checkered phenotype is a distinct trait, so it's better to stick with the actual probabilities. Without further options matching 4:2:2:1, perhaps the closest is option J, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, leading to 9 birds, each with a specific phenotype. The options provided don't include 4:2:2:1, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype as follows:\n\nIf a bird is checkered (both recessives), it's counted under the 'plain' category. Otherwise, it's counted as pigmented. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 4/9 \u2192 4\n\n2. Pigment red and plain: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n3. Plain and brown: 2/9 \u2192 2\n\n4. Plain and plain: 1/9 \u2192 1\n\nStill 4:2:2:1. Without a matching option, perhaps the intended answer is option J, despite it not matching the exact ratio, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.\n\nAfter reevaluating, I think the correct answer is option J: phenotypic ratio 2,6,3,1, but that doesn't add up to 12. Alternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when the bird is purely plain (no pigment), regardless of color. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 4/9\n\n2. Pigment red and plain: C dominant, b \u2192 2/9\n\n3. Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 2/9\n\n4. Plain and plain: c and b \u2192 1/9\n\nWhich again brings us to 4:2:2:1. Since none of the options match this, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to 1:1:1:1, which would be option F.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing, I think the correct answer is option J, even though it doesn't strictly follow the probabilities, but perhaps due to a misinterpretation of the checkered phenotype.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

    "rollout": " Given that each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nWait, but let me approach this differently. Each bird has two independent traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n- Plain and brown (c_B_)\n- Plain and checkered (c_bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each trait are:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, and the bird must have at least one C allele)\n- P(c) = 1/4\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- P(B) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nWait, but let me approach this differently. Each bird has two independent traits: pigment and body color. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n- Plain and brown (c_B_)\n- Plain and checkered (c_bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each trait are:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since C is dominant, and the bird must have at least one C allele)\n- P(c) = 1/4\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- P(B) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: P(C) * P(b) = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: P(c) * P(B) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: P(c) * P(b) = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",

C_ and bb (no B, so brown becomes checkered?) Wait no, if B is recessive (b), then the bird's body color is checkered, regardless of B. Similarly, if C is recessive, the bird's pigment is plain.

Wait, no\u2014if a bird is c_ and B_, it's still considered as having C_ and B_, so the phenotype would be Checkered red. Similarly, c_ and bb would be Plain red. C_ and bb would be Plain red, and c_ and B_ would be Checkered red. Wait, that might mean that some phenotypes could overlap in terms of presence, but the actual phenotypes are distinct based on the combination.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probabilities. The probability of a bird being C_ (p) is 3/4, and B_ (q) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both C_ and B_ is p * q = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of C_ and bb is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. The probability of c_ and B_ is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16, and c_ and bb is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- C_ and bb: Plain red (phenotype 2)\n- c_ and B_: Plain red (phenotype 3)\n- c_ and bb: Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes are overlapping. For instance, C_ and B_ and c_ and B_ both have B_ trait, leading to the same phenotype. Similarly, C_ and bb and c_ and bb both have c_ trait, leading to the same phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be grouped as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Plain red (either C_ and bb or c_ and B_)\n3. Plain brown (c_ and bb)\n4. Checkered brown (which isn't possible because if B_ is absent, the body color is checkered, but the pigment remains plain.)\n\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B and b. So if B_ is present, the body color is brown; if b_ is present, it's checkered. Pigment color is determined by C and c. So if both C_ and B_ are present, the bird is Checkered red. If C_ and bb, then Pigmented red (but body color is checkered). If c_ and B_, then Plain red (body color brown). If c_ and bb, then Plain brown (body color checkered).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Plain red (C_ and bb)\n3. Plain brown (c_ and bb)\n4. Checkered brown (c_ and B_)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each with different combinations. Now, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ and B_): 9/16\n- Plain red (C_ and bb): 3/16\n- Plain brown (c_ and bb): 1/16\n- Checkered brown (c_ and B_): 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+1+3=16, which checks out.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. So for each gene, the probability of presence is p = 3/4 (since dominant C is 3/4) and absence is q = 1/4. But since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Wait, but for each gene, the chance of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio would involve considering the combinations where either C is present OR B is present, but actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait. So the phenotypic ratio depends on whether each gene is present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain red and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain red and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nSo for pigment color (C):\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSince both genes determine the phenotype, the bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present AND B is present. Because if either C or B is missing, the bird doesn't exhibit that trait. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_ and bb (no B, so brown becomes checkered?) Wait no, if B is recessive (b), then the bird's body color is checkered, regardless of B. Similarly, if C is recessive, the bird's pigment is plain. So the phenotype depends on the combination of the two traits.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n- C_ and B_: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_ and bb (no B, so brown becomes checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- c_ and B_: Pigment plain (c) and Brown \u2192 Plain red\n- c_ and bb (no B) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypic categories. However, some may overlap. For example, if a bird is c_ and B_, that would be checkered red. Similarly, c_ and bb would be plain red. C_ and B_ is separate from c_ and B_. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is c_ and B_, it's still considered as having C_ and B_, so the phenotype would be Checkered red. Similarly, c_ and bb would be Plain red. C_ and bb would be Plain red, and c_ and B_ would be Checkered red. Wait, that might mean that some phenotypes could overlap in terms of presence, but the actual phenotypes are distinct based on the combination.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probabilities. The probability of a bird being C_ (p) is 3/4, and B_ (q) is also 3/4. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both C_ and B_ is p * q = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, the probability of C_ and bb is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. The probability of c_ and B_ is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16, and c_ and bb is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- C_ and bb: Plain red (phenotype 2)\n- c_ and B_: Plain red (phenotype 3)\n- c_ and bb: Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes are overlapping. For instance, C_ and B_ and c_ and B_ both have B_ trait, leading to the same phenotype. Similarly, C_ and bb and c_ and bb both have c_ trait, leading to the same phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be grouped as follows:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Plain red (either C_ and bb or c_ and B_)\n3. Plain brown (c_ and bb)\n4. Checkered brown (which isn't possible because if B_ is absent, the body color is checkered, but the pigment remains plain.)\n\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B and b. So if B_ is present, the body color is brown; if b_ is present, it's checkered. Pigment color is determined by C and c. So if both C_ and B_ are present, the bird is Checkered red. If C_ and bb, then Pigmented red (but body color is checkered). If c_ and B_, then Plain red (body color brown). If c_ and bb, then Plain brown (body color checkered).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n2. Plain red (C_ and bb)\n3. Plain brown (c_ and bb)\n4. Checkered brown (c_ and B_)\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, each with different combinations. Now, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ and B_): 9/16\n- Plain red (C_ and bb): 3/16\n- Plain brown (c_ and bb): 1/16\n- Checkered brown (c_ and B_): 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+1+3=16, which checks out. Now, converting these fractions into ratios: 9 : 3 : 1 : 3.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16? 6+2+6+2=16, yes.

However, since each bird must express both traits, the actual phenotypes are combinations where both traits are expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2.

However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the others, we can consider them separately. But wait, the presence of one trait affects the overall phenotype, so the probabilities aren't simply additive. Instead, we can use a Punnett square approach, but since the question provides a specific setup, perhaps it's better to directly compute the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to recognize that each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B alleles. So, the possible phenotypes can be determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Let's list all possible combinations and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nPossible genotype combinations for each bird (assuming F2):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4.

For example, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This suggests that plain-red might not be a phenotype because the dominant allele for pigment (C) results in red, not plain. Similarly, checkered could refer to the B locus, but the question uses 'checkered' as the recessive allele for B. Wait, the question defines 'checkered' as the recessive allele for B, so checkered would be bb. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are four: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the selfing of CcBb. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Body brown (B_)\n  - Phenotype: red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Body checkered (bb)\n  - Phenotype: red-checkered\n- cc: Plain (cc), Body brown (B_)\n  - Phenotype: plain-brown\n- cc: Plain, Body checkered (bb)\n  - Phenotype: plain-checkered\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. Assuming random assortment, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc: 2*(1/2)(1/2) = 1/2\n- cc: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nEach of these genotypes corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, let's count how many times each phenotype appears in the F2 population. \n\n- Red-brown (CC): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc): 50%\n- Plain-brown (cc): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc): 25%\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 generation includes all four phenotypes. Now, looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows that plain-brown and plain-checkered should each be 25% of the population, not 3%. Option A: 6,2,2,6 (which adds up to 16). Option B: 8,4,0,4 (sum 16). Option C: 9,3,3,1 (sum 16). Option G: 12,2,2,0 (sum 16). Option H: 5,3,2,6 (sum 16). Option J: 2,6,3,1 (sum 12). Option I: 7,5,1,3 (sum 16).\n\nOur calculations suggest that the phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1:2, which translates to 4 parts: 1 red-brown, 2 red-checkered, 1 plain-brown, 2 plain-checkered. But none of the options perfectly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Also, the options are labeled from A to J, each providing different ratios.\n\nLet me recast the problem without focusing on the F2 yet. Perhaps the question expects us to calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios directly from the F1 generation, considering that F1 is CcBb.\n\nIn the F1, each bird is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 generation will include all possible combinations. As previously determined, the F2 phenotypes are based on the F1's genotypes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown (CC/B_): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc/B_): 25%\n- Plain-brown (cc/B_): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc/bb): 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur equally, i.e., 25% each. However, the sum of the options given does not add up to 100%, indicating that some phenotypes may not be observed. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Sum is 16. If each phenotype were 1/4, then across 16 birds, each would appear 4 times, but option D suggests 1,3,9,3\u2014which sums to 16. This implies that red-brown is less frequent than expected, red-checkered is even less frequent, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something earlier. Let me think again. Maybe the question refers to the F1 rather than F2? No, the question clearly states F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that only certain phenotypes are expressed based on dominance. But in reality, dominance dictates whether the trait is expressed, regardless of the parent's genotype. So, if a bird is Cc, it expresses the dominant pigment color, regardless of its B status.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be 25% each. But the options provided do not reflect this. Let me look at option D again: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would imply that checkered red (which isn't a real phenotype) is present 1 time, checkered brown 3 times, etc. But the question likely refers to the actual observable phenotypes, which are red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, and plain-checkered.\n\nIf we assume that each of these four phenotypes occurs equally in the F2 generation, then each would account for 25% of the population. However, the sum of the options provided in the answer choices varies. The only option that reflects a 1:3:9:9 ratio is option D, but that's not matching our expectation of equal distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: In genetics, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the expression of the associated trait. So, for pigment color (C), any bird with at least one C allele will display the pigment color, while a plain bird (cc) will have no pigment. Similarly, for body color (B), any bird with at least one B allele will display the brown color, while a plain bird (bb) will have brown eyes (or whatever), depending on context. However, the term \"checkered\" refers specifically to the recessive state of the B locus, which is expressed when both alleles are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nAssuming the F2 generation follows Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype would have a frequency of 25%. Thus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not reflect this. The closest is option D, which has a 1:3:9:9 ratio, suggesting unequal distribution. But why would the distribution be unequal?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let's reconsider. F1 is CcBb. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The F2 would then be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent can produce CB or cb gametes, leading to F2 genotypes as:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F2 genotypes are the combinations of the gametes. The correct way is:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown (C_, B_)\n- Cc: red-checkered (C_, bb)\n- cc: plain-brown (cc, B_)\n- cc: plain-checkered (cc, bb)\n\nNow, considering the F2 population, the number of each phenotype would be proportional to their frequency. So:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 50% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n- 25% plain-checkered\n\nThis would mean that red-brown and plain-brown would each make up half of the F2 population, whereas red-checkered and plain-checkered would make up a quarter each. However, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Let's check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would correspond to a 1:3:9:9 ratio, implying that the frequencies are 1 part, 3 parts, 9 parts, 9 parts. To get a sum of 16 parts, each part equals 1 unit. So, 1:3:9:9. How does this relate to our previous calculation?\n\nOur calculation suggested a 1:2:1:2 ratio (25%,50%,25%,25%) for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. None of the options match this. However, if the question mistakenly referred to F1 phenotypes instead of F2, let's see what happens.\n\nF1 is CcBb. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nNow, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown (C_, B_)\n- Cc: red-checkered (C_, bb)\n- cc: plain-brown (cc, B_)\n- cc: plain-checkered (cc, bb)\n\nFrequency-wise, the same as before: 25% each.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes. In that case, the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CcBb: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- CcBb: C_ and bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CcBb: cc and B_ \u2192 plain-brown\n- CcBb: cc and bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the F1 phenotypes would be 100% red-brown, 0% red-checkered, 0% plain-brown, 0% plain-checkered. But this contradicts the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio, considering the presence of both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown\n- Cc: red-checkered\n- cc: plain-brown\n- cc: plain-checkered\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, translating to 25% each. However, the options provided do not reflect this. The closest option is D, which has a 1:3:9:9 ratio, suggesting unequal distribution. But my calculations don't support this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypes, but that would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\". Checkered refers to the recessive allele for B, meaning bb. Plain refers to the dominant allele for B, meaning B_. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird's genotype is as follows:\n\n- CC: red-brown\n- Cc: red-checkered\n- cc: plain-brown\n- cc: plain-checkered\n\nThus, the F2 population would have:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 25% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n- 25% plain-checkered\n\nWhich would translate to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. If each phenotype occurred 4 times, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But option D suggests a much higher prevalence of plain-brown and plain-checkered. Perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes instead, but that would not align with the options provided.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, which would lead to the phenotypes being:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nAnd the F2 generation would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the F2 generation's distribution based on the parents' F1 cross. Let me clarify:\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me approach this differently. For each gene:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - C_: presence \u2192 red\n  - cc: absence \u2192 plain\n  \n- For the body (B):\n  - B_: presence \u2192 brown\n  - bb: absence \u2192 checkered\n\nSince each gene is independent, the combined phenotype will follow the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. However, since each bird must express both traits, the actual phenotypes are combinations where both traits are expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. C_ and bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. cc and B_ \u2192 plain-brown\n4. cc and bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the pigment (C):\n\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4 (since CC and Cc are 3/4)\n- Probability of cc = 1/4\n\nFor the body (B):\n\n- Probability of B_ = 3/4\n- Probability of bb = 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the respective probabilities for each gene. However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the others, we can consider them separately. But wait, the presence of one trait affects the overall phenotype, so the probabilities aren't simply additive. Instead, we can use a Punnett square approach, but since the question provides a specific setup, perhaps it's better to directly compute the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to recognize that each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B alleles. So, the possible phenotypes can be determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Let's list all possible combinations and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nPossible genotype combinations for each bird (assuming F2):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but according to the given options, some phenotypes don't exist. For example, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This suggests that plain-red might not be a phenotype because the dominant allele for pigment (C) results in red, not plain. Similarly, checkered could refer to the B locus, but the question uses 'checkered' as the recessive allele for B. Wait, the question defines 'checkered' as the recessive allele for B, so checkered would be bb. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are four: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the selfing of CcBb. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Body brown (B_)\n  - Phenotype: red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Body checkered (bb)\n  - Phenotype: red-checkered\n- cc: Plain (cc), Body brown (B_)\n  - Phenotype: plain-brown\n- cc: Plain, Body checkered (bb)\n  - Phenotype: plain-checkered\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. Assuming random assortment, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc: 2*(1/2)(1/2) = 1/2\n- cc: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nEach of these genotypes corresponds to a specific phenotype. Now, let's count how many times each phenotype appears in the F2 population. \n\n- Red-brown (CC): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc): 50%\n- Plain-brown (cc): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc): 25%\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 generation includes all four phenotypes. Now, looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows that plain-brown and plain-checkered should each be 25% of the population, not 3%. Option A: 6,2,2,6 (which adds up to 16). Option B: 8,4,0,4 (sum 16). Option C: 9,3,3,1 (sum 16). Option G: 12,2,2,0 (sum 16). Option H: 5,3,2,6 (sum 16). Option J: 2,6,3,1 (sum 12). Option I: 7,5,1,3 (sum 16).\n\nOur calculations suggest that the phenotypic ratio should be 1:2:1:2, which translates to 4 parts: 1 red-brown, 2 red-checkered, 1 plain-brown, 2 plain-checkered. But none of the options perfectly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Also, the options are labeled from A to J, each providing different ratios.\n\nLet me recast the problem without focusing on the F2 yet. Perhaps the question expects us to calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios directly from the F1 generation, considering that F1 is CcBb.\n\nIn the F1, each bird is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 generation will include all possible combinations. As previously determined, the F2 phenotypes are based on the F1's genotypes. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red-brown (CC/B_): 25%\n- Red-checkered (Cc/B_): 25%\n- Plain-brown (cc/B_): 25%\n- Plain-checkered (cc/bb): 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur equally, i.e., 25% each. However, the sum of the options given does not add up to 100%, indicating that some phenotypes may not be observed. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Sum is 16. If each phenotype were 1/4, then across 16 birds, each would appear 4 times, but option D suggests 1,3,9,3\u2014which sums to 16. This implies that red-brown is less frequent than expected, red-checkered is even less frequent, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something earlier. Let me think again. Maybe the question refers to the F1 rather than F2? No, the question clearly states F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that only certain phenotypes are expressed based on dominance. But in reality, dominance dictates whether the trait is expressed, regardless of the parent's genotype. So, if a bird is Cc, it expresses the dominant pigment color, regardless of its B status.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be 25% each. But the options provided do not reflect this. Let me look at option D again: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would imply that checkered red (which isn't a real phenotype) is present 1 time, checkered brown 3 times, etc. But the question likely refers to the actual observable phenotypes, which are red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, and plain-checkered.\n\nIf we assume that each of these four phenotypes occurs equally in the F2 generation, then each would account for 25% of the population. However, the sum of the options provided in the answer choices varies. The only option that reflects a 1:3:9:9 ratio is option D, but that's not matching our expectation of equal distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: In genetics, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the expression of the associated trait. So, for pigment color (C), any bird with at least one C allele will display the pigment color, while a plain bird (cc) will have no pigment. Similarly, for body color (B), any bird with at least one B allele will display the brown color, while a plain bird (bb) will have brown eyes (or whatever), depending on context. However, the term \"checkered\" refers specifically to the recessive state of the B locus, which is expressed when both alleles are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nAssuming the F2 generation follows Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype would have a frequency of 25%. Thus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not reflect this. The closest is option D, which has a 1:3:9:9 ratio, suggesting unequal distribution. But why would the distribution be unequal?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. Let's reconsider. F1 is CcBb. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The F2 would then be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent can produce CB or cb gametes, leading to F2 genotypes as:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F2 genotypes are the combinations of the gametes. The correct way is:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown (C_, B_)\n- Cc: red-checkered (C_, bb)\n- cc: plain-brown (cc, B_)\n- cc: plain-checkered (cc, bb)\n\nNow, considering the F2 population, the number of each phenotype would be proportional to their frequency. So:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 50% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n- 25% plain-checkered\n\nThis would mean that red-brown and plain-brown would each make up half of the F2 population, whereas red-checkered and plain-checkered would make up a quarter each. However, the options provided do not include such a ratio. Let's check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would correspond to a 1:3:9:9 ratio, implying that the frequencies are 1 part, 3 parts, 9 parts, 9 parts. To get a sum of 16 parts, each part equals 1 unit. So, 1:3:9:9. How does this relate to our previous calculation?\n\nOur calculation suggested a 1:2:1:2 ratio (25%,50%,25%,25%) for red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered respectively. None of the options match this. However, if the question mistakenly referred to F1 phenotypes instead of F2, let's see what happens.\n\nF1 is CcBb. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nNow, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown (C_, B_)\n- Cc: red-checkered (C_, bb)\n- cc: plain-brown (cc, B_)\n- cc: plain-checkered (cc, bb)\n\nFrequency-wise, the same as before: 25% each.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes. In that case, the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CcBb: C_ (pigment red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- CcBb: C_ and bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CcBb: cc and B_ \u2192 plain-brown\n- CcBb: cc and bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the F1 phenotypes would be 100% red-brown, 0% red-checkered, 0% plain-brown, 0% plain-checkered. But this contradicts the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio, considering the presence of both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-brown\n- Cc: red-checkered\n- cc: plain-brown\n- cc: plain-checkered\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, translating to 25% each. However, the options provided do not reflect this. The closest option is D, which has a 1:3:9:9 ratio, suggesting unequal distribution. But my calculations don't support this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypes, but that would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\". Checkered refers to the recessive allele for B, meaning bb. Plain refers to the dominant allele for B, meaning B_. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird's genotype is as follows:\n\n- CC: red-brown\n- Cc: red-checkered\n- cc: plain-brown\n- cc: plain-checkered\n\nThus, the F2 population would have:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 25% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n- 25% plain-checkered\n\nWhich would translate to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. If each phenotype occurred 4 times, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But option D suggests a much higher prevalence of plain-brown and plain-checkered. Perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 phenotypes instead, but that would not align with the options provided.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance, which would lead to the phenotypes being:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb): red-checkered\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_): plain-brown\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb): plain-checkered\n\nAnd the F2 generation would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the F2 generation's distribution based on the parents' F1 cross. Let me clarify:\n\nParental cross is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. The F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let me consider each gene separately:",
    "rollout": " Let me consider each gene separately:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% CC (C dominant \u2192 red)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant \u2192 red)\n- 25% cc (c recessive \u2192 plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for the C locus alone. Similarly, for the B gene:\n- 25% BB (B dominant \u2192 brown)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant \u2192 brown)\n- 25% bb (b recessive \u2192 checkered)\n\nBut since the two genes are linked (as indicated by the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c\"), the inheritance of the two genes might not be independent, but I don't think the user specified linkage, so perhaps they assume independent assortment. Anyway, proceeding under the assumption that the genes assort independently.\n\nSo the combined phenotypic ratios would be determined by multiplying the individual ratios. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype type:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n- Plain and brown: (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Plain and checkered: (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums up to 25%, which seems off because each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio. Actually, no\u2014if each gene is in a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), then combining them would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to model it as 25% for each possible combination of the two traits, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene has three phenotypic categories, but in reality, each gene is expressed as a dominant or recessive trait. So for two independent traits, the number of phenotypic classes is 2x2=4. Each class corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each of the four possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, or 1/4 each. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2, suggesting a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, but how does that align?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe checkered pattern is determined by gene C, which is dominant. So checkered (c) is the recessive. The color is determined by gene B: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). The problem mentions that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Wait, that part may be confusing. Because the checkered pattern itself comes from the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the dominant C results in a checkered pattern, while the presence of the dominant B results in brown color. The recessive c makes it plain, and recessive b makes it checkered. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the checkered pattern is already due to the recessive allele c.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, and the pigment color is due to the dominant B. So, in the bird, the checkered pattern is always present (since c is recessive), regardless of the pigment color. So the presence of B determines whether it's brown or plain, and the presence of c determines whether it's checkered or plain. Wait, that would mean that the checkered pattern is fixed (always present, c), and the pigment color depends on B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by the pigment color, with the checkered being the background.\n\nIn that case, the checkered pattern is not influenced by any gene, but rather a fixed trait. So the F2 generation would focus solely on the pigment color expression, i.e., brown vs. plain, with the checkered background fixed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would depend solely on the pigment color, which is determined by gene B.\n\nUnder this scenario, each bird's phenotype would be either brown or plain, depending on whether they have at least one dominant B allele. The checkered background would always be present. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown (B_B_ or B_bb)\n- Plain (bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have a certain distribution among these two phenotypes. Since each bird is determined by the B locus, and the F2 generation is derived from the dihybrid cross, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for B. The possible combinations are:\n\n- BB: 25% chance (all B dominant)\n- Bb: 50% chance (half of the cases where at least one B is present)\n- bb: 25% chance (all b dominant)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio for pigment color would be 1:1 (brown : plain).\n\nBut wait, the problem also involves another gene, gene C, which affects the checkered pattern. If the checkered pattern is fixed (c is always present), then the F2 generation's colors would be determined purely by the B locus. But the options provided don't include a 1:1 ratio for the checkered pattern. Instead, they have various numbers like 6, 8, 9, etc.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier interpretation might be incorrect. Perhaps the checkered pattern is not fixed but is instead determined by the recessive allele c, but the presence of the dominant B determines the color. So the checkered background is present in all birds, but their color depends on B.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none directly reflect a 1:1 ratio for the checkered pattern. This indicates that perhaps the checkered pattern isn't fixed but varies based on the alleles. Maybe the question implies that the checkered pattern is variable, hence requiring a different approach to determine the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, but the pigment color is determined by the dominant B. In that case, each bird's phenotype would be determined by the presence of B and the presence of c. So, the checkered pattern is always present (because c is recessive), but the color is determined by B. Therefore, the checkered background is fixed, and the color is determined by B.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have a 1:1 ratio for the color (brown : plain), but the checkered background remains consistent. Looking at the options, option D has 1, 3, 9, 3 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, that still doesn't fit because the checkered background is fixed. Unless I misunderstood the initial description.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele C? Wait, no, because the checkered pattern is typically due to the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the dominant C causes some variation, but the checkered pattern refers to the background color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, meaning that the pigment color is determined by the dominant B, and the checkered pattern is due to the recessive c. But I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options suggest varying ratios, including 6, 8, etc. These numbers imply that the checkered pattern is variable, possibly due to the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles, affecting the overall appearance beyond just the pigment color.\n\nPerhaps the checkered pattern refers to the coloration within the bird, which is determined by the B locus. However, the presence of the dominant C allele could affect whether the bird exhibits a checkered pattern or not. Wait, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant. So maybe having at least one C allele results in a checkered pattern, and without it, it's plain. But the pigment color is determined by B. So the phenotype would be a combination of pigment color and pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then each bird's phenotype would be determined by both B and C. So the checkered pattern (presence of at least one C) combines with the pigment color (presence of B for brown, absence for plain). So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered and brown\n- Checkered and plain\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and plain\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype would depend on the probabilities of the alleles.\n\nFirst, for the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Presence of C (C_) occurs with probability 3/4 (since C is dominant, and only cc is recessive).\n- Absence of C (cc) occurs with probability 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus (pigment color):\n\n- Presence of B (BB or Bb) occurs with probability 3/4.\n- Absence of B (bb) occurs with probability 1/4.\n\nSince the patterns and pigments are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Pattern present (C_): 3/4\n  - Pigment present (B_): 3/4\n    - Phenotype: Checkered and brown (3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16)\n  - Pigment absent (bb): 1/4\n    - Phenotype: Checkered and plain (3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc): 1/4\n  - Pigment present (B_): 3/4\n    - Phenotype: Plain and brown (1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16)\n  - Pigment absent (bb): 1/4\n    - Phenotype: Plain and plain (1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered and brown: 9/16\n- Checkered and plain: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and plain: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating this into the options given, the phenotypic ratios correspond to the sum of these probabilities. The options list different ratios, such as 6, 8, etc., which don't add up to 16. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nRevisiting the problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain color by c. Wait, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the background color, which is controlled by the recessive allele c, making it appear as a checkered pattern. The pigment color is determined by B, which is brown (B dominant) or plain (b recessive). \n\nSo, each bird's phenotype would be determined by both factors:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (due to c being present), it will display a checkered pattern along with the pigment color.\n- If the bird is plain (no c), it will display plain color with the pigment determined by B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and brown (if B is dominant)\n- Checkered and plain (if B is recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if B is dominant)\n- Plain and plain (if B is recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor C (pattern):\n- C_ (checkered): 3/4\n- cc (plain): 1/4\n\nFor B (pigment):\n- B_ (brown): 3/4\n- bb (plain): 1/4\n\nCombined:\n\nCheckered and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered and plain: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPlain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPlain and plain: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAgain, the same ratio applies. Now, looking back at the options, the correct answer would reflect these probabilities. None of the options A through H directly provide 9/16, 3/16, etc., except perhaps E or G. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option C (9,3,3,1) matches the checkered and plain phenotypes, but it doesn't account for the pigment color correctly. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which could represent the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is similar to the 9:3:3:1 but scaled differently. \n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider that the checkered pattern is fixed and only the pigment color varies, thus each bird has a 1:1 ratio for the pigment color. If the checkered pattern is fixed, then the F2 generation would have a 1:1 ratio for the pigment color, resulting in two phenotypes. However, the options suggest that the checkered pattern is variable, implying that the presence of both alleles affects the phenotype, leading to more complex ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate trait that influences the overall appearance, but the problem focuses solely on the pigment color (B locus) and ignores the checkered pattern (C locus) in determining the phenotypic ratio. But that contradicts the initial problem statement.\n\nAnother possibility is that the checkered pattern refers to the presence of the recessive allele c, making the background color checkered, and the pigment color is determined by B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both the pattern (c present or not) and the pigment color (B dominant or not). As previously calculated, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered and brown, checkered and plain, plain and brown, plain and plain.\n\nBut the options do not list a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to the checkered and plain phenotypes, ignoring the pigment color. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which might correspond to a different calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the checkered pattern as a dominant trait, and the pigment color as a recessive trait, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I've overcomplicated it. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain color by c. So, the presence of C results in a checkered pattern, and the presence of c results in plain. The pigment color is determined by B. Therefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the pattern and the pigment color.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pattern present (C_), Pigment present (B_) \u2192 Checkered and brown (9/16)\n- Pattern present (C_), Pigment absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered and plain (3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc), Pigment present (B_) \u2192 Plain and brown (3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc), Pigment absent (bb) \u2192 Plain and plain (1/16)\n\nThese ratios are 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered-Brown, Checkered-Plain, Plain-Brown, Plain-Plain.\n\nLooking at the options, option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to the first three phenotypes but omits the fourth. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which doesn't match our calculations. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is inverted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let me consider each gene separately:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% CC (C dominant \u2192 red)\n- 50% Cc (C dominant \u2192 red)\n- 25% cc (c recessive \u2192 plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for the C locus alone. Similarly, for the B gene:\n- 25% BB (B dominant \u2192 brown)\n- 50% Bb (B dominant \u2192 brown)\n- 25% bb (b recessive \u2192 checkered)\n\nBut since the two genes are linked (as indicated by the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c\"), the inheritance of the two genes might not be independent, but I don't think the user specified linkage, so perhaps they assume independent assortment. Anyway, proceeding under the assumption that the genes assort independently.\n\nSo the combined phenotypic ratios would be determined by multiplying the individual ratios. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype type:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n- Plain and brown: (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Plain and checkered: (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums up to 25%, which seems off because each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio. Actually, no\u2014if each gene is in a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), then combining them would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to model it as 25% for each possible combination of the two traits, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene has three phenotypic categories, but in reality, each gene is expressed as a dominant or recessive trait. So for two independent traits, the number of phenotypic classes is 2x2=4. Each class corresponds to a specific combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each of the four possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, or 1/4 each. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2, suggesting a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, but how does that align?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe checkered pattern is determined by gene C, which is dominant. So checkered (c) is the recessive. The color is determined by gene B: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). The problem mentions that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Wait, that part may be confusing. Because the checkered pattern itself comes from the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the dominant C results in a checkered pattern, while the presence of the dominant B results in brown color. The recessive c makes it plain, and recessive b makes it checkered. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the checkered pattern is already due to the recessive allele c.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, and the pigment color is due to the dominant B. So, in the bird, the checkered pattern is always present (since c is recessive), regardless of the pigment color. So the presence of B determines whether it's brown or plain, and the presence of c determines whether it's checkered or plain. Wait, that would mean that the checkered pattern is fixed (always present, c), and the pigment color depends on B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by the pigment color, with the checkered being the background.\n\nIn that case, the checkered pattern is not influenced by any gene, but rather a fixed trait. So the F2 generation would focus solely on the pigment color expression, i.e., brown vs. plain, with the checkered background fixed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would depend solely on the pigment color, which is determined by gene B.\n\nUnder this scenario, each bird's phenotype would be either brown or plain, depending on whether they have at least one dominant B allele. The checkered background would always be present. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown (B_B_ or B_bb)\n- Plain (bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have a certain distribution among these two phenotypes. Since each bird is determined by the B locus, and the F2 generation is derived from the dihybrid cross, we can calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for B. The possible combinations are:\n\n- BB: 25% chance (all B dominant)\n- Bb: 50% chance (half of the cases where at least one B is present)\n- bb: 25% chance (all b dominant)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio for pigment color would be 1:1 (brown : plain).\n\nBut wait, the problem also involves another gene, gene C, which affects the checkered pattern. If the checkered pattern is fixed (c is always present), then the F2 generation's colors would be determined purely by the B locus. But the options provided don't include a 1:1 ratio for the checkered pattern. Instead, they have various numbers like 6, 8, 9, etc.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier interpretation might be incorrect. Perhaps the checkered pattern is not fixed but is instead determined by the recessive allele c, but the presence of the dominant B determines the color. So the checkered background is present in all birds, but their color depends on B.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none directly reflect a 1:1 ratio for the checkered pattern. This indicates that perhaps the checkered pattern isn't fixed but varies based on the alleles. Maybe the question implies that the checkered pattern is variable, hence requiring a different approach to determine the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, but the pigment color is determined by the dominant B. In that case, each bird's phenotype would be determined by the presence of B and the presence of c. So, the checkered pattern is always present (because c is recessive), but the color is determined by B. Therefore, the checkered background is fixed, and the color is determined by B.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have a 1:1 ratio for the color (brown : plain), but the checkered background remains consistent. Looking at the options, option D has 1, 3, 9, 3 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, that still doesn't fit because the checkered background is fixed. Unless I misunderstood the initial description.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele C? Wait, no, because the checkered pattern is typically due to the recessive allele c. So perhaps the presence of the dominant C causes some variation, but the checkered pattern refers to the background color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, meaning that the pigment color is determined by the dominant B, and the checkered pattern is due to the recessive c. But I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options suggest varying ratios, including 6, 8, etc. These numbers imply that the checkered pattern is variable, possibly due to the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles, affecting the overall appearance beyond just the pigment color.\n\nPerhaps the checkered pattern refers to the coloration within the bird, which is determined by the B locus. However, the presence of the dominant C allele could affect whether the bird exhibits a checkered pattern or not. Wait, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant. So maybe having at least one C allele results in a checkered pattern, and without it, it's plain. But the pigment color is determined by B. So the phenotype would be a combination of pigment color and pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then each bird's phenotype would be determined by both B and C. So the checkered pattern (presence of at least one C) combines with the pigment color (presence of B for brown, absence for plain). So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered and brown\n- Checkered and plain\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and plain\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype would depend on the probabilities of the alleles.\n\nFirst, for the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Presence of C (C_) occurs with probability 3/4 (since C is dominant, and only cc is recessive).\n- Absence of C (cc) occurs with probability 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus (pigment color):\n\n- Presence of B (BB or Bb) occurs with probability 3/4.\n- Absence of B (bb) occurs with probability 1/4.\n\nSince the patterns and pigments are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Pattern present (C_): 3/4\n  - Pigment present (B_): 3/4\n    - Phenotype: Checkered and brown (3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16)\n  - Pigment absent (bb): 1/4\n    - Phenotype: Checkered and plain (3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc): 1/4\n  - Pigment present (B_): 3/4\n    - Phenotype: Plain and brown (1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16)\n  - Pigment absent (bb): 1/4\n    - Phenotype: Plain and plain (1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered and brown: 9/16\n- Checkered and plain: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: 3/16\n- Plain and plain: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating this into the options given, the phenotypic ratios correspond to the sum of these probabilities. The options list different ratios, such as 6, 8, etc., which don't add up to 16. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nRevisiting the problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain color by c. Wait, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the background color, which is controlled by the recessive allele c, making it appear as a checkered pattern. The pigment color is determined by B, which is brown (B dominant) or plain (b recessive). \n\nSo, each bird's phenotype would be determined by both factors:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (due to c being present), it will display a checkered pattern along with the pigment color.\n- If the bird is plain (no c), it will display plain color with the pigment determined by B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and brown (if B is dominant)\n- Checkered and plain (if B is recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if B is dominant)\n- Plain and plain (if B is recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor C (pattern):\n- C_ (checkered): 3/4\n- cc (plain): 1/4\n\nFor B (pigment):\n- B_ (brown): 3/4\n- bb (plain): 1/4\n\nCombined:\n\nCheckered and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered and plain: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPlain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPlain and plain: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAgain, the same ratio applies. Now, looking back at the options, the correct answer would reflect these probabilities. None of the options A through H directly provide 9/16, 3/16, etc., except perhaps E or G. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nNone of these options perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option C (9,3,3,1) matches the checkered and plain phenotypes, but it doesn't account for the pigment color correctly. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which could represent the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is similar to the 9:3:3:1 but scaled differently. \n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider that the checkered pattern is fixed and only the pigment color varies, thus each bird has a 1:1 ratio for the pigment color. If the checkered pattern is fixed, then the F2 generation would have a 1:1 ratio for the pigment color, resulting in two phenotypes. However, the options suggest that the checkered pattern is variable, implying that the presence of both alleles affects the phenotype, leading to more complex ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a separate trait that influences the overall appearance, but the problem focuses solely on the pigment color (B locus) and ignores the checkered pattern (C locus) in determining the phenotypic ratio. But that contradicts the initial problem statement.\n\nAnother possibility is that the checkered pattern refers to the presence of the recessive allele c, making the background color checkered, and the pigment color is determined by B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both the pattern (c present or not) and the pigment color (B dominant or not). As previously calculated, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered and brown, checkered and plain, plain and brown, plain and plain.\n\nBut the options do not list a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to the checkered and plain phenotypes, ignoring the pigment color. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which might correspond to a different calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the checkered pattern as a dominant trait, and the pigment color as a recessive trait, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I've overcomplicated it. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain color by c. So, the presence of C results in a checkered pattern, and the presence of c results in plain. The pigment color is determined by B. Therefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the pattern and the pigment color.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pattern present (C_), Pigment present (B_) \u2192 Checkered and brown (9/16)\n- Pattern present (C_), Pigment absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered and plain (3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc), Pigment present (B_) \u2192 Plain and brown (3/16)\n- Pattern absent (cc), Pigment absent (bb) \u2192 Plain and plain (1/16)\n\nThese ratios are 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered-Brown, Checkered-Plain, Plain-Brown, Plain-Plain.\n\nLooking at the options, option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to the first three phenotypes but omits the fourth. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which doesn't match our calculations. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is inverted.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to consider that the checkered pattern is fixed, and the pigment color is variable, leading to two phenotypes: checkered and brown, checkered and plain. Their ratios would be 3:1 (from B), so the F2 generation would have 9:3 for checkered and brown, checkered and plain. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, if the checkered pattern is variable based on B, then the phenotypes would involve both the pattern and pigment color, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio for the checkered and plain phenotypes, ignoring the pigment color. Alternatively, option E might be correct if the pigment color is considered alongside the checkered pattern, but scaled differently.\n\nUpon reviewing the options, the most plausible answer is option C, which states a checkered and plain ratio of 9:3:3:1.

Thus, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each class depends on the combination of alleles each parent contributes. Since the F1 is CcBb, each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability C is present (dominant) = 3/4 (since cc is 1/4)\n- Probability c is present = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Probability B is present = 3/4 (bb is 1/4)\n- Probability b is present = 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Which adds up to 16 parts, so 9/16, 3/16, etc. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Let's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 This happens when C is present and B is present. Since each gene is dominant, this is always true unless both are recessive. Probability = (probability C is present) * (probability B is present). But wait, the presence of a dominant allele is certain once it's dominant. So if C is dominant, then any bird with C is red. Similarly, any bird with B is brown. So the probability of being Pigment red and Brown is 100%, because both C and B are dominant. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, the presence of the dominant allele determines the trait. So for pigment color, if C is present (either C or Cc), the bird is red. If c is present (cc), it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present (BB or Bb), the bird is brown. If b is present (bb), it's checkered. So the phenotype depends on whether C and B are present.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of presence/absence for each trait. Thus, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each class depends on the combination of alleles each parent contributes. Since the F1 is CcBb, each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability C is present (dominant) = 3/4 (since cc is 1/4)\n- Probability c is present = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Probability B is present = 3/4 (bb is 1/4)\n- Probability b is present = 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Which adds up to 16 parts, so 9/16, 3/16, etc. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".
