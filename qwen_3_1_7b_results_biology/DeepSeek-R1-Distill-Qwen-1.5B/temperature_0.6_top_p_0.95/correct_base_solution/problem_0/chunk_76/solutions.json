    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But if either is recessive, then the bird may lack one trait.",
    "rollout": " But if either is recessive, then the bird may lack one trait.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain color and brown (cb_B_)\n4. Plain color and checkered (cb_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes correspond to these four combinations. Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 So 100% chance.\nSimilarly, for phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Plain):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nPhenotype 3 (Checkered and Brown):\n- Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nWait, this can't be right because it suggests that all birds in this cross will have both traits, which contradicts the idea of inheritance. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic expression. Maybe the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene results in specific traits, regardless of the other. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will display brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive, regardless of the other. Thus, the possible phenotypes are indeed four combinations, each occurring with certain probabilities.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, the parents are F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb). When crossed, the F2 genotypes will be as follows:\n\nEach parent produces four gametes:\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 will have combinations of these:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Plain\n- cc: Pigment plain (c_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Plain): 25%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Plain): 25%\n\nWait, but this seems too uniform. Usually, in dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1 unless both traits are fully expressed or absent. But in this case, perhaps both traits are fully expressed, making all birds display both traits. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red pigment\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown color\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Therefore, all four phenotypes are possible, each with a 25% chance. This would mean a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, which is option A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me list them again:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red and Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: Red and Plain \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Plain \u2192 25%\n\nIf each has 25%, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Total 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption K:1,2,4,1 \u2192 Total 8\nOption L:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F\n\nWait, actually, all options sum to 16 except K, which sums to 8. But in reality, the total number of birds in F2 should be 16, assuming complete segregation without interference. So, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, i.e., 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly state this. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the phenotypic ratio within each trait rather than overall.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within each trait, not overall. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio.\" So, it could be referring to the ratio among the two traits separately. For example, how many exhibit red versus brown, and how many exhibit plain versus checkered.\n\nIn that case, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for red and brown, all birds will have this, hence 4/4=100% red and brown. Similarly, for red and plain, it's 4/4=100% red and plain. For plain and brown, 100% plain and brown. And plain and plain is also 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio across both traits would be 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\nK. 1,2,4,1 \u2192 8\nL. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nAh! Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, why does option F say 4,4,4,4? Because each phenotype category has 4 birds out of 16. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype would have 4 birds, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. So that's option F. But in the initial problem description, the options don't include F as an option, or do they?\n\nLooking back, the user listed options starting from A to L. Option F is indeed listed as 4,4,4,4. So that must be the correct answer. However, in the problem statement, I noticed that the user included an option K, which is 1,2,4,1. But that sums to 8, which doesn't make sense for F2, which should have 16 birds.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking in terms of phenotypic ratios, maybe I should consider the actual phenotypes and count how many birds have each combination. Let's assume that all birds are diploid and undergo regular Mendelian inheritance.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: F1 \u00d7 F1, which includes all possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB\n\nWait, but in reality, each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. But when forming F2, each gamete combines with another, resulting in the following genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (checkered red)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (mix of pigmented and colored)\n- cb + CB \u2192 same as above\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (checkered red)\n- 50% CcBb (mixed)\n- 25% cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nNow, the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c_), Color brown (b_) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Same as above\n\nSo, the phenotypic counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, adding those up: 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 20, which is less than 16. Hmm, that suggests a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014if F2 has 16 birds, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB: 4 birds\n- 50% CcBb: 8 birds\n- 25% cc bb: 4 birds\n\nTotaling 16 birds. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 4 birds\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n\nThus, Checkered red: 8 birds, Checkered brown: 16 - 8 = 8 birds. Wait, that adds up to 16. So, the phenotypic distribution is 8 Checkered red and 8 Checkered brown. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with at least one 'b' allele will be checkered. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that 'b' is recessive, so 'b' alleles lead to plain color, while 'B' alleles lead to brown. So, the presence of 'B' leads to brown, and the presence of 'b' leads to plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (B): \n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color (b):\n  - Dominant (b) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Recessive (B) \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because 'B' is already dominant over 'b'. So, if B is present, the bird is brown, and if b is present, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if B is present, brown; if b is present, checkered.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that 'c' is recessive for pigment color and 'b' is recessive for body color. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, for pigment color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (b):\n\n- Dominant (b) \u2192 Checkered\n- Recessive (B) \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, a bird is brown if it has at least one dominant B allele, and checkered if it has at least one dominant b allele. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both B and b are dominant \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n2. B is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Brown-Plain\n3. b is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. Both b and B are recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, but that makes four possible phenotypes. Now, let's determine the probabilities for each.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the alleles are independent. So, for pigment color (B):\n\n- Probability of B_: 1 (since at least one B is needed for brown)\n- Probability of b_: 0 (since B is dominant, so any bird with a B allele is brown)\n\nFor body color (b):\n\n- Probability of b_: 1 (since at least one b is needed for checkered)\n- Probability of B_: 0 (since b is recessive, so any bird with a b allele is checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be correct because if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, and if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is brown if B is present, checkered if b is present. But both conditions can't be true simultaneously unless the bird has both B and b alleles, which is impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014a bird has two copies for each gene. So, for pigment color (B), if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. For body color (b), if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is brown-checkered if it has at least one B and at least one b allele. Otherwise, it's brown-plain or checkered-brown depending on which condition is met.\n\nThis complicates things because the presence of B affects the presence of b. Let's model the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (B) and two for body (b).\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (B):\n\n- BB (dominant)\n- Bb (dominant)\n- bb (recessive, plain)\n\nSame for body color (b):\n\n- BB\n- Bb\n- bb\n\nSince the alleles are independent, the combined genotype for each gene is a product of the two. For example, a bird with BB pigment and BB body would have genotype B^BbBb? Wait, no\u2014the alleles are separate. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's construct a Punnett square for both genes:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n\nParental genotype: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nPossible gametes: B (25%) and b (75%)\n\nWait, no\u2014parental genotypes are CC (which has two C alleles) and cc (which has two c alleles). Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB (for pigment) and cc bb (for body). Wait, no\u2014I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nThe parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (pigment) \u00d7 BB (body) \u2192 Genotype: CC BB\n- Parent 2: cc (pigment) \u00d7 bb (body) \u2192 Genotype: cc bb\n\nWhen they breed, the F1 genotypes are obtained by combining the gametes from each parent. Parent 1 can only give CB (pigment dominant, body dominant) because both alleles are C and B. Parent 2 can only give cb (pigment recessive, body recessive). So F1 genotypes are CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes CB and cb. Combining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (all C and all B) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n\nWhich translates to a 1:2:1 ratio. But this is only considering the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. However, the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Body brown\n2. Pigment red, Body checkered\n3. Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, considering that, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Body brown: All birds with at least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant body allele \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment red, Body checkered: Birds with dominant pigment but recessive body \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Pigment plain, Body checkered: Birds with recessive pigment but dominant body \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nFrom the Punnett square, Phenotype A: 25%, Phenotype B: 50%, Phenotype C: 25%. So, the ratio is 25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either is recessive, then the bird may lack one trait.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain color and brown (cb_B_)\n4. Plain color and checkered (cb_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes correspond to these four combinations. Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 So 100% chance.\nSimilarly, for phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Plain):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nPhenotype 3 (Checkered and Brown):\n- Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 So 0% chance.\n\nWait, this can't be right because it suggests that all birds in this cross will have both traits, which contradicts the idea of inheritance. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic expression. Maybe the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene results in specific traits, regardless of the other. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will display red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will display brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive, regardless of the other. Thus, the possible phenotypes are indeed four combinations, each occurring with certain probabilities.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, the parents are F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb). When crossed, the F2 genotypes will be as follows:\n\nEach parent produces four gametes:\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 will have combinations of these:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Plain\n- cc: Pigment plain (c_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Plain): 25%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Plain): 25%\n\nWait, but this seems too uniform. Usually, in dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1 unless both traits are fully expressed or absent. But in this case, perhaps both traits are fully expressed, making all birds display both traits. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red pigment\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown color\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Therefore, all four phenotypes are possible, each with a 25% chance. This would mean a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, which is option A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me list them again:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red and Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: Red and Plain \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Plain \u2192 25%\n\nIf each has 25%, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Total 16\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption J:2,6,3,1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption K:1,2,4,1 \u2192 Total 8\nOption L:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F\n\nWait, actually, all options sum to 16 except K, which sums to 8. But in reality, the total number of birds in F2 should be 16, assuming complete segregation without interference. So, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, i.e., 1:1:1:1, but none of the options directly state this. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the phenotypic ratio within each trait rather than overall.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within each trait, not overall. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio.\" So, it could be referring to the ratio among the two traits separately. For example, how many exhibit red versus brown, and how many exhibit plain versus checkered.\n\nIn that case, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for red and brown, all birds will have this, hence 4/4=100% red and brown. Similarly, for red and plain, it's 4/4=100% red and plain. For plain and brown, 100% plain and brown. And plain and plain is also 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio across both traits would be 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\nK. 1,2,4,1 \u2192 8\nL. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nAh! Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, why does option F say 4,4,4,4? Because each phenotype category has 4 birds out of 16. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype would have 4 birds, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. So that's option F. But in the initial problem description, the options don't include F as an option, or do they?\n\nLooking back, the user listed options starting from A to L. Option F is indeed listed as 4,4,4,4. So that must be the correct answer. However, in the problem statement, I noticed that the user included an option K, which is 1,2,4,1. But that sums to 8, which doesn't make sense for F2, which should have 16 birds.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking in terms of phenotypic ratios, maybe I should consider the actual phenotypes and count how many birds have each combination. Let's assume that all birds are diploid and undergo regular Mendelian inheritance.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: F1 \u00d7 F1, which includes all possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB\n\nWait, but in reality, each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. But when forming F2, each gamete combines with another, resulting in the following genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (checkered red)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (mix of pigmented and colored)\n- cb + CB \u2192 same as above\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (checkered red)\n- 50% CcBb (mixed)\n- 25% cc bb (checkered brown)\n\nNow, the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c_), Color brown (b_) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Same as above\n\nSo, the phenotypic counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nWait, adding those up: 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 20, which is less than 16. Hmm, that suggests a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014if F2 has 16 birds, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB: 4 birds\n- 50% CcBb: 8 birds\n- 25% cc bb: 4 birds\n\nTotaling 16 birds. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Checkered brown: 8 birds\n- Checkered brown: 4 birds\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n\nThus, Checkered red: 8 birds, Checkered brown: 16 - 8 = 8 birds. Wait, that adds up to 16. So, the phenotypic distribution is 8 Checkered red and 8 Checkered brown. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with at least one 'b' allele will be checkered. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that 'b' is recessive, so 'b' alleles lead to plain color, while 'B' alleles lead to brown. So, the presence of 'B' leads to brown, and the presence of 'b' leads to plain.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (B): \n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color (b):\n  - Dominant (b) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Recessive (B) \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because 'B' is already dominant over 'b'. So, if B is present, the bird is brown, and if b is present, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if B is present, brown; if b is present, checkered.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that 'c' is recessive for pigment color and 'b' is recessive for body color. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, for pigment color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (b):\n\n- Dominant (b) \u2192 Checkered\n- Recessive (B) \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, a bird is brown if it has at least one dominant B allele, and checkered if it has at least one dominant b allele. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both B and b are dominant \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n2. B is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Brown-Plain\n3. b is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n4. Both b and B are recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, but that makes four possible phenotypes. Now, let's determine the probabilities for each.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the alleles are independent. So, for pigment color (B):\n\n- Probability of B_: 1 (since at least one B is needed for brown)\n- Probability of b_: 0 (since B is dominant, so any bird with a B allele is brown)\n\nFor body color (b):\n\n- Probability of b_: 1 (since at least one b is needed for checkered)\n- Probability of B_: 0 (since b is recessive, so any bird with a b allele is checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be correct because if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, and if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is brown if B is present, checkered if b is present. But both conditions can't be true simultaneously unless the bird has both B and b alleles, which is impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014a bird has two copies for each gene. So, for pigment color (B), if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. For body color (b), if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So, the phenotype is brown-checkered if it has at least one B and at least one b allele. Otherwise, it's brown-plain or checkered-brown depending on which condition is met.\n\nThis complicates things because the presence of B affects the presence of b. Let's model the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (B) and two for body (b).\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (B):\n\n- BB (dominant)\n- Bb (dominant)\n- bb (recessive, plain)\n\nSame for body color (b):\n\n- BB\n- Bb\n- bb\n\nSince the alleles are independent, the combined genotype for each gene is a product of the two. For example, a bird with BB pigment and BB body would have genotype B^BbBb? Wait, no\u2014the alleles are separate. Let me think differently.\n\nLet's construct a Punnett square for both genes:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n\nParental genotype: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nPossible gametes: B (25%) and b (75%)\n\nWait, no\u2014parental genotypes are CC (which has two C alleles) and cc (which has two c alleles). Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB (for pigment) and cc bb (for body). Wait, no\u2014I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nThe parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (pigment) \u00d7 BB (body) \u2192 Genotype: CC BB\n- Parent 2: cc (pigment) \u00d7 bb (body) \u2192 Genotype: cc bb\n\nWhen they breed, the F1 genotypes are obtained by combining the gametes from each parent. Parent 1 can only give CB (pigment dominant, body dominant) because both alleles are C and B. Parent 2 can only give cb (pigment recessive, body recessive). So F1 genotypes are CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes CB and cb. Combining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (all C and all B) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n- 50% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n\nWhich translates to a 1:2:1 ratio. But this is only considering the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. However, the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Body brown\n2. Pigment red, Body checkered\n3. Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, considering that, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Body brown: All birds with at least one dominant pigment and at least one dominant body allele \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment red, Body checkered: Birds with dominant pigment but recessive body \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Pigment plain, Body checkered: Birds with recessive pigment but dominant body \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nFrom the Punnett square, Phenotype A: 25%, Phenotype B: 50%, Phenotype C: 25%. So, the ratio is 25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But if either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " But if either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has a dominant allele for one trait, it will have that trait expressed regardless of the other. So the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n- Probability = 1 (since any C results in red)\nFor checkered (c):\n- Probability = 0 (since only c results in checkered)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n- Probability = 1 (since any B results in brown)\nFor checkered (b):\n- Probability = 0 (since only b results in checkered)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because then all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the idea of some having one trait and others none. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps each gene contributes to different traits, but not necessarily both being expressed unless both alleles are dominant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't simply additive but rather follows the dominant-recessive rule where a bird may exhibit one trait or another depending on the alleles. But in this case, since both traits are influenced by separate genes, each bird could potentially have one or both traits, but not necessarily both.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Each bird has two genes, each affecting a different trait. So the phenotype will display the combination of traits based on the alleles. For example:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. Otherwise, it won't have either trait. Wait, but that seems too simplistic. In reality, an animal might have one trait expressed even if another is recessive. But according to the problem statement, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is controlled by a recessive allele b.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh, no, perhaps I misread it. It says \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is controlled by a recessive allele b.\" That doesn't make sense because a single gene can control multiple traits. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to say that C controls pigment and B controls color. So, each bird has two genes, each determining a different trait. So pigment is controlled by gene C (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain), and color is controlled by gene B (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on the alleles for both genes. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. If neither is dominant, it'll be plain and checkered. But wait, that doesn't seem accurate because an animal can have one trait expressed without the other. However, according to the problem, it's stated that the traits are expressed independently. So, the bird will express both traits if both genes are dominant. Otherwise, it won't express either trait. Wait, that seems off because in reality, an animal might have one trait expressed due to one gene and another due to another, but not both. But according to the problem, perhaps each trait is expressed if the corresponding gene is dominant. So, the bird's phenotype will be determined by whether each trait is expressed. That is, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. If it has neither, it will be plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible genotypes for a bird:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C_: Pigment red\n  - cc: Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - BB_: Brown\n  - Bb or bB: Checkered\n\nSince the two traits are under independent regulation, the combined phenotype can be represented as combinations of these traits. Thus, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered (C_ and bB)\n3. Plain AND Brown (cc and B_)\n4. Plain AND Checkered (cc and bB)\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes. Now, let's determine the probability of each phenotype occurring in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, what is the F2 generation? It's the result of crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. Each gene segregates independently, so we can treat them separately.\n\nFor each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\n- Gene C (pale vs. checkered): \n  - C_: 3/4\n  - cc: 1/4\n\n- Gene B (brown vs. checkered): \n  - BB_: 3/4\n  - Bb or bB: 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities for each gene contributing to that phenotype.\n\nSo, let's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Brown (C_ and B_):\n  - P(C_) = 3/4\n  - P(B_) = 3/4\n  - Combined probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered (C_ and bB):\n  - P(C_) = 3/4\n  - P(bB) = 1/4\n  - Combined probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain AND Brown (cc and B_):\n  - P(cc) = 1/4\n  - P(B_) = 3/4\n  - Combined probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain AND Checkered (cc and bB):\n  - P(cc) = 1/4\n  - P(bB) = 1/4\n  - Combined probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in the F2 generation, assuming a large enough population, the expected ratios would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options provided, option H states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also doesn't match. Option G has a ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off. Option E has a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is less than the total population, implying incomplete counting. Option J mentions a ratio of 2,6,3,1, totaling 12, which also seems inconsistent. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has a dominant allele for one trait, it will have that trait expressed regardless of the other. So the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n- Probability = 1 (since any C results in red)\nFor checkered (c):\n- Probability = 0 (since only c results in checkered)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n- Probability = 1 (since any B results in brown)\nFor checkered (b):\n- Probability = 0 (since only b results in checkered)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because then all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the idea of some having one trait and others none. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps each gene contributes to different traits, but not necessarily both being expressed unless both alleles are dominant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't simply additive but rather follows the dominant-recessive rule where a bird may exhibit one trait or another depending on the alleles. But in this case, since both traits are influenced by separate genes, each bird could potentially have one or both traits, but not necessarily both.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Each bird has two genes, each affecting a different trait. So the phenotype will display the combination of traits based on the alleles. For example:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. Otherwise, it won't have either trait. Wait, but that seems too simplistic. In reality, an animal might have one trait expressed even if another is recessive. But according to the problem statement, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is controlled by a recessive allele b.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh, no, perhaps I misread it. It says \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is controlled by a recessive allele b.\" That doesn't make sense because a single gene can control multiple traits. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to say that C controls pigment and B controls color. So, each bird has two genes, each determining a different trait. So pigment is controlled by gene C (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain), and color is controlled by gene B (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype depends on the alleles for both genes. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. If neither is dominant, it'll be plain and checkered. But wait, that doesn't seem accurate because an animal can have one trait expressed without the other. However, according to the problem, it's stated that the traits are expressed independently. So, the bird will express both traits if both genes are dominant. Otherwise, it won't express either trait. Wait, that seems off because in reality, an animal might have one trait expressed due to one gene and another due to another, but not both. But according to the problem, perhaps each trait is expressed if the corresponding gene is dominant. So, the bird's phenotype will be determined by whether each trait is expressed. That is, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be brown. If it has neither, it will be plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible genotypes for a bird:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C_: Pigment red\n  - cc: Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - BB_: Brown\n  - Bb or bB: Checkered\n\nSince the two traits are under independent regulation, the combined phenotype can be represented as combinations of these traits.

Pigment red AND Brown (C_ and B_):\n  - P(C_) = 3/4\n  - P(B_) = 3/4\n  - Combined probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red AND Checkered (C_ and bB):\n  - P(C_) = 3/4\n  - P(bB) = 1/4\n  - Combined probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain AND Brown (cc and B_):\n  - P(cc) = 1/4\n  - P(B_) = 3/4\n  - Combined probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4.

Wait, but in reality, a bird could have one dominant and one recessive allele for different genes, leading to a blend of traits, but in this case, since each bird has two separate dominant or recessive alleles for each gene, the phenotype depends entirely on the combination.\n\nWait, no, each bird is diploid and has two alleles for each gene. So, for the C locus: \n- If both alleles are C (or at least one is C), the bird has pigment red.\n- If both are c (recessive), then it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for B locus: \n- Both B alleles (at least one B) \u2192 brown\n- Both b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 checkered red (assuming that checkered is a distinct phenotype)\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown (but wait, if both are recessive, does that mean it's checkered? Yes.)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, the bird is plain (for pigment) and plain (for color)? Or checkered? Wait, the B gene determines color, where B is dominant brown and b is recessive checkered. So, if both B alleles are recessive (bb), the bird is plain (since B is dominant). Similarly, if both c alleles are recessive (cc), the bird is plain for pigment, regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, the C locus determines pigment: C is red, c is plain. The B locus determines color: B is brown, b is checkered. So, for a bird to be checkered, it must have c (so C is recessive) and b (so B is recessive). So the phenotype is checkered. Otherwise, if either C is recessive or B is recessive, the bird has one of the other traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (color brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (pigment red) and b (color checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (pigment plain) and B (color brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c (pigment plain) and b (color checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's determine the probability for each phenotype.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red (C) is 1 (since both parents are CC BB, so any gamete will contribute at least one C). Similarly, the probability of having color brown (B) is also 1. So the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, meaning all birds will have both traits. But wait, that seems impossible because some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird has C and B, it'll have both traits. If it has C and b, it'll have red pigment and checkered color. If it has c and B, it'll have plain pigment and brown color. If it has c and b, it'll have plain pigment and checkered color.\n\nSo, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, what's the probability of each?\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n- Probability of getting at least one C: Since both parents are CC, the bird will always get C. So 100% chance of pigment red.\n\nFor color brown (B):\n- Similarly, both parents are BB, so any gamete will have B. So 100% chance of color brown.\n\nSo, the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, but wait, that can't be right because in reality, a bird can have one trait and not the other, depending on the alleles. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014the C locus and B locus are independent. So the presence of C and/or B affects the phenotype. Let's recast it:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All birds with at least one C and at least one B will have this phenotype. Since both parents are CC BB, every offspring will receive at least one C and at least one B, so this phenotype is certain.\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): This happens when the bird receives at least one C and at least one b. Since the bird must have at least one C (as both parents are CC), but for B, it needs at least one b (from the cc parent). So the probability is (1/2) for B (since half the time you get b).\n\n3. Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): This happens when the bird receives at least one c (from cc) and at least one B. The probability for B is 1 (since at least one B), and for c, it's 1/2. So the combined probability is 1 * 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n4. Plain pigment (c) and Checkered color (b): This happens when the bird gets at least one c and at least one b. The probability for B is 1/2, and for c is 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 100% \u2192 1\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 1/2\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 1/2\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier analysis, all birds have both traits except when neither C nor B is dominant. Wait, but since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring should have at least one C and one B. Therefore, all four phenotypes exist, but their probabilities are 1, 1/2, 1/2, and 1/4 respectively.\n\nHowever, looking back, the options given don't seem to match this straightforward calculation. Instead, the options involve specific counts of each phenotype across F2 generations. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios, such as 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc. These suggest that the F2 phenotypes aren't equally distributed but rather follow a Mendelian ratio based on independent assortment.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem involves incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that C is dominant and c is recessive, implying complete dominance. However, the way the options are structured makes me think that the phenotypic ratios are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes, each with two possible alleles.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C gene, both parents are CC, so all gametes are CB. For the B gene, both parents are BB, so all gametes are BB. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, each gamete is CB, and for the B locus, each gamete is BB. Therefore, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC (probability 25%, as each gamete contributes C)\n- From CB x BB: CB (probability 50%, as each gamete contributes C and B)\n- From BB x CB: CB (probability 50%, same reasoning)\n- From BB x BB: BB (probability 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Let me use a Punnett square properly.\n\nParental gametes for C: CB\nParental gametes for B: BB\nF2 offspring combinations:\n\nFor C:\n- CB x BB \u2192 Each gamete contributes C or B.\nWait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or BB. Wait, correction: Each parent contributes one allele per gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB for both genes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb for both genes. So F1 is CcBb, producing gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nThus, F2 would have:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CC (25%)\nFrom CB x cb: Cc (50%)\nFrom cb x CB: Cc (50%)\nFrom cb x cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotype distribution is:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n- CC and Cc for the C locus \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc for the C locus \u2192 Plain\n- For the B locus:\n  - BB and Bb \u2192 Brown\n  - bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype combines both loci. Let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (C dominant) and Bb \u2192 Brown red\n3. Cc (C dominant) and BB \u2192 Brown red\n4. Cc (C dominant) and Bb \u2192 Brown red\n5. CC (C dominant) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. Cc (C dominant) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc (c recessive) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc (c recessive) and Bb \u2192 Plain red\n9. cc (c recessive) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,5,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Brown red: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:2, which simplifies to 3/10 checkered red, 2/10 plain red, etc. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 2, plain red 6, brown red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that's not matching my ratio. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cases 1,5,6 \u2192 3\n2. Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n3. Brown red: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3\n4. Plain brown: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3+2+3+2=10.\n\nIf the options are giving specific numbers, say option D: checkered red 2, plain red 6, brown red 2, plain brown 6, that sums to 16, which doesn't make sense. My count is 10, so none of the options directly match unless I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 ratio without considering dominance, treating all as phenotypically distinct based on the combination of both traits. In that case, each genotype corresponds to exactly one phenotype, and the ratio would be based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn F2:\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Brown red\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- BB: 25% \u2192 Brown\n- Bb: 50% \u2192 Brown\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. Wait, no\u2014for the C locus, all genotypes CC and Cc are red, while cc is plain. For the B locus, BB, Bb are brown, bb is checkered. So the phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nSo the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (from cc and BB)\n2. Plain red (from cc and bb)\n3. Brown red (from Cc and BB)\n4. Checkered brown (from CC and bb)\n5. Checkered red (same as class 1)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nThese are four distinct phenotypes, each corresponding to specific counts in the F2 population.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotype distribution:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Brown red\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Brown red\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Brown red\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 5: Checkered brown\n\nWait, but that's six phenotypes, but according to dominance, some may combine. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are defined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other. So each of the four combinations above is a distinct phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotype distribution, the number of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): CC (25%) and cc (25%), but wait, no\u2014phenotype 1 is from cc (since C is recessive) and BB (since B is dominant), so only the cc genotype contributes to phenotype 1. Similarly, phenotype 2 is from Cc and bb, which is Cc genotype. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Only cc (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: Only Cc (50%)\n- Phenotype 3: Only cc (25%)\n- Phenotype 4: Only BB and Bb (25% + 50% = 75%)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Because in terms of phenotype, each genotype maps to a unique phenotype based on the combination of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Brown red\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- BB \u2192 Brown red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown red\n- bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (25%) and bb (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Plain red: cc (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Brown red: Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 50% (25% Cc + 25% BB + 50% Bb = 100%)\n- Checkered brown: bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 50% +25% +50% +25% = 150%, which is incorrect. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the mapping.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C and one dominant B, it has both traits, making it Checkered red or Brown based on the combination.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, irrespective of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it has both traits: Checkered red or Brown based on which allele is dominant.\n\nBut in reality, each gene's dominance acts independently, so the phenotype is a combination of both. Therefore, the four possible phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): Only the cc genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain red): Only the Cc genotype contributes, which is 50% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain brown): Only the cc genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered brown): Only the bb genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut wait, this can't be right because adding them up would exceed 100%. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because some genotypes map to the same phenotype. Specifically, the cc genotype (which includes both B and b) results in Checkered brown, whereas the bb genotype results in Checkered red. Similarly, Cc results in Brown red, and so on.\n\nBut in reality, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and bb)\n2. Plain red (Cc)\n3. Brown red (Cc and BB)\n4. Checkered brown (cc and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let me re-examine:\n\n- For the C locus: C (dominant) \u2192 red, c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n- For the B locus: B (dominant) \u2192 brown, b (recessive) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, a bird with both C and B alleles (C_B_) will have both traits, resulting in Checkered red.\n\nA bird with C but not B (C_bb) will have red pigment and checkered, so Checkered brown.\n\nA bird with c but not B (cc_B) will have plain pigment and brown, so Plain brown.\n\nA bird with neither C nor B (cc_bb) will have plain pigment and checkered, so Plain red.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_): 25% (only cc)\n2. Plain red (cc_b_): 25% (only bb)\n3. Brown red (C_bb): 25% (only Cc)\n4. Checkered brown (cc_B): 25% (only bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each genotype has a 25% chance in F2, so:\n\n- C_B_: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_bb: 25% \u2192 Brown red\n- cc_B_: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc_bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Brown red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWhich is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, or ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. Wait, but in reality, a bird could have one dominant and one recessive allele for different genes, leading to a blend of traits, but in this case, since each bird has two separate dominant or recessive alleles for each gene, the phenotype depends entirely on the combination.\n\nWait, no, each bird is diploid and has two alleles for each gene. So, for the C locus: \n- If both alleles are C (or at least one is C), the bird has pigment red.\n- If both are c (recessive), then it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for B locus: \n- Both B alleles (at least one B) \u2192 brown\n- Both b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 checkered red (assuming that checkered is a distinct phenotype)\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown (but wait, if both are recessive, does that mean it's checkered? Yes.)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, the bird is plain (for pigment) and plain (for color)? Or checkered? Wait, the B gene determines color, where B is dominant brown and b is recessive checkered. So, if both B alleles are recessive (bb), the bird is plain (since B is dominant). Similarly, if both c alleles are recessive (cc), the bird is plain for pigment, regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, the C locus determines pigment: C is red, c is plain. The B locus determines color: B is brown, b is checkered. So, for a bird to be checkered, it must have c (so C is recessive) and b (so B is recessive). So the phenotype is checkered. Otherwise, if either C is recessive or B is recessive, the bird has one of the other traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (color brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (pigment red) and b (color checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. c (pigment plain) and B (color brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c (pigment plain) and b (color checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, let's determine the probability for each phenotype.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red (C) is 1 (since both parents are CC BB, so any gamete will contribute at least one C). Similarly, the probability of having color brown (B) is also 1. So the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, meaning all birds will have both traits. But wait, that seems impossible because some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird has C and B, it'll have both traits. If it has C and b, it'll have red pigment and checkered color. If it has c and B, it'll have plain pigment and brown color. If it has c and b, it'll have plain pigment and checkered color.\n\nSo, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, what's the probability of each?\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n- Probability of getting at least one C: Since both parents are CC, the bird will always get C. So 100% chance of pigment red.\n\nFor color brown (B):\n- Similarly, both parents are BB, so any gamete will have B. So 100% chance of color brown.\n\nSo, the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, but wait, that can't be right because in reality, a bird can have one trait and not the other, depending on the alleles. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014the C locus and B locus are independent. So the presence of C and/or B affects the phenotype. Let's recast it:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All birds with at least one C and at least one B will have this phenotype. Since both parents are CC BB, every offspring will receive at least one C and at least one B, so this phenotype is certain.\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): This happens when the bird receives at least one C and at least one b. Since the bird must have at least one C (as both parents are CC), but for B, it needs at least one b (from the cc parent). So the probability is (1/2) for B (since half the time you get b).\n\n3. Plain pigment (c) and Brown color (B): This happens when the bird receives at least one c (from cc) and at least one B. The probability for B is 1 (since at least one B), and for c, it's 1/2. So the combined probability is 1 * 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n4. Plain pigment (c) and Checkered color (b): This happens when the bird gets at least one c and at least one b. The probability for B is 1/2, and for c is 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 100% \u2192 1\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 1/2\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 1/2\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nBut wait, according to our earlier analysis, all birds have both traits except when neither C nor B is dominant. Wait, but since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring should have at least one C and one B. Therefore, all four phenotypes exist, but their probabilities are 1, 1/2, 1/2, and 1/4 respectively.\n\nHowever, looking back, the options given don't seem to match this straightforward calculation. Instead, the options involve specific counts of each phenotype across F2 generations. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A through H provide various ratios, such as 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc. These suggest that the F2 phenotypes aren't equally distributed but rather follow a Mendelian ratio based on independent assortment.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem involves incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that C is dominant and c is recessive, implying complete dominance. However, the way the options are structured makes me think that the phenotypic ratios are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes, each with two possible alleles.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C gene, both parents are CC, so all gametes are CB. For the B gene, both parents are BB, so all gametes are BB. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, for the C locus, each gamete is CB, and for the B locus, each gamete is BB. Therefore, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC (probability 25%, as each gamete contributes C)\n- From CB x BB: CB (probability 50%, as each gamete contributes C and B)\n- From BB x CB: CB (probability 50%, same reasoning)\n- From BB x BB: BB (probability 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Let me use a Punnett square properly.\n\nParental gametes for C: CB\nParental gametes for B: BB\nF2 offspring combinations:\n\nFor C:\n- CB x BB \u2192 Each gamete contributes C or B.\nWait, no\u2014each gamete is either CB or BB. Wait, correction: Each parent contributes one allele per gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB for both genes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb for both genes. So F1 is CcBb, producing gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.\n\nThus, F2 would have:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CC (25%)\nFrom CB x cb: Cc (50%)\nFrom cb x CB: Cc (50%)\nFrom cb x cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotype distribution is:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n- CC and Cc for the C locus \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc for the C locus \u2192 Plain\n- For the B locus:\n  - BB and Bb \u2192 Brown\n  - bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype combines both loci. Let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (C dominant) and Bb \u2192 Brown red\n3. Cc (C dominant) and BB \u2192 Brown red\n4. Cc (C dominant) and Bb \u2192 Brown red\n5. CC (C dominant) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. Cc (C dominant) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc (c recessive) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc (c recessive) and Bb \u2192 Plain red\n9. cc (c recessive) and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,5,6 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Brown red: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:2, which simplifies to 3/10 checkered red, 2/10 plain red, etc. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 2, plain red 6, brown red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that's not matching my ratio. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cases 1,5,6 \u2192 3\n2. Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n3. Brown red: Cases 2,3,4 \u2192 3\n4. Plain brown: Cases 5,6 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3+2+3+2=10.\n\nIf the options are giving specific numbers, say option D: checkered red 2, plain red 6, brown red 2, plain brown 6, that sums to 16, which doesn't make sense. My count is 10, so none of the options directly match unless I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 ratio without considering dominance, treating all as phenotypically distinct based on the combination of both traits. In that case, each genotype corresponds to exactly one phenotype, and the ratio would be based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn F2:\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Brown red\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- BB: 25% \u2192 Brown\n- Bb: 50% \u2192 Brown\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. Wait, no\u2014for the C locus, all genotypes CC and Cc are red, while cc is plain. For the B locus, BB, Bb are brown, bb is checkered. So the phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nSo the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (from cc and BB)\n2. Plain red (from cc and bb)\n3. Brown red (from Cc and BB)\n4. Checkered brown (from CC and bb)\n5. Checkered red (same as class 1)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nThese are four distinct phenotypes, each corresponding to specific counts in the F2 population.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotype distribution:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Brown red\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Brown red\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Brown red\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 5: Checkered brown\n\nWait, but that's six phenotypes, but according to dominance, some may combine. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are defined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other. So each of the four combinations above is a distinct phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotype distribution, the number of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): CC (25%) and cc (25%), but wait, no\u2014phenotype 1 is from cc (since C is recessive) and BB (since B is dominant), so only the cc genotype contributes to phenotype 1. Similarly, phenotype 2 is from Cc and bb, which is Cc genotype. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Only cc (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: Only Cc (50%)\n- Phenotype 3: Only cc (25%)\n- Phenotype 4: Only BB and Bb (25% + 50% = 75%)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Because in terms of phenotype, each genotype maps to a unique phenotype based on the combination of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Brown red\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- BB \u2192 Brown red\n- Bb \u2192 Brown red\n- bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (25%) and bb (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Plain red: cc (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Brown red: Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 50% (25% Cc + 25% BB + 50% Bb = 100%)\n- Checkered brown: bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 50% +25% +50% +25% = 150%, which is incorrect. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the mapping.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C and one dominant B, it has both traits, making it Checkered red or Brown based on the combination.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, irrespective of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it has both traits: Checkered red or Brown based on which allele is dominant.\n\nBut in reality, each gene's dominance acts independently, so the phenotype is a combination of both. Therefore, the four possible phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): Only the cc genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain red): Only the Cc genotype contributes, which is 50% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain brown): Only the cc genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered brown): Only the bb genotype contributes, which is 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut wait, this can't be right because adding them up would exceed 100%. Wait, no\u2014the issue arises because some genotypes map to the same phenotype. Specifically, the cc genotype (which includes both B and b) results in Checkered brown, whereas the bb genotype results in Checkered red. Similarly, Cc results in Brown red, and so on.\n\nBut in reality, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and bb)\n2. Plain red (Cc)\n3. Brown red (Cc and BB)\n4. Checkered brown (cc and bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let me re-examine:\n\n- For the C locus: C (dominant) \u2192 red, c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n- For the B locus: B (dominant) \u2192 brown, b (recessive) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, a bird with both C and B alleles (C_B_) will have both traits, resulting in Checkered red.\n\nA bird with C but not B (C_bb) will have red pigment and checkered, so Checkered brown.\n\nA bird with c but not B (cc_B) will have plain pigment and brown, so Plain brown.\n\nA bird with neither C nor B (cc_bb) will have plain pigment and checkered, so Plain red.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_): 25% (only cc)\n2. Plain red (cc_b_): 25% (only bb)\n3. Brown red (C_bb): 25% (only Cc)\n4. Checkered brown (cc_B): 25% (only bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each genotype has a 25% chance in F2, so:\n\n- C_B_: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_bb: 25% \u2192 Brown red\n- cc_B_: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc_bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Brown red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWhich is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, or ",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This requires C and B to be dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Requires C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Requires c and B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Requires c and B recessive.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. However, since both genes are being considered simultaneously, the calculation isn't straightforward because the presence of one allele affects the others. Instead, we should consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Let's list all possible genotypes for each bird and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Plain, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, the number of possible genotypes is limited by the number of alleles. For example, for the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. Similarly for the B locus. But when considering both genes together, the possible genotypes are the combinations of these. However, the actual phenotypic expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So, instead of listing all nine possible combinations, let's focus on the phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B), phenotype is Pigment red and Brown.\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b), phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B), phenotype is Plain and Brown.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is absent (b), phenotype is Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining how likely each gene is to be dominant. Since each bird is formed by crossing two parents, we can compute the probabilities based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 (first filial generation) will all be CcBb, as previously established. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the proportions for each genotype are 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- For CC: Pigment red (C is dominant), and Brown (B is dominant)\n- For Cc: Pigment red (C dominant), and Checkered (B recessive)\n- For cc: Plain (c dominant), and Brown (B dominant)\n- For cC (same as Cc): Pigment red, Checkered\n- For cc: Plain, Brown\n- For cc: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C genotype) and B is present (any B genotype). In terms of F2, this includes all individuals except those who are cc and bb. So the number of such individuals is (number of CC, Cc, and Cc) minus the cc and bb cases. Since each F2 individual is a gamete from F1 (which is CcBb), the possible combinations are:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4 x 4 = 16 (since each parent contributes 4 gametes).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: All except cc and bb. So 16 - 2 = 14 individuals?\nWait, no\u2014let me correct this. The correct way is to look at each F2 genotype and see what phenotype it expresses.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits, which isn't the case. Wait, no\u2014that approach is flawed because the presence of one allele affects the others. Instead, we should use the formula for independent genes:\n\nProbability of phenotype = product of probabilities for each dominant trait.\n\nSo for Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B must be dominant.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But this indicates that every bird has both traits, which contradicts reality because some birds might lack one trait despite having the other. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed. So the probability of having both traits is indeed 1, but that also implies that all birds have both traits, which can't be true because some birds may lack one trait due to the other being dominant. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it will have both traits. If it has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it'll have pigment red and checkered. If it has c (recessive) and B (dominant), it'll have plain and brown. And if it has c and b, it'll have plain and checkered. So the possible phenotypes are four: RG (pigment red and brown), RC (pigment red and checkered), cB (plain and brown), and cb (plain and checkered). \n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype RG: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But wait, that's not correct because it assumes all individuals have both traits, which isn't possible. Actually, the correct way is to realize that the presence of both dominant alleles leads to both traits. So the probability of having both traits is 1. But that's not accurate because in reality, some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014this is a confusion between the presence of alleles and the traits themselves. Actually, if both genes are dominant, the bird will exhibit both traits. So the probability of having both traits is 1, but that still doesn't explain why some birds might lack one trait unless the other is dominant. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should calculate the probabilities differently.\n\nLet me try this approach: Calculate the probability for each phenotype by considering the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\n1. Phenotype RG (pigment red and brown):\n   - Requires C (dominant) and B (dominant).\n   - Genotype required: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 All these have at least one C and one B.\n   - Number of such genotypes: 4\n   - Since each F2 individual is a combination of two F1 gametes, and each F1 is CcBb, the number of such individuals is (number of ways to get C from one parent and C from the other) times similar for B. Wait, this is getting complicated. Instead, let's remember that the probability of a bird having both traits is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant. Since each gene is inherited independently, P(RG) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But this can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some might lack one. Wait, I'm making a mistake here. The correct approach is to recognize that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the trait. So, for RG, both C and B must be dominant, which is always true for any bird where C and B are dominant. Therefore, the probability is 1, but that's not possible because not all birds can have both traits. Wait, no\u2014all birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they will express both traits. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1, but this still doesn't account for the fact that some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014it's impossible because if a bird has one dominant allele, it will have the corresponding trait. So if a bird has C dominant, it will have pigment red, regardless of B. Similarly, if B is dominant, it will have brown, regardless of C. Therefore, the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if neither C nor B is dominant, i.e., if both are recessive. So the probability of having both traits is 1, and the probability of not having both traits is zero, which makes sense because all birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, hence expressing both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for both traits being present is 100%, and the remaining 0% have either one trait or none. But this contradicts the options given. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits because each gene is present in at least one copy. Therefore, all 16 F2 individuals will have both traits, leading to a 1:0:0:0 phenotypic ratio. But that can't be right because the options don't include 100%:0. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,0,0\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nNone of these options suggest a 1:0:0:0 ratio. So clearly, my reasoning is flawed somewhere. Let me reconsider the approach. Perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between the genes. Maybe the presence of one allele masks the other, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expressions are additive, allowing different combinations. Wait, perhaps I should model the possible genotypes and their resulting phenotypes correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or C) and B is present (either B or B), phenotype is Pigment red and Brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent (B), phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present, phenotype is Plain and Brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, phenotype is Plain and Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are four categories, and their counts depend on the number of F2 individuals that fall into each category.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (Pigment red)\n- 50% Cc (Pigment red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n\nAnd for the B gene:\n\n- 25% BB (Brown)\n- 50% Bb (Brown)\n- 25% bb (Checkered)\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, the actual phenotypes depend on the combination of these. As before, the only way to have both traits is if both C and B are present. Otherwise, the bird may have one trait or none, depending on which gene is dominant. But according to our previous conclusion, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will have both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals should have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 16 individuals with both traits (RG), and 0 individuals without both traits. But this contradicts the answer choices, indicating that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in the interpretation of the genetic loci. Maybe the two genes interact in a way that certain phenotypes combine rather than simply adding traits. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant allele is not necessarily the same across both genes, but that's not indicated in the problem. Another possibility is that the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to specific phenotypic categories. For instance, if a bird has both C and B dominant, it shows both traits. If it has only one dominant allele, it shows that trait plus the recessive counterpart. But that's not standard practice. Usually, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it exhibits that trait. So, if a bird has both C and B dominant, it exhibits both traits. If it has only C dominant, it exhibits pigment red and brown (assuming B is recessive). If it has only B dominant, it exhibits brown and checkered. If it has neither, it's plain and checkered. So, all F2 individuals would have both traits, leading to a 100% ratio for both traits.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, none have a 1:0:0:0 ratio. This suggests that my analysis is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive alleles, while the brown is determined by the dominant allele. So, perhaps the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. Wait, but in the context of the problem, the checkered pattern refers to the recessive phenotype, and brown refers to the dominant. So, the phenotype could be described as either \"pigment red and brown\" (if both C and B are present), \"pigment red and checkered\" (if C is present and B is recessive), \"plain and brown\" (if C is recessive and B is dominant), and \"plain and checkered\" (if both are recessive). \n\nNow, considering this, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Occurs when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_). \n   - P(C_) = 1 (since C is dominant in the F1, and F1 is CcBb, so all offspring will have at least one C allele)\n   - P(B_) = 1 (similar logic)\n   - Thus, P(Pigment red and brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n   But this can't be correct because not all F2 individuals will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele ensures the trait is expressed. So, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits, leading to a 100% ratio for both traits. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the presence of one dominant allele leading to the trait, but the interaction between the two genes complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio under the assumption that only one dominant allele leads to the trait, not both. But that would change the approach entirely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is considering the coat color and pigmentation separately. For example, the brown color is expressed if B is present (regardless of C), and checkered if both are recessive. Pigment red is expressed if C is present (regardless of B). Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele), phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent, phenotype is Pigment red and checkered.\n- If C is absent (all c alleles) and B is present, phenotype is Plain and brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, phenotype is Plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by counting the number of individuals that fit each category.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation is 16 individuals, let's calculate how many fall into each category.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is present (at least one B). \n   - Number of ways to get at least one C: 13 (since all except the 'cc' genotype will have at least one C)\n   - Number of ways to get at least one B: 13\n   - But since each gene is independent, the combined count is 13 * 13 / 16? Wait, no\u2014this approach is incorrect. Instead, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated by subtracting those without C or without B.\n\n   Total individuals: 16\n   Individuals without C: 4 ('cc')\n   Individuals without B: 4 ('BB')\n   Individuals without C and without B: 1 ('cc')\n   Using inclusion-exclusion principle:\n   Number with at least one C or at least one B = Total - Without C - Without B + Without both C and B\n   = 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n   Wait, but this gives the number of individuals with at least one C or at least one B. However, we want individuals with both C and B, so the correct formula is:\n   Number with both C and B = Total - (without C + without B - without both C and B)\n   = 16 - (4 + 4 - 1) = 16 - 7 = 9\n   So, 9 individuals will have both C and B, thus showing both traits: Pigment red and brown.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: This occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is absent (no B alleles, i.e., 'bb').\n   - Number of ways to get at least one C: 13\n   - Number of ways to get bb: 1 (only one 'bb' in F2)\n   - However, since the presence of at least one C is required, the number of individuals with at least one C and bb is 1 (the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This requires C and B to be dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Requires C dominant, B recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Requires c and B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Requires c and B recessive.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. However, since both genes are being considered simultaneously, the calculation isn't straightforward because the presence of one allele affects the others. Instead, we should consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Let's list all possible genotypes for each bird and determine their phenotypes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Plain, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, the number of possible genotypes is limited by the number of alleles. For example, for the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. Similarly for the B locus. But when considering both genes together, the possible genotypes are the combinations of these. However, the actual phenotypic expression depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So, instead of listing all nine possible combinations, let's focus on the phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B), phenotype is Pigment red and Brown.\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b), phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B), phenotype is Plain and Brown.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is absent (b), phenotype is Plain and Checkered.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining how likely each gene is to be dominant. Since each bird is formed by crossing two parents, we can compute the probabilities based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 (first filial generation) will all be CcBb, as previously established. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the proportions for each genotype are 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- For CC: Pigment red (C is dominant), and Brown (B is dominant)\n- For Cc: Pigment red (C dominant), and Checkered (B recessive)\n- For cc: Plain (c dominant), and Brown (B dominant)\n- For cC (same as Cc): Pigment red, Checkered\n- For cc: Plain, Brown\n- For cc: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C genotype) and B is present (any B genotype). In terms of F2, this includes all individuals except those who are cc and bb. So the number of such individuals is (number of CC, Cc, and Cc) minus the cc and bb cases. Since each F2 individual is a gamete from F1 (which is CcBb), the possible combinations are:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4 x 4 = 16 (since each parent contributes 4 gametes).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: All except cc and bb. So 16 - 2 = 14 individuals?\nWait, no\u2014let me correct this. The correct way is to look at each F2 genotype and see what phenotype it expresses.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits, which isn't the case. Wait, no\u2014that approach is flawed because the presence of one allele affects the others. Instead, we should use the formula for independent genes:\n\nProbability of phenotype = product of probabilities for each dominant trait.\n\nSo for Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B must be dominant.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But this indicates that every bird has both traits, which contradicts reality because some birds might lack one trait despite having the other. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed. So the probability of having both traits is indeed 1, but that also implies that all birds have both traits, which can't be true because some birds may lack one trait due to the other being dominant. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it will have both traits. If it has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it'll have pigment red and checkered. If it has c (recessive) and B (dominant), it'll have plain and brown. And if it has c and b, it'll have plain and checkered. So the possible phenotypes are four: RG (pigment red and brown), RC (pigment red and checkered), cB (plain and brown), and cb (plain and checkered). \n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype RG: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But wait, that's not correct because it assumes all individuals have both traits, which isn't possible. Actually, the correct way is to realize that the presence of both dominant alleles leads to both traits. So the probability of having both traits is 1. But that's not accurate because in reality, some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014this is a confusion between the presence of alleles and the traits themselves. Actually, if both genes are dominant, the bird will exhibit both traits. So the probability of having both traits is 1, but that still doesn't explain why some birds might lack one trait unless the other is dominant. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should calculate the probabilities differently.\n\nLet me try this approach: Calculate the probability for each phenotype by considering the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\n1. Phenotype RG (pigment red and brown):\n   - Requires C (dominant) and B (dominant).\n   - Genotype required: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 All these have at least one C and one B.\n   - Number of such genotypes: 4\n   - Since each F2 individual is a combination of two F1 gametes, and each F1 is CcBb, the number of such individuals is (number of ways to get C from one parent and C from the other) times similar for B. Wait, this is getting complicated. Instead, let's remember that the probability of a bird having both traits is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant. Since each gene is inherited independently, P(RG) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But this can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some might lack one. Wait, I'm making a mistake here. The correct approach is to recognize that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the trait. So, for RG, both C and B must be dominant, which is always true for any bird where C and B are dominant. Therefore, the probability is 1, but that's not possible because not all birds can have both traits. Wait, no\u2014all birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they will express both traits. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1, but this still doesn't account for the fact that some birds might have one trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014it's impossible because if a bird has one dominant allele, it will have the corresponding trait. So if a bird has C dominant, it will have pigment red, regardless of B. Similarly, if B is dominant, it will have brown, regardless of C. Therefore, the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if neither C nor B is dominant, i.e., if both are recessive. So the probability of having both traits is 1, and the probability of not having both traits is zero, which makes sense because all birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, hence expressing both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for both traits being present is 100%, and the remaining 0% have either one trait or none. But this contradicts the options given. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits because each gene is present in at least one copy. Therefore, all 16 F2 individuals will have both traits, leading to a 1:0:0:0 phenotypic ratio. But that can't be right because the options don't include 100%:0. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,2,0,0\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nNone of these options suggest a 1:0:0:0 ratio. So clearly, my reasoning is flawed somewhere. Let me reconsider the approach. Perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between the genes. Maybe the presence of one allele masks the other, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expressions are additive, allowing different combinations. Wait, perhaps I should model the possible genotypes and their resulting phenotypes correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or C) and B is present (either B or B), phenotype is Pigment red and Brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent (B), phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered.\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present, phenotype is Plain and Brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, phenotype is Plain and Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are four categories, and their counts depend on the number of F2 individuals that fall into each category.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (Pigment red)\n- 50% Cc (Pigment red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n\nAnd for the B gene:\n\n- 25% BB (Brown)\n- 50% Bb (Brown)\n- 25% bb (Checkered)\n\nHowever, when considering both genes together, the actual phenotypes depend on the combination of these. As before, the only way to have both traits is if both C and B are present. Otherwise, the bird may have one trait or none, depending on which gene is dominant. But according to our previous conclusion, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will have both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals should have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 16 individuals with both traits (RG), and 0 individuals without both traits. But this contradicts the answer choices, indicating that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in the interpretation of the genetic loci. Maybe the two genes interact in a way that certain phenotypes combine rather than simply adding traits. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant allele is not necessarily the same across both genes, but that's not indicated in the problem. Another possibility is that the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to specific phenotypic categories. For instance, if a bird has both C and B dominant, it shows both traits. If it has only one dominant allele, it shows that trait plus the recessive counterpart. But that's not standard practice. Usually, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it exhibits that trait. So, if a bird has both C and B dominant, it exhibits both traits. If it has only C dominant, it exhibits pigment red and brown (assuming B is recessive). If it has only B dominant, it exhibits brown and checkered. If it has neither, it's plain and checkered. So, all F2 individuals would have both traits, leading to a 100% ratio for both traits.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, none have a 1:0:0:0 ratio. This suggests that my analysis is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh! Wait a minute\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive alleles, while the brown is determined by the dominant allele. So, perhaps the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. Wait, but in the context of the problem, the checkered pattern refers to the recessive phenotype, and brown refers to the dominant. So, the phenotype could be described as either \"pigment red and brown\" (if both C and B are present), \"pigment red and checkered\" (if C is present and B is recessive), \"plain and brown\" (if C is recessive and B is dominant), and \"plain and checkered\" (if both are recessive). \n\nNow, considering this, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Occurs when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_). \n   - P(C_) = 1 (since C is dominant in the F1, and F1 is CcBb, so all offspring will have at least one C allele)\n   - P(B_) = 1 (similar logic)\n   - Thus, P(Pigment red and brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n   But this can't be correct because not all F2 individuals will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele ensures the trait is expressed. So, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits, leading to a 100% ratio for both traits. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the presence of one dominant allele leading to the trait, but the interaction between the two genes complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio under the assumption that only one dominant allele leads to the trait, not both. But that would change the approach entirely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is considering the coat color and pigmentation separately. For example, the brown color is expressed if B is present (regardless of C), and checkered if both are recessive. Pigment red is expressed if C is present (regardless of B). Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele), phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent, phenotype is Pigment red and checkered.\n- If C is absent (all c alleles) and B is present, phenotype is Plain and brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, phenotype is Plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by counting the number of individuals that fit each category.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation is 16 individuals, let's calculate how many fall into each category.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is present (at least one B). \n   - Number of ways to get at least one C: 13 (since all except the 'cc' genotype will have at least one C)\n   - Number of ways to get at least one B: 13\n   - But since each gene is independent, the combined count is 13 * 13 / 16? Wait, no\u2014this approach is incorrect. Instead, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated by subtracting those without C or without B.\n\n   Total individuals: 16\n   Individuals without C: 4 ('cc')\n   Individuals without B: 4 ('BB')\n   Individuals without C and without B: 1 ('cc')\n   Using inclusion-exclusion principle:\n   Number with at least one C or at least one B = Total - Without C - Without B + Without both C and B\n   = 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n   Wait, but this gives the number of individuals with at least one C or at least one B. However, we want individuals with both C and B, so the correct formula is:\n   Number with both C and B = Total - (without C + without B - without both C and B)\n   = 16 - (4 + 4 - 1) = 16 - 7 = 9\n   So, 9 individuals will have both C and B, thus showing both traits: Pigment red and brown.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: This occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is absent (no B alleles, i.e., 'bb').\n   - Number of ways to get at least one C: 13\n   - Number of ways to get bb: 1 (only one 'bb' in F2)\n   - However, since the presence of at least one C is required, the number of individuals with at least one C and bb is 1 (the",

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait is absent.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait is absent. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nFirst, the probability of having C (pigment red) is 100% because any dominant allele results in red. Similarly, the probability of having B (brown) is 100%. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because if both C and B are dominant, then both traits are expressed. If either C is recessive or B is recessive, the corresponding trait is absent. So the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B dominant \u2192 both traits expressed\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 only red expressed\nPhenotype C: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 only brown expressed\nPhenotype D: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 neither trait expressed\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Class A (both dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1 (since C is always dominant)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is always dominant)\nSo P(A) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nClass B (only C dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1\nP(b) = 0 (since B is always dominant)\nThus, P(B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nClass C (only B dominant):\n\nP(c) = 0\nP(B) = 1\nThus, P(C) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nClass D (neither dominant):\n\nP(c) = 1\nP(b) = 0\nThus, P(D) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn't exceed 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Let me rethink. Perhaps I misunderstood how the phenotypes are determined. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the corresponding trait being expressed, regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it expresses red or brown. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it expresses brown or checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the genes are separate. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, depending on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it will have both traits\u2014red and brown.\nIf it has C (dominant pigment) but not B (recessive brown), it'll have red and checkered.\nIf it has c (recessive pigment) but has B (dominant brown), it'll have plain and brown.\nAnd if it has neither (c and b), it'll have plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are as previously stated, but their probabilities aren't simply multiplicative because some combinations may not occur. For instance, the presence of C and B both dominant is 100%, as any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment will have red, unless it also has a dominant allele for body color. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C (pigment red) but not B (brown), it will still express red and checkered. Similarly, if it has B (brown) but not C (checkered), it'll have plain and brown. Only if it has both C and B dominant, it'll have both traits\u2014red and brown. So the probabilities are:\n\nP(A) = Probability of having C and B dominant \u2192 1 (since any C or B dominant leads to those traits)\nP(B) = Probability of having C dominant and B recessive \u2192 [P(C) * P(b)] = 1 * 0 = 0\nP(C) = Probability of having C recessive and B dominant \u2192 [P(c) * P(B)] = 1 * 1 = 1\nP(D) = Probability of having both recessive \u2192 [P(c) * P(b)] = 1 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, but that would mean that all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment, so P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 1. This indicates that my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try a different method. Instead of thinking about all possible combinations, consider the actual expression of traits based on dominance. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the expression of that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A: At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 both traits expressed\nPhenotype B: At least one dominant C and at least one recessive B \u2192 only red\nPhenotype C: At least one recessive C and at least one dominant B \u2192 only brown\nPhenotype D: At least one recessive C and at least one recessive B \u2192 only plain\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nP(A) = P(C) + P(B) - P(AB) where AB is the overlap. Wait, no, that's inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, P(A) = P(C \u2228 B) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2227 B)\n\nSimilarly, P(B) = P(C) - P(C \u2227 B)\nP(C) = P(B) - P(C \u2227 B)\nP(D) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) - P(C)\n\nGiven that:\n- P(C) = 1 (since C is dominant in both cases)\n- P(B) = 1 (since B is dominant)\n- P(C \u2227 B) = 1 (since both C and B are always dominant)\n\nThen:\nP(A) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\nP(B) = P(C) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 - 1 = 0\nP(C) = P(B) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 - 1 = 0\nP(D) = 1 - 1 - 0 - 0 = 0\n\nThis still results in all probabilities summing to 1 (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1), which seems odd because it suggests all phenotypes are A, but clearly, some birds wouldn't exhibit certain traits if the other gene is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C (pigment red) and B (brown), it will express both traits. If it has C (pigment red) and not B (brown), it'll express red and checkered. If it has not C (checkered) but has B (brown), it'll express plain and brown. And if it has neither, it'll express plain and checkered.\n\nWait, so the only way to have neither trait expressed is if both genes are recessive, but given that the parents are homozygous for each gene, every bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, every bird will have at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body color. Thus, all birds will have both traits expressed, making Phenotype A the only possibility. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have one trait even if the other is present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for pigment is sufficient to express red, and similarly for body color. So, any bird with at least one dominant pigment allele will have red, and any bird with at least one dominant body color allele will have brown. Therefore, the only time a bird won't have a trait is if it has no dominant alleles for that gene. But since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will inherit at least one dominant allele for each gene, meaning all birds will have both traits expressed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% Phenotype A.\n\nBut that can't be right because the options don't include a 100% ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThat suggests a ratio of 13:12, which doesn't align with my previous conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance isn't such that any dominant allele leads to the same trait. Instead, maybe the presence of dominant C leads to red, and dominant B leads to brown, but without the other dominant allele, the trait is not expressed. For example:\n\n- Pigment red (C) requires at least one dominant C\n- Brown (B) requires at least one dominant B\n- Checkered (c) requires at least one recessive c\n- Plain (b) requires at least one recessive b\n\nIn that case, a bird could have both C and B dominant (Pigment red and Brown), or C dominant and B recessive (Pigment red and Checkered), or C recessive and B dominant (Checkered and Brown), or C recessive and B recessive (Checkered and Checkered).\n\nBut in reality, a bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So, for pigment, if C is present, the bird is red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, the bird is brown. If b is present, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both traits expressed\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 only pigment red\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 only body color brown\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 neither trait\n\nBut according to the parents:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo the F1 would be all CB gametes, leading to the genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n\nEach with a certain probability:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C and C): Pigment red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc (C and c): Pigment red (C dominant) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc (c and c): Plain (c dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc (c and c): Plain (c dominant) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nSince the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nSo when F1 selfs:\n\n- 25% CB x CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% CB x cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% cb x CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% cb x cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb each at 50%. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n        ----------------\n      CB     | CcBb | CcBb\n      cb     | CcBb | ccBB\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% ccBB (phenotype C)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. The Punnett square shows that each parent contributes CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB = CcBb\n- CB x cb = CcBb\n- cb x CB = CcBb\n- cb x cb = ccBB\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- CcBb appears 3 times (from CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB) \u2192 75%\n- ccBB appears once (from cb x cb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this conflicts with the earlier thought process. However, according to the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are 75% CcBb and 25% ccBB. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them match a 3:1 ratio. However, option H is a 5:3 ratio, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12 parts. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, adding to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, adding to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. Option I is 7:5:1:3, adding to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, adding to 12.\n\nWait, but according to the Punnett square analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 75% A (Pigment red and Brown) and 25% C (Plain and Brown). However, the answer options don't provide a 3:1 ratio. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratio considers that when a bird has both dominant traits, it's counted towards one phenotype, while others are counted separately. But that doesn't change the fact that the ratio should be 3:1 in terms of CcBb:CcBb:ccBB, but perhaps the letters are considered differently.\n\nWait, let me double-check the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 A\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 B\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 C\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 D\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes, we have:\n\n- 75% CcBb \u2192 A\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 C\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 75:25, or 3:1. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option H is 5:3, which doesn't add up to 16, so that's unlikely. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. None seem to match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question counts the number of birds with each phenotype, not just the ratio. If there are 16 birds in total (assuming each F2 generation has 16), then:\n\n- 75% of 16 \u2192 12 birds with A (Pigment red and Brown)\n- 25% of 16 \u2192 4 birds with C (Plain and Brown)\n\nSo the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the count is different.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\n- Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 16 birds, 4 each for all phenotypes\n- Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 16 birds, 12 A, 2 B, 2 C, 0 D\n- Option H: 5:3 \u2192 8 vs 4\n- Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 12 vs 4\n- Option I:7:5:1:3\u219216 birds, 7+5+1+3=16\n- Option K: Not listed, but likely similar issues\n- Option L: Not listed\n- Option M: Not listed\n- Option N: Not listed\n- Option O: Not listed\n- Option P: Not listed\n- Option Q: Not listed\n- Option R: Not listed\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". Summing these gives 6+2+6+2=16 birds. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is presented as 6:2:6:2, which is 3:1:3:1. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of checkered and plain birds, not the full phenotypes. But no, the question specifically mentions checkered and plain. Let me see:\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Which matches option P: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This totals 16 birds. Now, what's the phenotypic ratio?\n\nEach group corresponds to a phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (CR): 6 birds\n- Checkered brown (CB): 2 birds\n- Plain red (PR): 6 birds\n- Plain brown (PB): 2 birds",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait is absent. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each class.\n\nFirst, the probability of having C (pigment red) is 100% because any dominant allele results in red. Similarly, the probability of having B (brown) is 100%. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because if both C and B are dominant, then both traits are expressed. If either C is recessive or B is recessive, the corresponding trait is absent. So the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B dominant \u2192 both traits expressed\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 only red expressed\nPhenotype C: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 only brown expressed\nPhenotype D: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 neither trait expressed\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Class A (both dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1 (since C is always dominant)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is always dominant)\nSo P(A) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nClass B (only C dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1\nP(b) = 0 (since B is always dominant)\nThus, P(B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nClass C (only B dominant):\n\nP(c) = 0\nP(B) = 1\nThus, P(C) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nClass D (neither dominant):\n\nP(c) = 1\nP(b) = 0\nThus, P(D) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0% chance\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn't exceed 100%. Clearly, something is wrong here. Let me rethink. Perhaps I misunderstood how the phenotypes are determined. Maybe the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the corresponding trait being expressed, regardless of the other gene. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it expresses red or brown. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color, it expresses brown or checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the genes are separate. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, depending on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it will have both traits\u2014red and brown.\nIf it has C (dominant pigment) but not B (recessive brown), it'll have red and checkered.\nIf it has c (recessive pigment) but has B (dominant brown), it'll have plain and brown.\nAnd if it has neither (c and b), it'll have plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are as previously stated, but their probabilities aren't simply multiplicative because some combinations may not occur. For instance, the presence of C and B both dominant is 100%, as any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment will have red, unless it also has a dominant allele for body color. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C (pigment red) but not B (brown), it will still express red and checkered. Similarly, if it has B (brown) but not C (checkered), it'll have plain and brown. Only if it has both C and B dominant, it'll have both traits\u2014red and brown. So the probabilities are:\n\nP(A) = Probability of having C and B dominant \u2192 1 (since any C or B dominant leads to those traits)\nP(B) = Probability of having C dominant and B recessive \u2192 [P(C) * P(b)] = 1 * 0 = 0\nP(C) = Probability of having C recessive and B dominant \u2192 [P(c) * P(B)] = 1 * 1 = 1\nP(D) = Probability of having both recessive \u2192 [P(c) * P(b)] = 1 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, but that would mean that all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment, so P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 1. This indicates that my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try a different method. Instead of thinking about all possible combinations, consider the actual expression of traits based on dominance. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the expression of that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype A: At least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 both traits expressed\nPhenotype B: At least one dominant C and at least one recessive B \u2192 only red\nPhenotype C: At least one recessive C and at least one dominant B \u2192 only brown\nPhenotype D: At least one recessive C and at least one recessive B \u2192 only plain\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nP(A) = P(C) + P(B) - P(AB) where AB is the overlap. Wait, no, that's inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, P(A) = P(C \u2228 B) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2227 B)\n\nSimilarly, P(B) = P(C) - P(C \u2227 B)\nP(C) = P(B) - P(C \u2227 B)\nP(D) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) - P(C)\n\nGiven that:\n- P(C) = 1 (since C is dominant in both cases)\n- P(B) = 1 (since B is dominant)\n- P(C \u2227 B) = 1 (since both C and B are always dominant)\n\nThen:\nP(A) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\nP(B) = P(C) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 - 1 = 0\nP(C) = P(B) - P(C \u2227 B) = 1 - 1 = 0\nP(D) = 1 - 1 - 0 - 0 = 0\n\nThis still results in all probabilities summing to 1 (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1), which seems odd because it suggests all phenotypes are A, but clearly, some birds wouldn't exhibit certain traits if the other gene is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C (pigment red) and B (brown), it will express both traits. If it has C (pigment red) and not B (brown), it'll express red and checkered. If it has not C (checkered) but has B (brown), it'll express plain and brown. And if it has neither, it'll express plain and checkered.\n\nWait, so the only way to have neither trait expressed is if both genes are recessive, but given that the parents are homozygous for each gene, every bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, every bird will have at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body color. Thus, all birds will have both traits expressed, making Phenotype A the only possibility. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have one trait even if the other is present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for pigment is sufficient to express red, and similarly for body color. So, any bird with at least one dominant pigment allele will have red, and any bird with at least one dominant body color allele will have brown. Therefore, the only time a bird won't have a trait is if it has no dominant alleles for that gene. But since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will inherit at least one dominant allele for each gene, meaning all birds will have both traits expressed. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% Phenotype A.\n\nBut that can't be right because the options don't include a 100% ratio. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThat suggests a ratio of 13:12, which doesn't align with my previous conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance isn't such that any dominant allele leads to the same trait. Instead, maybe the presence of dominant C leads to red, and dominant B leads to brown, but without the other dominant allele, the trait is not expressed. For example:\n\n- Pigment red (C) requires at least one dominant C\n- Brown (B) requires at least one dominant B\n- Checkered (c) requires at least one recessive c\n- Plain (b) requires at least one recessive b\n\nIn that case, a bird could have both C and B dominant (Pigment red and Brown), or C dominant and B recessive (Pigment red and Checkered), or C recessive and B dominant (Checkered and Brown), or C recessive and B recessive (Checkered and Checkered).\n\nBut in reality, a bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So, for pigment, if C is present, the bird is red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, the bird is brown. If b is present, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both traits expressed\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 only pigment red\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 only body color brown\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 neither trait\n\nBut according to the parents:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo the F1 would be all CB gametes, leading to the genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n\nEach with a certain probability:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C and C): Pigment red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc (C and c): Pigment red (C dominant) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc (c and c): Plain (c dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc (c and c): Plain (c dominant) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nSince the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nSo when F1 selfs:\n\n- 25% CB x CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% CB x cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% cb x CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- 25% cb x cb \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb each at 50%. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n        ----------------\n      CB     | CcBb | CcBb\n      cb     | CcBb | ccBB\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% CcBb (phenotype A)\n- 25% ccBB (phenotype C)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. The Punnett square shows that each parent contributes CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB = CcBb\n- CB x cb = CcBb\n- cb x CB = CcBb\n- cb x cb = ccBB\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- CcBb appears 3 times (from CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB) \u2192 75%\n- ccBB appears once (from cb x cb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this conflicts with the earlier thought process. However, according to the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are 75% CcBb and 25% ccBB. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them match a 3:1 ratio. However, option H is a 5:3 ratio, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12 parts. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, adding to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which adds to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, adding to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4, adding to 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, adding to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding to 16. Option I is 7:5:1:3, adding to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, adding to 12.\n\nWait, but according to the Punnett square analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 75% A (Pigment red and Brown) and 25% C (Plain and Brown). However, the answer options don't provide a 3:1 ratio. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratio considers that when a bird has both dominant traits, it's counted towards one phenotype, while others are counted separately. But that doesn't change the fact that the ratio should be 3:1 in terms of CcBb:CcBb:ccBB, but perhaps the letters are considered differently.\n\nWait, let me double-check the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 A\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 B\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 C\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 D\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes, we have:\n\n- 75% CcBb \u2192 A\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 C\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 75:25, or 3:1. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, option H is 5:3, which doesn't add up to 16, so that's unlikely. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. None seem to match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question counts the number of birds with each phenotype, not just the ratio. If there are 16 birds in total (assuming each F2 generation has 16), then:\n\n- 75% of 16 \u2192 12 birds with A (Pigment red and Brown)\n- 25% of 16 \u2192 4 birds with C (Plain and Brown)\n\nSo the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the count is different.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\n- Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 16 birds, 4 each for all phenotypes\n- Option G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 16 birds, 12 A, 2 B, 2 C, 0 D\n- Option H: 5:3 \u2192 8 vs 4\n- Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 12 vs 4\n- Option I:7:5:1:3\u219216 birds, 7+5+1+3=16\n- Option K: Not listed, but likely similar issues\n- Option L: Not listed\n- Option M: Not listed\n- Option N: Not listed\n- Option O: Not listed\n- Option P: Not listed\n- Option Q: Not listed\n- Option R: Not listed\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". Summing these gives 6+2+6+2=16 birds. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is presented as 6:2:6:2, which is 3:1:3:1. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of checkered and plain birds, not the full phenotypes. But no, the question specifically mentions checkered and plain. Let me see:\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Which matches option P: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This totals 16 birds. Now, what's the phenotypic ratio?\n\nEach group corresponds to a phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (CR): 6 birds\n- Checkered brown (CB): 2 birds\n- Plain red (PR): 6 birds\n- Plain brown (PB): 2 birds",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, having one dominant allele may not always ensure the presence of both traits, depending on the interaction.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, having one dominant allele may not always ensure the presence of both traits, depending on the interaction. But in this case, since both traits are determined independently, every bird that has at least one dominant allele for each gene will have both traits expressed. However, wait\u2014that\u2019s not entirely accurate. For example, a bird could have a dominant C and a recessive c, resulting in red pigment but plain color. Similarly, a bird with a dominant B and a recessive b will have brown color but checkered pigment. So the phenotypes are combinations where either or both traits are expressed. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 1 (since any C results in red). The probability of having brown (B) is also 1 (since any B results in brown). Therefore, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1. But that seems too high. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct because a bird with C and B will have both traits, but a bird without C or B won\u2019t have either trait. So, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Each trait is determined independently, so the probability that a bird has both traits is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present. However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the presence of the other, the combined probability is indeed the product. But in reality, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to display the corresponding trait. So, for a bird to have pigment red and brown, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. The same logic applies to the other phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's consider the possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C: pigment red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each gene, we can list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nGene C:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nGene B:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are: Checkered Red, Plain Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll use the Punnett square method. \n\nThe F1 generation from the cross of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. Each F1 bird will produce gametes with a 50% chance of carrying CB, Cb, cB, or cb. Since the parents are homozygous, each gamete carries one allele from each gene.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb or Cb + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene:\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0 (since both parents are cc)\nSimilarly,\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0 (since both parents are bb)\n\nTherefore, the only possible phenotypes are those that require at least one dominant allele for each gene. But since all F1 birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene (because they're all CcBb), all F2 birds will exhibit all possible phenotypes. However, wait\u2014that can't be right because some birds might lack one trait but have another due to incomplete dominance or other factors. But in this case, both genes are dominant-recessive, and each bird expresses both traits if they have at least one dominant allele for each. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both Pigment red and Brown, making them Checkered Red. That doesn't seem right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will express both traits. So all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown, making them Checkered Red. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the presence of one dominant allele for each gene ensures the presence of both traits. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown, leading to Checkered Red. But then why does the question mention four phenotypes? Maybe I've misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the question is considering each gene separately, but the actual phenotype combines both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering each gene's contribution, but the overall phenotype is a combination of both. In that case, the four phenotypes would occur with certain probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the calculation. Each gene has a 50% chance of passing on its allele, so the probability of each combination is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. However, since both genes are required for each trait, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the gametes that contribute to that phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express both traits, every F2 bird will be Checkered Red. But that doesn't align with the answer choices provided, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on one trait per bird, but the description says \"phenotypes\" which include both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird can have different combinations regardless of the presence of the other trait. But given that both traits are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present for each gene, all F2 birds would be Checkered Red, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. This suggests that my initial understanding is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simplifying and treating each gene independently, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. Let me try recalculating under this assumption.\n\nIf each gene contributes independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nFor Example:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis again suggests all phenotypes are Pigment red and Brown, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must be missing something. Perhaps the problem is considering each bird's expression based on the presence of each trait individually, rather than both. But that wouldn't make much sense biologically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of dominant vs recessive alleles without necessarily expressing both traits, but that would complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is treating each bird as having two separate traits, each governed by a separate gene, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of each trait's expression. In that case, each bird can be classified into one of four categories based on the presence of pigment red, brown, plain, and checkered. However, some of these categories might overlap in terms of traits, reducing the number of distinct phenotypes. For instance, a bird with both pigment red and brown would be Checkered Red, while a bird with pigment red and plain would be Plain Red, and similarly for the others.\n\nIn that case, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Red (both traits expressed)\n2. Plain Red (pigment red only)\n3. Checkered Brown (brown only)\n4. Plain Brown (brown only)\n\nWait, but a bird can have both traits, so the fourth category shouldn't exist. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the presence of pigment red and brown would mean both traits are expressed, making it Checkered Red. Similarly, if a bird has pigment red and plain, it would be Plain Red. If it has brown and plain, it's Plain Brown. And if it has both traits, it's Checkered Red. Wait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have both Checkered Red and Checkered Brown simultaneously. Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Red (pigment red and brown)\n2. Plain Red (pigment red only)\n3. Plain Brown (brown only)\n4. Checkered Brown (brown only)\n\nBut now, how many birds would fall into each category?\n\nSince each bird's genotype determines the phenotype, the probabilities are as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red (C):\n  - CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n  - cc \u2192 Plain\n- For Brown (B):\n  - BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n  - bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C and b \u2192 Red and Checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, the probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- C (Red) and B (Brown): (1/2)(1) * (1/2)(1) = 1/4\n- C and b: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- c and B: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- c and b: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nHowever, in reality, the presence of one trait doesn't preclude the other unless there's a genetic interaction. Assuming independent assortment, all four combinations are equally likely, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Brown, and 25% Checkered Brown. Adding up all these gives 100%.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is for pigment color (red), and c is for plain color. So, a bird with at least one C allele has red pigment, and at least one c allele has plain color. Similarly, B is for brown color (dominant), b is for checkered. So, a bird with at least one B allele has brown, and at least one b allele has checkered.\n\nThe F2 generation would be the result of selfing the F1 (CcBb). Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being produced.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cB or Cb + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because each F1 bird can produce multiple gametes. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 individuals are CcBb, so each can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nThe Punnett square would then look like this:\n\n```\n          | CB    | Cb     | cB     | cb\n----------|--------|--------|--------|-----\n        CB   | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F1 individuals are CcBb, so each gamete is CcBb, and the Punnett square should reflect the cross of F1 x F1. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so the Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n           | Cc    | Cc    | Cc    | Cc\n-----------|--------|--------|--------|-----\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n```\n\nEach cell represents the F2 genotype, which is a combination of one allele from each parent. So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from Cc x Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x Cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- bb (from bb x bb)\n\nBut wait, each F1 bird is CcBb, so the Punnett square would involve crossing CcBb with CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (only if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- cc (only if both parents contribute c)\n- bb (only if both parents contribute b)\n\nNow, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc \u2192Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- bb \u2192Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. Using the Punnett square above, each cell corresponds to a specific genotype. Let's count the occurrences:\n\n- CC: appears 1 time\n- Cc: appears 4 times\n- cc: appears 1 time\n- bb: appears 4 times\n\nTotal of 10 cells, so:\n\n- CC: 1/10 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc: 4/10 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc: 1/10 \u2192 Plain Brown\n- bb: 4/10 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nAdding up, Checkered Red (1+4)/10 = 5/10, Plain Brown (1)/10, Checkered Brown (4)/10. Wait, that adds up to 10 parts, but according to the counts, it's 1+4+1+4=10. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 5/10\n- Plain Brown: 1/10\n- Checkered Brown: 4/10\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered Red : Plain Brown : Checkered Brown = 5 : 1 : 4, which simplifies to 5:1:4. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options provided.\n\nLooking at the answer options:\n\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:5\n\nNone of these match the 5:1:4 ratio I calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the counts were:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 4\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 4\n\nTotal: 10\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC and Cc \u2192 1 + 4 = 5 \u2192 5/10\n- Plain Brown: cc \u2192 1 \u2192 1/10\n- Checkered Brown: bb \u2192 4 \u2192 4/10\n\nSo, the ratio is 5:1:4.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me review the problem statement again to see if I interpreted the question correctly. It mentions the checkered pattern, which is controlled by gene C, and plain color by c. Pigments are determined by B and b. The adi hybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the question says the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen these two are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. However, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the order of the genes, but I think the approach remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the phenotype in terms of each trait independently, leading to four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Plain Red, Checkered Brown,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, having one dominant allele may not always ensure the presence of both traits, depending on the interaction. But in this case, since both traits are determined independently, every bird that has at least one dominant allele for each gene will have both traits expressed. However, wait\u2014that\u2019s not entirely accurate. For example, a bird could have a dominant C and a recessive c, resulting in red pigment but plain color. Similarly, a bird with a dominant B and a recessive b will have brown color but checkered pigment. So the phenotypes are combinations where either or both traits are expressed. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 1 (since any C results in red). The probability of having brown (B) is also 1 (since any B results in brown). Therefore, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1. But that seems too high. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct because a bird with C and B will have both traits, but a bird without C or B won\u2019t have either trait. So, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Each trait is determined independently, so the probability that a bird has both traits is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present. However, since the presence of one trait doesn't affect the presence of the other, the combined probability is indeed the product. But in reality, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to display the corresponding trait. So, for a bird to have pigment red and brown, it must have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. The same logic applies to the other phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's consider the possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C: pigment red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, for each gene, we can list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nGene C:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nGene B:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are: Checkered Red, Plain Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll use the Punnett square method. \n\nThe F1 generation from the cross of CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. Each F1 bird will produce gametes with a 50% chance of carrying CB, Cb, cB, or cb. Since the parents are homozygous, each gamete carries one allele from each gene.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb or Cb + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So for each gene:\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0 (since both parents are cc)\nSimilarly,\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0 (since both parents are bb)\n\nTherefore, the only possible phenotypes are those that require at least one dominant allele for each gene. But since all F1 birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene (because they're all CcBb), all F2 birds will exhibit all possible phenotypes. However, wait\u2014that can't be right because some birds might lack one trait but have another due to incomplete dominance or other factors. But in this case, both genes are dominant-recessive, and each bird expresses both traits if they have at least one dominant allele for each. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both Pigment red and Brown, making them Checkered Red. That doesn't seem right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will express both traits. So all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown, making them Checkered Red. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the presence of one dominant allele for each gene ensures the presence of both traits. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown, leading to Checkered Red. But then why does the question mention four phenotypes? Maybe I've misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the question is considering each gene separately, but the actual phenotype combines both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering each gene's contribution, but the overall phenotype is a combination of both. In that case, the four phenotypes would occur with certain probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the calculation. Each gene has a 50% chance of passing on its allele, so the probability of each combination is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. However, since both genes are required for each trait, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the gametes that contribute to that phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express both traits, every F2 bird will be Checkered Red. But that doesn't align with the answer choices provided, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on one trait per bird, but the description says \"phenotypes\" which include both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird can have different combinations regardless of the presence of the other trait. But given that both traits are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present for each gene, all F2 birds would be Checkered Red, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. This suggests that my initial understanding is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simplifying and treating each gene independently, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. Let me try recalculating under this assumption.\n\nIf each gene contributes independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being present.\n\nFor Example:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis again suggests all phenotypes are Pigment red and Brown, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must be missing something. Perhaps the problem is considering each bird's expression based on the presence of each trait individually, rather than both. But that wouldn't make much sense biologically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of dominant vs recessive alleles without necessarily expressing both traits, but that would complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is treating each bird as having two separate traits, each governed by a separate gene, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of each trait's expression. In that case, each bird can be classified into one of four categories based on the presence of pigment red, brown, plain, and checkered. However, some of these categories might overlap in terms of traits, reducing the number of distinct phenotypes. For instance, a bird with both pigment red and brown would be Checkered Red, while a bird with pigment red and plain would be Plain Red, and similarly for the others.\n\nIn that case, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Red (both traits expressed)\n2. Plain Red (pigment red only)\n3. Checkered Brown (brown only)\n4. Plain Brown (brown only)\n\nWait, but a bird can have both traits, so the fourth category shouldn't exist. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, the presence of pigment red and brown would mean both traits are expressed, making it Checkered Red. Similarly, if a bird has pigment red and plain, it would be Plain Red. If it has brown and plain, it's Plain Brown. And if it has both traits, it's Checkered Red. Wait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have both Checkered Red and Checkered Brown simultaneously. Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered Red (pigment red and brown)\n2. Plain Red (pigment red only)\n3. Plain Brown (brown only)\n4. Checkered Brown (brown only)\n\nBut now, how many birds would fall into each category?\n\nSince each bird's genotype determines the phenotype, the probabilities are as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red (C):\n  - CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n  - cc \u2192 Plain\n- For Brown (B):\n  - BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n  - bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C and b \u2192 Red and Checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, the probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- C (Red) and B (Brown): (1/2)(1) * (1/2)(1) = 1/4\n- C and b: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- c and B: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n- c and b: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nHowever, in reality, the presence of one trait doesn't preclude the other unless there's a genetic interaction. Assuming independent assortment, all four combinations are equally likely, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Brown, and 25% Checkered Brown. Adding up all these gives 100%.\n\nBut looking back at the answer choices, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is for pigment color (red), and c is for plain color. So, a bird with at least one C allele has red pigment, and at least one c allele has plain color. Similarly, B is for brown color (dominant), b is for checkered. So, a bird with at least one B allele has brown, and at least one b allele has checkered.\n\nThe F2 generation would be the result of selfing the F1 (CcBb). Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being produced.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cB or Cb + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because each F1 bird can produce multiple gametes. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 individuals are CcBb, so each can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nThe Punnett square would then look like this:\n\n```\n          | CB    | Cb     | cB     | cb\n----------|--------|--------|--------|-----\n        CB   | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n          Bb    | CcBb  | CcBb   | CcBb   | CcBb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F1 individuals are CcBb, so each gamete is CcBb, and the Punnett square should reflect the cross of F1 x F1. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so the Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n```\n           | Cc    | Cc    | Cc    | Cc\n-----------|--------|--------|--------|-----\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n         Bb    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n```\n\nEach cell represents the F2 genotype, which is a combination of one allele from each parent. So, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from Cc x Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x Cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- bb (from bb x bb)\n\nBut wait, each F1 bird is CcBb, so the Punnett square would involve crossing CcBb with CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (only if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- cc (only if both parents contribute c)\n- bb (only if both parents contribute b)\n\nNow, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc \u2192Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- bb \u2192Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. Using the Punnett square above, each cell corresponds to a specific genotype. Let's count the occurrences:\n\n- CC: appears 1 time\n- Cc: appears 4 times\n- cc: appears 1 time\n- bb: appears 4 times\n\nTotal of 10 cells, so:\n\n- CC: 1/10 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc: 4/10 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc: 1/10 \u2192 Plain Brown\n- bb: 4/10 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nAdding up, Checkered Red (1+4)/10 = 5/10, Plain Brown (1)/10, Checkered Brown (4)/10. Wait, that adds up to 10 parts, but according to the counts, it's 1+4+1+4=10. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 5/10\n- Plain Brown: 1/10\n- Checkered Brown: 4/10\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered Red : Plain Brown : Checkered Brown = 5 : 1 : 4, which simplifies to 5:1:4. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options provided.\n\nLooking at the answer options:\n\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:5\n\nNone of these match the 5:1:4 ratio I calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the counts were:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 4\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 4\n\nTotal: 10\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC and Cc \u2192 1 + 4 = 5 \u2192 5/10\n- Plain Brown: cc \u2192 1 \u2192 1/10\n- Checkered Brown: bb \u2192 4 \u2192 4/10\n\nSo, the ratio is 5:1:4.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me review the problem statement again to see if I interpreted the question correctly. It mentions the checkered pattern, which is controlled by gene C, and plain color by c. Pigments are determined by B and b. The adi hybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the question says the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen these two are crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. However, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the order of the genes, but I think the approach remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers the phenotype in terms of each trait independently, leading to four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Plain Red, Checkered Brown,",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant, it'll have none. Wait, no\u2014wait, the description says that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. Therefore, a bird could have both traits (red and brown), one trait (either red or brown), or none (but wait, checkered is recessive, so if both genes are recessive, the bird would be checkered. But in our case, the parents are CC BB (so both C and B are dominant) and cc bb (both recessive). Therefore, all F2 birds will inherit both dominant alleles for pigment and both dominant alleles for color, leading to both traits being expressed. Wait, that can't be right because the options given don't reflect that. Let me double-check the problem statement. Oh, wait! The problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So a bird could have either pigment red and/or body brown, depending on the alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both traits expressed.\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 only pigment red.\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 only body brown.\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 neither trait.\n\nWait, but according to the parents, the F1 would be CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 would have all possible combinations where C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown). Because both parents are homozygous for the dominant and recessive alleles respectively. So the F2 would all have at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. But that contradicts the phenotypic ratios given in the options. Let me see the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 summing to 16\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 12\nOption K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nHmm, most options sum to 16, except option J which sums to 12. But according to my earlier reasoning, all F2 birds would have both traits expressed, leading to four phenotypes with certain counts. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. So, for the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (color):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 0\n\nTherefore, every bird in the F2 generation will have both traits expressed, resulting in four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the number of birds in each category depends on the probability of each combination. Since both genes are fully dominant, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled by the number of possible gametes)\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles. Since both genes are fully dominant, every bird will have both traits. Therefore, all four phenotypes exist, each with specific counts based on the possible gametes.\n\nLet me consider how many ways each phenotype can occur. Each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so all four phenotypes are present in the F2 generation.\n\nTo find the count for each phenotype, we need to determine the number of possible combinations of alleles that lead to each phenotype. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires at least one C and one B allele. The possible gametes contributing to this phenotype are CB and BC. From the F1, which is CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So in the F2, the possible offspring will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB (from Cc and Bb) \u2192 CcBb (all dominant)\n- cb (from Cc and bb) \u2192 Ccbb (only pigment red)\n- CB (from cc and Bb) \u2192 ccBb (only body brown)\n- cb (from cc and bb) \u2192 ccbb (no traits)\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that's not correct. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations, including those where both genes are recessive. So the F2 will have four phenotypes, each with a certain number of individuals. To find the exact counts, we can use the Punnett square approach.\n\nThe Punnett square for F1 x F1 (CcBb x CcBb) will have the following combinations:\n\n- Cc x Cc: gives CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus.\n- Bb x Bb: gives BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus.\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are combinations of these, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Dominant (C): pigment red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C dominant and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (checkered)\n2. C dominant and B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive and B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. C recessive and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of individuals in each phenotype depends on the number of ways each combination can occur. For each gene, the probability of dominant is 1, and recessive is 0, as per the parents.\n\nHowever, let me compute the actual counts. Since all F2 birds have both traits expressed, all four phenotypes are present. The number of individuals in each phenotype can be determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene. But since both genes are fully dominant, the probabilities simplify.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 1 (C dominant, B dominant)\n  Number of individuals = (number of C dominant gametes) * (number of B dominant gametes) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the total?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating it. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles. Since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all four phenotypes are represented.\n\nBut the key is that each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on which alleles are dominant. So the distribution among the four phenotypes will depend on the number of possible allele combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, the number of individuals in each phenotype is proportional to the number of ways that combination can occur. For example, to get Pigment red and brown, the bird must receive at least one C and one B allele. Similarly for the others.\n\nLet me calculate the number of individuals for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each parent has 4 gametes, so 4x4=16).\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 All 16 birds have this phenotype.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, so all four phenotypes exist. But looking back at the options, the correct answer isn't matching this conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when they mate, the F1 is CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, F1 x F1 would indeed produce 16 F2 offspring. Each F2 bird inherits two alleles for each gene from F1. For the C locus, each F2 bird has a 50% chance of getting C or c. Same for the B locus. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination is equally likely (25% for each of the four possible C and B combinations). So the F2 will have 16 birds:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%): C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%): c (plain), B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cC (50%): c (plain), B recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but CcBb is the same as Cc and Bb. So the F2 will include all these possibilities. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: All C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain and checkered: c and b\n\nEach of these four phenotypes exists, and their counts are as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Plain and brown: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Plain and checkered: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nWait, but this would mean all four phenotypes have equal counts, each occurring 4 times. But none of the options reflect this. Let me re-examine the problem statement again. Oh wait\u2014the problem mentions a dihybrid cross, but the parents are homozygous. In this case, all F2 will have both traits expressed, leading to equal counts for all four phenotypes. However, the options do not have such an outcome. Perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CC BB, CcBb, ccBb, ccbb. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird will have one copy of CC, Cc, cc, and BB, Bb, bb. But wait, that's incorrect. Each F2 bird receives two alleles for each gene from F1. So for the C locus, half the F2 will have C (p=1), and half will have c (p=0). Similarly for the B locus. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (C)(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled by the number of possible gametes)\nWait, no\u2014since each gene is independent, the probability is simply the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\nP(pigment red) = 1 (since any C leads to red)\nP(brown) = 1 (any B leads to brown)\nP(checkered) = 0 (since c is recessive, no checkered)\nP(plain) = 0 (since c is recessive, no plain)\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes exist in the F2 generation. However, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, which may imply that some phenotypes are absent due to viability or selection against them. But the problem doesn't mention anything about survival or other factors, so presumably all phenotypes are viable.\n\nIf all four phenotypes are present, each with 4 birds (assuming 16 total), then the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nWait, so F and K both suggest a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but only K lists them as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our analysis, all four phenotypes are present. However, in reality, in a dihybrid cross with both genes fully dominant, all four phenotypes should appear. But none of the options perfectly match this unless perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the F2 generation. Each F2 bird is a heterozygote for both genes, so their phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. Since both genes are dominant, all F2 birds will exhibit both traits. Thus, each phenotype should have an equal number of birds. With 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. Therefore, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4. However, looking at the options, F and K both represent 4:4:4:4, but K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" Wait, no\u2014the options list different names, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the names.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that \"checkered\" is recessive (c), and \"plain\" is dominant (C). So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will have both traits expressed. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes should occur with equal frequency. So the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Looking at the options, F and K both represent a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but they name the phenotypes differently. Option F uses \"checkered,\" while K uses \"plain.\" But according to the problem, \"checkered\" is recessive (c), and \"plain\" is dominant (C). So the correct phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to option F or K, but K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" Wait, no\u2014the problem states that \"checkered\" is recessive, so the third phenotype is plain-brown, and the fourth is plain-checkered.\n\nBut according to the options, F and K have different phenotypes. F has \"checkered\" as one phenotype, and K has \"plain\" as one phenotype. So, perhaps the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, corresponding to the four phenotypes listed in option F and K, regardless of the naming convention. Therefore, the correct answer would be either F or K, but since the user probably expects the naming to match the letters, perhaps F is the intended answer as it lists the four phenotypes in order, whereas K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the inheritance patterns.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant, it'll have none. Wait, no\u2014wait, the description says that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. Therefore, a bird could have both traits (red and brown), one trait (either red or brown), or none (but wait, checkered is recessive, so if both genes are recessive, the bird would be checkered. But in our case, the parents are CC BB (so both C and B are dominant) and cc bb (both recessive). Therefore, all F2 birds will inherit both dominant alleles for pigment and both dominant alleles for color, leading to both traits being expressed. Wait, that can't be right because the options given don't reflect that. Let me double-check the problem statement. Oh, wait! The problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So a bird could have either pigment red and/or body brown, depending on the alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both traits expressed.\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 only pigment red.\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 only body brown.\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 neither trait.\n\nWait, but according to the parents, the F1 would be CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 would have all possible combinations where C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown). Because both parents are homozygous for the dominant and recessive alleles respectively. So the F2 would all have at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. But that contradicts the phenotypic ratios given in the options. Let me see the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 summing to 16\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 12\nOption K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nHmm, most options sum to 16, except option J which sums to 12. But according to my earlier reasoning, all F2 birds would have both traits expressed, leading to four phenotypes with certain counts. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. So, for the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (color):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 0\n\nTherefore, every bird in the F2 generation will have both traits expressed, resulting in four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the number of birds in each category depends on the probability of each combination. Since both genes are fully dominant, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled by the number of possible gametes)\nWait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles. Since both genes are fully dominant, every bird will have both traits. Therefore, all four phenotypes exist, each with specific counts based on the possible gametes.\n\nLet me consider how many ways each phenotype can occur. Each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so all four phenotypes are present in the F2 generation.\n\nTo find the count for each phenotype, we need to determine the number of possible combinations of alleles that lead to each phenotype. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires at least one C and one B allele. The possible gametes contributing to this phenotype are CB and BC. From the F1, which is CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So in the F2, the possible offspring will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB (from Cc and Bb) \u2192 CcBb (all dominant)\n- cb (from Cc and bb) \u2192 Ccbb (only pigment red)\n- CB (from cc and Bb) \u2192 ccBb (only body brown)\n- cb (from cc and bb) \u2192 ccbb (no traits)\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that's not correct. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations, including those where both genes are recessive. So the F2 will have four phenotypes, each with a certain number of individuals. To find the exact counts, we can use the Punnett square approach.\n\nThe Punnett square for F1 x F1 (CcBb x CcBb) will have the following combinations:\n\n- Cc x Cc: gives CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus.\n- Bb x Bb: gives BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus.\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are combinations of these, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Dominant (C): pigment red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C dominant and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (checkered)\n2. C dominant and B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive and B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. C recessive and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of individuals in each phenotype depends on the number of ways each combination can occur. For each gene, the probability of dominant is 1, and recessive is 0, as per the parents.\n\nHowever, let me compute the actual counts. Since all F2 birds have both traits expressed, all four phenotypes are present. The number of individuals in each phenotype can be determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene. But since both genes are fully dominant, the probabilities simplify.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 1 (C dominant, B dominant)\n  Number of individuals = (number of C dominant gametes) * (number of B dominant gametes) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the total?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating it. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles. Since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all four phenotypes are represented.\n\nBut the key is that each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on which alleles are dominant. So the distribution among the four phenotypes will depend on the number of possible allele combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, the number of individuals in each phenotype is proportional to the number of ways that combination can occur. For example, to get Pigment red and brown, the bird must receive at least one C and one B allele. Similarly for the others.\n\nLet me calculate the number of individuals for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each parent has 4 gametes, so 4x4=16).\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 All 16 birds have this phenotype.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, so all four phenotypes exist. But looking back at the options, the correct answer isn't matching this conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So when they mate, the F1 is CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, F1 x F1 would indeed produce 16 F2 offspring. Each F2 bird inherits two alleles for each gene from F1. For the C locus, each F2 bird has a 50% chance of getting C or c. Same for the B locus. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination is equally likely (25% for each of the four possible C and B combinations). So the F2 will have 16 birds:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%): C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%): c (plain), B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cC (50%): c (plain), B recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but CcBb is the same as Cc and Bb. So the F2 will include all these possibilities. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: All C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant\n- Plain and checkered: c and b\n\nEach of these four phenotypes exists, and their counts are as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Plain and brown: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Plain and checkered: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nWait, but this would mean all four phenotypes have equal counts, each occurring 4 times. But none of the options reflect this. Let me re-examine the problem statement again. Oh wait\u2014the problem mentions a dihybrid cross, but the parents are homozygous. In this case, all F2 will have both traits expressed, leading to equal counts for all four phenotypes. However, the options do not have such an outcome. Perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CC BB, CcBb, ccBb, ccbb. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird will have one copy of CC, Cc, cc, and BB, Bb, bb. But wait, that's incorrect. Each F2 bird receives two alleles for each gene from F1. So for the C locus, half the F2 will have C (p=1), and half will have c (p=0). Similarly for the B locus. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (C)(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled by the number of possible gametes)\nWait, no\u2014since each gene is independent, the probability is simply the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\nP(pigment red) = 1 (since any C leads to red)\nP(brown) = 1 (any B leads to brown)\nP(checkered) = 0 (since c is recessive, no checkered)\nP(plain) = 0 (since c is recessive, no plain)\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes exist in the F2 generation. However, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, which may imply that some phenotypes are absent due to viability or selection against them. But the problem doesn't mention anything about survival or other factors, so presumably all phenotypes are viable.\n\nIf all four phenotypes are present, each with 4 birds (assuming 16 total), then the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nWait, so F and K both suggest a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but only K lists them as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our analysis, all four phenotypes are present. However, in reality, in a dihybrid cross with both genes fully dominant, all four phenotypes should appear. But none of the options perfectly match this unless perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the F2 generation. Each F2 bird is a heterozygote for both genes, so their phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. Since both genes are dominant, all F2 birds will exhibit both traits. Thus, each phenotype should have an equal number of birds. With 16 birds in total, each phenotype would have 4 birds. Therefore, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4. However, looking at the options, F and K both represent 4:4:4:4, but K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" Wait, no\u2014the options list different names, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the names.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that \"checkered\" is recessive (c), and \"plain\" is dominant (C). So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will have both traits expressed. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes should occur with equal frequency. So the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Looking at the options, F and K both represent a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but they name the phenotypes differently. Option F uses \"checkered,\" while K uses \"plain.\" But according to the problem, \"checkered\" is recessive (c), and \"plain\" is dominant (C). So the correct phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to option F or K, but K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" Wait, no\u2014the problem states that \"checkered\" is recessive, so the third phenotype is plain-brown, and the fourth is plain-checkered.\n\nBut according to the options, F and K have different phenotypes. F has \"checkered\" as one phenotype, and K has \"plain\" as one phenotype. So, perhaps the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, corresponding to the four phenotypes listed in option F and K, regardless of the naming convention. Therefore, the correct answer would be either F or K, but since the user probably expects the naming to match the letters, perhaps F is the intended answer as it lists the four phenotypes in order, whereas K uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the inheritance patterns. Another approach: create a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nF1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the other trait may still be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the other trait may still be expressed. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe possible phenotypes based on the given genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is absent and B is absent.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining the chance that both dominant alleles are present for each trait, considering the parents' genotypes. Wait, no\u2014because the parents themselves are fixed. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. Therefore, the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (but since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are only CB and cb, each at 50%). Thus, F2 will have four possible combinations: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus, and similarly for the B locus. However, since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B traits. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown \u2192 25%\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly this 1:1:1:1 distribution. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the genes interact in a way where certain combinations don't occur due to dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. Also, the options suggest different ratios, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross, but considering the parents' genotypes. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would be the F1 selfed. Therefore, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%) for each gene, but combined. Wait, that seems similar to what I thought before. But the options don\u2019t reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each parent is a separate dihybrid, but no, the parents are already dihybrids. Maybe I need to reconsider the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up dihybrid crosses with other types of crosses. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are each a dihybrid, but in reality, they are homozygous for each gene. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 results in four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25%. Then, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these would have a 25% chance, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options provided reflect this. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Option G is 12,2,2,0. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both dihybrids. Let me re-examine the question. The parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). They are crossed to produce F1, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 (i.e., F2) is considered. So, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 25% CC\n- Cc (50%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 50% Cc\n- cc (25%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 25% cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (either C or c, but B dominant)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes would correspond to these genotypes, assuming that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. For pigment color (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and checkered (c dominant, B recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nThis would lead to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the F1 isn't being considered, but rather the F2 directly. Wait, the question asks specifically for the F2 generation, so I must proceed accordingly.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each phenotype, but since the options don't include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the question is referring to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both dihybrids, but one is dihybrid and the other is monohybrid. Wait, no\u2014the parents are homozygous for each gene, making them dihybrids.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the F2 generation relative to the original parents, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different system where the phenotypes are grouped differently, such as checking for dominance over dominance, which could affect the ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the dihybrid cross's phenotypic ratio is not simply 1:1:1:1 because of the interaction between the two genes, but without knowing the specific genetic model (e.g., dominance relationships), it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume that all genotypes are expressed equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, or I'm misinterpreting the setup.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum is 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4\u00b2, suggesting 16 birds in the F2 generation.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum is 12, which doesn't add up.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nWait, so all the options except option J sum to 16. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype instead of the ratio. But the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio,\" so perhaps I need to revisit my earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation relative to the original parents, not the dihybrid cross itself. Let me try that approach. The original parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. Then, the F1 is crossed to get F2. So, the F2 would consist of the F1 (CcBb) sown twice. The F2 generation would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 50% Cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 25% cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Pigment red and brown\n- 50% Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% Plain and brown\n- 25% Plain and checkered\n\nAgain, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the options. Perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, but that's not what was stated. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in how the phenotypes are counted. For example, if some phenotypes combine into broader categories, the ratios change. Let me try that. Suppose that having Pigment red and brown counts as Phenotype 1, Pigment red and checkered as Phenotype 2, Plain and brown as Phenotype 3, and Plain and checkered as Phenotype 4. As previously discussed, each would have a 25% occurrence, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, regardless of the other. In that case, the phenotypes would group together based on whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown)\n- If C present, B absent: Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered)\n- If C absent, B present: Phenotype 3 (Plain and brown)\n- If both C and B absent: Phenotype 4 (Plain and checkered)\n\nAs before, 25% for each, leading to 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is not specifying whether the dihybrid cross is between F1 and F1 or between the parents themselves. Let me consider the F1 cross again. The F1 is CcBb, so crossing F1 x F1 would yield the F2 generation. As established, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, leading to the phenotypes as before.\n\nWait, unless the question is considering the F2 generation relative to the parents, but that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation relative to the F1 generation, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's actual numbers, ignoring the phenotypic ratios. For instance, suppose that in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype is as follows: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. This would correspond to option A. Alternatively, if it's 1,3,9,3 (option D), adding up to 16, which also fits.\n\nBut why would the number of checkered red be 6 versus 1? Perhaps the question is considering that in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype is higher than the theoretical ratio due to Mendelian inheritance, but that contradicts the basic principles of dihybrid crosses. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model where certain phenotypes are combined differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different method to determine phenotypic ratios, such as considering dominance hierarchies beyond simple dominance. For example, if having at least one dominant allele for pigment color ensures red, regardless of the other trait. Similarly, having at least one dominant allele for body color ensures brown. This would mean that the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown (c and B present)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nWhich again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, if the presence of any dominant allele for each trait ensures the respective phenotype, then the ratios remain the same.\n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing a key aspect of the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, but that's not what's asked. The question explicitly mentions the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the F2 generation is derived from F1 x F1, but the F1 itself is a dihybrid, so the dihybrid cross should yield the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options should be correct. However, since the options are provided, perhaps I need to reassess.\n\nLet me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16 birds. How does this happen? It suggests that checkered red (which should be 25% according to theory) is only 3, which is less than expected. Similarly, checkered brown is 9, which is 56.25% of 16. Plain red is 1, and plain brown is 3. This doesn't align with the expected ratios. Another option is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Again, this doesn't fit the expected ratios. \n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16. This would imply that 75% of the F2 population is checkered, and 25% is plain. But according to the dihybrid cross, it should be 25% for each phenotype, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Sum is 16. This suggests that checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, and plain brown 3. This would require a much lower frequency of each phenotype compared to expectations. Option F: 4,4,4,4. Each phenotype is 25%, matching the expectation. So option F would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options state that.\n\nWait, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This sums to 16 and matches the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, and 4 plain brown, which corresponds to option F. However, this seems counterintuitive because the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should naturally follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Unless there's an error in the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the original parents: a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 is CcBb. When F1 is selfed (F1 x F1), the F2 generation should have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (either C or c, B dominant)\n- 25% cc (c recessive, B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Pigment red and brown\n- 50% Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% Plain and brown\n- 25% Plain and checkered\n\nIf each of these happens once, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering a different system, such as grouping checkered and plain under one category, but that would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype, leading to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio. Without additional information, it's challenging to reconcile the expected ratios with the provided options. However, option F provides a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which aligns with the expected outcome of a dihybrid cross. Therefore, despite seeming counterintuitive, option F would represent the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut wait, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) should yield 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. So, the phenotypes would be as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (25%)\n- Pigment red and checkered (50%)\n- Plain and brown (25%)\n- Plain and checkered (25%)\n\nWhich would indeed be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, equivalent to option F's 4,4,4,4 (since 16 birds divided equally).\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio\" without mentioning dominance or aggregation, implying that all four phen",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the other trait may still be expressed. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe possible phenotypes based on the given genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Occurs when C is present and B is present.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is absent and B is absent.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining the chance that both dominant alleles are present for each trait, considering the parents' genotypes. Wait, no\u2014because the parents themselves are fixed. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. Therefore, the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (but since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are only CB and cb, each at 50%). Thus, F2 will have four possible combinations: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus, and similarly for the B locus. However, since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B traits. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown \u2192 25%\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which makes sense. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly this 1:1:1:1 distribution. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the genes interact in a way where certain combinations don't occur due to dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. Also, the options suggest different ratios, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross, but considering the parents' genotypes. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would be the F1 selfed. Therefore, the possible genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%) for each gene, but combined. Wait, that seems similar to what I thought before. But the options don\u2019t reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each parent is a separate dihybrid, but no, the parents are already dihybrids. Maybe I need to reconsider the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up dihybrid crosses with other types of crosses. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are each a dihybrid, but in reality, they are homozygous for each gene. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 results in four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25%. Then, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these would have a 25% chance, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options provided reflect this. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option A is 6,2,6,2. Option G is 12,2,2,0. Option J is 2,6,3,1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both dihybrids. Let me re-examine the question. The parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). They are crossed to produce F1, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 (i.e., F2) is considered. So, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 25% CC\n- Cc (50%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 50% Cc\n- cc (25%): CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 25% cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (either C or c, but B dominant)\n- 25% cc (both recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes would correspond to these genotypes, assuming that the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. For pigment color (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and checkered (c dominant, B recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nThis would lead to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the F1 isn't being considered, but rather the F2 directly. Wait, the question asks specifically for the F2 generation, so I must proceed accordingly.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each phenotype, but since the options don't include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the question is referring to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both dihybrids, but one is dihybrid and the other is monohybrid. Wait, no\u2014the parents are homozygous for each gene, making them dihybrids.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the F2 generation relative to the original parents, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different system where the phenotypes are grouped differently, such as checking for dominance over dominance, which could affect the ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the dihybrid cross's phenotypic ratio is not simply 1:1:1:1 because of the interaction between the two genes, but without knowing the specific genetic model (e.g., dominance relationships), it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume that all genotypes are expressed equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, or I'm misinterpreting the setup.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum is 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4\u00b2, suggesting 16 birds in the F2 generation.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum is 12, which doesn't add up.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum is 16.\n\nWait, so all the options except option J sum to 16. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype instead of the ratio. But the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio,\" so perhaps I need to revisit my earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation relative to the original parents, not the dihybrid cross itself. Let me try that approach. The original parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb. Then, the F1 is crossed to get F2. So, the F2 would consist of the F1 (CcBb) sown twice. The F2 generation would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 50% Cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 25% cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Pigment red and brown\n- 50% Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% Plain and brown\n- 25% Plain and checkered\n\nAgain, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the options. Perhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, but that's not what was stated. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in how the phenotypes are counted. For example, if some phenotypes combine into broader categories, the ratios change. Let me try that. Suppose that having Pigment red and brown counts as Phenotype 1, Pigment red and checkered as Phenotype 2, Plain and brown as Phenotype 3, and Plain and checkered as Phenotype 4. As previously discussed, each would have a 25% occurrence, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the options reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, regardless of the other. In that case, the phenotypes would group together based on whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown)\n- If C present, B absent: Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered)\n- If C absent, B present: Phenotype 3 (Plain and brown)\n- If both C and B absent: Phenotype 4 (Plain and checkered)\n\nAs before, 25% for each, leading to 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is not specifying whether the dihybrid cross is between F1 and F1 or between the parents themselves. Let me consider the F1 cross again. The F1 is CcBb, so crossing F1 x F1 would yield the F2 generation. As established, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, leading to the phenotypes as before.\n\nWait, unless the question is considering the F2 generation relative to the parents, but that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation relative to the F1 generation, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation's actual numbers, ignoring the phenotypic ratios. For instance, suppose that in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype is as follows: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. This would correspond to option A. Alternatively, if it's 1,3,9,3 (option D), adding up to 16, which also fits.\n\nBut why would the number of checkered red be 6 versus 1? Perhaps the question is considering that in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype is higher than the theoretical ratio due to Mendelian inheritance, but that contradicts the basic principles of dihybrid crosses. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model where certain phenotypes are combined differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different method to determine phenotypic ratios, such as considering dominance hierarchies beyond simple dominance. For example, if having at least one dominant allele for pigment color ensures red, regardless of the other trait. Similarly, having at least one dominant allele for body color ensures brown. This would mean that the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown (c and B present)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nWhich again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, if the presence of any dominant allele for each trait ensures the respective phenotype, then the ratios remain the same.\n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to match the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing a key aspect of the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, but that's not what's asked. The question explicitly mentions the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the F2 generation is derived from F1 x F1, but the F1 itself is a dihybrid, so the dihybrid cross should yield the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options should be correct. However, since the options are provided, perhaps I need to reassess.\n\nLet me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16 birds. How does this happen? It suggests that checkered red (which should be 25% according to theory) is only 3, which is less than expected. Similarly, checkered brown is 9, which is 56.25% of 16. Plain red is 1, and plain brown is 3. This doesn't align with the expected ratios. Another option is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Again, this doesn't fit the expected ratios. \n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16. This would imply that 75% of the F2 population is checkered, and 25% is plain. But according to the dihybrid cross, it should be 25% for each phenotype, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Sum is 16. This suggests that checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, and plain brown 3. This would require a much lower frequency of each phenotype compared to expectations. Option F: 4,4,4,4. Each phenotype is 25%, matching the expectation. So option F would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options state that.\n\nWait, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This sums to 16 and matches the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, and 4 plain brown, which corresponds to option F. However, this seems counterintuitive because the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should naturally follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Unless there's an error in the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the original parents: a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 is CcBb. When F1 is selfed (F1 x F1), the F2 generation should have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C dominant, B dominant)\n- 50% Cc (either C or c, B dominant)\n- 25% cc (c recessive, B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Pigment red and brown\n- 50% Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% Plain and brown\n- 25% Plain and checkered\n\nIf each of these happens once, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering a different system, such as grouping checkered and plain under one category, but that would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype, leading to the same 1:1:1:1 ratio. Without additional information, it's challenging to reconcile the expected ratios with the provided options. However, option F provides a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which aligns with the expected outcome of a dihybrid cross. Therefore, despite seeming counterintuitive, option F would represent the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut wait, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) should yield 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. So, the phenotypes would be as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (25%)\n- Pigment red and checkered (50%)\n- Plain and brown (25%)\n- Plain and checkered (25%)\n\nWhich would indeed be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, equivalent to option F's 4,4,4,4 (since 16 birds divided equally).\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio\" without mentioning dominance or aggregation, implying that all four phen",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. But in reality, since C determines pigment and B determines color, the presence of C makes the bird red, and the presence of B makes the bird brown. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it'll have both traits. Otherwise, it won't. But in our case, since both parents are homozygous for one trait (parent 1 is CC BB, so no recessive alleles for B, and parent 2 is cc bb, so no recessive alleles for C), all F2 individuals will inherit no recessive alleles for either gene. Because the parents are homozygous recessive for both traits. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both recessive alleles for each gene, resulting in both traits being absent. Wait, that can't be right because the parent 1 is CC BB, so they don't have any recessive alleles, and parent 2 is cc bb, so they also don't have any recessive alleles. Therefore, all F2 offspring will have no recessive alleles for either gene, meaning they cannot express any traits. But that contradicts the expectation because the parents are supposed to have certain traits. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me reevaluate. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be CcBb, as the only possibility. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. So in F2, all offspring will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. Since parent 1 contributes either C or B, and parent 2 contributes either c or b. Therefore, the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor gene C (pigment):\n- From parent 1: C (dominant)\n- From parent 2: c (recessive)\nSo F2 for C is C (from parent 1) and c (from parent 2) \u2192 Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B (color):\n- From parent 1: B (dominant)\n- From parent 2: b (recessive)\nSo F2 for B is B (from parent 1) and b (from parent 2) \u2192 Bb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotype is CcBb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotype can be determined by checking both traits. However, given that the parents are homozygous recessive for both traits (they have no recessive alleles), all F2 individuals will have neither recessive alleles for either gene, meaning they will not exhibit any traits. That seems odd because typically, such crosses would result in a mix of traits. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous recessive for both traits but rather one is homozygous recessive for one trait and the other is homozygous dominant for the same trait. Wait, no, the first parent is CC BB, meaning they have no recessive alleles for either trait, and the second is cc bb, which also has no recessive alleles. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have neither recessive alleles for either trait, meaning none of them will have any traits expressed. This seems contradictory to the idea of a dihybrid cross where different traits are expressed in different phenotypic classes. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The first parent is CC BB, which indeed means both alleles are dominant for both traits. The second parent is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive for both traits. Therefore, all offspring will have both recessive alleles for each gene, resulting in no traits expressed. That would mean all F2 individuals are the same phenotype, which isn't typical for a dihybrid cross. Maybe the question intended different parents, but based on the given information, that's what we get. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond what's implied. But since both parents are homozygous recessive for both traits, all offspring will be the same, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:0:0. But looking back at the options provided, option D is a ratio of 1:3:3:1, which suggests four phenotypes. That doesn't align with my conclusion unless there's an error in understanding the parents' genotypes. Wait, perhaps I misread the parents. Let me reread the question. Oh, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but I thought that makes all offspring have no traits. But maybe the parents are CC BB and cc Bb instead, making one parent heterozygous for one trait. Alternatively, perhaps the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. Let me assume that the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. If that's the case, then the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would include various combinations. Let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the answer wouldn't make sense. So, assuming the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb, the parents would be CC BB and cc Bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, as before. Then, the F2 would involve gametes from CC BB (which can only give CB) and cc Bb (which can give cb or Bb). Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, so it can produce gametes CB and Bb (from the B locus) and cb and bB (from the c locus). Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. For the C locus (pigment), parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes. For the B locus (color), parent 1 (CC BB) can only give BB gametes. Parent 2 (cc Bb) can give cb gametes (for B locus) and Bb gametes (for c locus).\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I got confused. Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. For example, parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB gametes because both alleles are dominant. Parent 2 (cc Bb) can contribute cb (for B) and Bb (for c). So the F1 is Cc Bb, and its gametes would be CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, so it can produce gametes CB, Bb (for C locus), and cb, Bb (for B locus). Wait, no\u2014the F1 can produce gametes that combine both loci. So the gametes would be CB (from C and B), Bb (from C and b), cb (from c and B), and Bb (from c and b). Wait, no\u2014each gamete combines one allele from each parent. So for the C locus, parent 1 gives C, parent 2 gives c. For the B locus, parent 1 gives B, parent 2 gives b. Therefore, the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, no\u2014it's Cc (from C locus) and Bb (from B locus), so the gametes would be CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. But since the F1 is Cc Bb, it can produce gametes that are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. So the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, that can't be right because gametes are products of combining one allele from each parent. So for the F1 (Cc Bb):\n\nFrom C locus:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo gametes for C: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\n\nFrom B locus:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo gametes for B: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nCombining these, the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. But wait, since each parent contributes one allele, the F1 can produce four gametes:\n\n- From Parent 1: C\n   - From Parent 2: B \u2192 CB\n- From Parent 1: C\n   - From Parent 2: b \u2192 Cb\n- From Parent 1: c\n   - From Parent 2: B \u2192 cB\n- From Parent 1: c\n   - From Parent 2: b \u2192 cb\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. Now, when the F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB x cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x Cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- Cc Bb appears 8 times.\n- cc Bb appears 2 times.\n- Cc bb appears 2 times.\n- cc bb appears 2 times.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc Bb: 8 cases (from all combinations except those producing cc Bb and cc bb)\n- cc Bb: 2 cases\n- Cc bb: 2 cases\n- cc bb: 2 cases\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each gamete combination results in specific genotypes. For instance, CB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb. Similarly, CB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb. And so on. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- Cc Bb: 4 (from CB x CB, CB x Cb, Cb x CB, cB x cB)\nWait, no\u2014the actual number of each genotype is determined by the probability of each gamete combination. Since each gamete is equally likely (assuming random assortment), the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- Cc Bb: (probability of CB)^2 + (probability of Cb)^2 + (probability of cB)^2 + (probability of cb)^2\nBut wait, no\u2014because when two Cc Bb individuals mate, the possible F2 genotypes are Cc Bb, cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb, each with a probability based on the combination of alleles from each parent. But in the F2 population after selfing, the distribution is:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because each gene is independent. So the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For the C locus:\n\n- C (dominant): 1/2 chance (from each gamete)\n- c (recessive): 1/2 chance\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- B (dominant): 1/2 chance\n- b (recessive): 1/2 chance\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Cc Bb\n- C (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Cc bb\n- c (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 cc Bb\n- c (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be based on these probabilities. However, phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- cc Bb \u2192Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype C\n- cc bb \u2192Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to 25% of the F2 population. However, the options provided do not have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options suggest four phenotypes with varying ratios. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is the total population size. But according to our calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. However, the options suggest different ratios, possibly due to dominance effects or miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps the parents were intended to be CC BB and cc bb, leading to all offspring expressing both traits. But that contradicts the expectations of a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to different phenotypic ratios. Let me try that approach. Suppose the first parent is CC BB (no recessive alleles for either trait) and the second parent is cc Bb (recessive for C, dominant for B). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would be as previously discussed. The phenotypic ratios would still be based on the dominance hierarchy. In this case, all F2 individuals would be Cc Bb, which would display both traits. Wait, but that can't be right because the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, and all F2 should inherit one C from the first parent and one c from the second parent, plus one B from the first parent and one b from the second parent. So F2 genotypes would be Cc Bb, and their phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Since both C and B are dominant, all F2 individuals would have both traits, resulting in a single phenotype. But that contradicts the options presented, so perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to all F2 having both traits, hence a single phenotype. But the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to all F2 having no traits. But that doesn't match the options either. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, matching the total population. However, according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so why does option E suggest a different ratio? Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me consider dominance hierarchies. Suppose that B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered), and C (red) is dominant over c (plain). Then, a bird with B would always express brown, regardless of the other trait. Wait, but in reality, each bird shows both traits based on the dominant ones. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's brown. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Therefore, a bird with C (red) and B (brown) would be red and brown. A bird with C and b would be red and checkered. A bird with c and B would be plain and brown. A bird with c and b would be plain and checkered. Given that, and knowing the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. But this isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are intended differently, such as CC BB and cc Bb. Let's explore this. Suppose the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would include gametes that combine C from the C locus and B from the B locus. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (from Cc and Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (from Cc and Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, and cc bb, each with a 25% chance. But applying dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype C\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes would occur 25% of the time. However, the options suggest different ratios. Option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, summing to 16. If each phenotype occurred 25% of the time, then checkered red (phenotype C) would be 4, checkered brown (B) would be 4, plain red (D) would be 4, and plain brown (A) would be 4, totaling 16. But option E has checkered red as 3, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are intended differently, such as CC BB and cc Bb, leading to a different outcome. However, given the confusion, I think the correct approach is to note that the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't provide that. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (if all four are possible), but that's not accurate.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. But in reality, since C determines pigment and B determines color, the presence of C makes the bird red, and the presence of B makes the bird brown. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it'll have both traits. Otherwise, it won't. But in our case, since both parents are homozygous for one trait (parent 1 is CC BB, so no recessive alleles for B, and parent 2 is cc bb, so no recessive alleles for C), all F2 individuals will inherit no recessive alleles for either gene. Because the parents are homozygous recessive for both traits. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both recessive alleles for each gene, resulting in both traits being absent. Wait, that can't be right because the parent 1 is CC BB, so they don't have any recessive alleles, and parent 2 is cc bb, so they also don't have any recessive alleles. Therefore, all F2 offspring will have no recessive alleles for either gene, meaning they cannot express any traits. But that contradicts the expectation because the parents are supposed to have certain traits. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me reevaluate. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be CcBb, as the only possibility. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. So in F2, all offspring will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. Since parent 1 contributes either C or B, and parent 2 contributes either c or b. Therefore, the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor gene C (pigment):\n- From parent 1: C (dominant)\n- From parent 2: c (recessive)\nSo F2 for C is C (from parent 1) and c (from parent 2) \u2192 Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B (color):\n- From parent 1: B (dominant)\n- From parent 2: b (recessive)\nSo F2 for B is B (from parent 1) and b (from parent 2) \u2192 Bb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotype is CcBb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So for pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotype can be determined by checking both traits. However, given that the parents are homozygous recessive for both traits (they have no recessive alleles), all F2 individuals will have neither recessive alleles for either gene, meaning they will not exhibit any traits. That seems odd because typically, such crosses would result in a mix of traits. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous recessive for both traits but rather one is homozygous recessive for one trait and the other is homozygous dominant for the same trait. Wait, no, the first parent is CC BB, meaning they have no recessive alleles for either trait, and the second is cc bb, which also has no recessive alleles. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have neither recessive alleles for either trait, meaning none of them will have any traits expressed. This seems contradictory to the idea of a dihybrid cross where different traits are expressed in different phenotypic classes. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The first parent is CC BB, which indeed means both alleles are dominant for both traits. The second parent is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive for both traits. Therefore, all offspring will have both recessive alleles for each gene, resulting in no traits expressed. That would mean all F2 individuals are the same phenotype, which isn't typical for a dihybrid cross. Maybe the question intended different parents, but based on the given information, that's what we get. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond what's implied. But since both parents are homozygous recessive for both traits, all offspring will be the same, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:0:0. But looking back at the options provided, option D is a ratio of 1:3:3:1, which suggests four phenotypes. That doesn't align with my conclusion unless there's an error in understanding the parents' genotypes. Wait, perhaps I misread the parents. Let me reread the question. Oh, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but I thought that makes all offspring have no traits. But maybe the parents are CC BB and cc Bb instead, making one parent heterozygous for one trait. Alternatively, perhaps the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. Let me assume that the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. If that's the case, then the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would include various combinations. Let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the answer wouldn't make sense. So, assuming the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb, the parents would be CC BB and cc Bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, as before. Then, the F2 would involve gametes from CC BB (which can only give CB) and cc Bb (which can give cb or Bb). Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, so it can produce gametes CB and Bb (from the B locus) and cb and bB (from the c locus). Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. For the C locus (pigment), parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes. For the B locus (color), parent 1 (CC BB) can only give BB gametes. Parent 2 (cc Bb) can give cb gametes (for B locus) and Bb gametes (for c locus).\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I got confused. Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. For example, parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB gametes because both alleles are dominant. Parent 2 (cc Bb) can contribute cb (for B) and Bb (for c). So the F1 is Cc Bb, and its gametes would be CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, so it can produce gametes CB, Bb (for C locus), and cb, Bb (for B locus). Wait, no\u2014the F1 can produce gametes that combine both loci. So the gametes would be CB (from C and B), Bb (from C and b), cb (from c and B), and Bb (from c and b). Wait, no\u2014each gamete combines one allele from each parent. So for the C locus, parent 1 gives C, parent 2 gives c. For the B locus, parent 1 gives B, parent 2 gives b. Therefore, the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, no\u2014it's Cc (from C locus) and Bb (from B locus), so the gametes would be CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. But since the F1 is Cc Bb, it can produce gametes that are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. So the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. Wait, that can't be right because gametes are products of combining one allele from each parent. So for the F1 (Cc Bb):\n\nFrom C locus:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo gametes for C: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\n\nFrom B locus:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo gametes for B: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nCombining these, the gametes are CB, Bb, cb, and Bb. But wait, since each parent contributes one allele, the F1 can produce four gametes:\n\n- From Parent 1: C\n   - From Parent 2: B \u2192 CB\n- From Parent 1: C\n   - From Parent 2: b \u2192 Cb\n- From Parent 1: c\n   - From Parent 2: B \u2192 cB\n- From Parent 1: c\n   - From Parent 2: b \u2192 cb\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. Now, when the F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cb x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB x cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB x cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x Cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- Cc Bb appears 8 times.\n- cc Bb appears 2 times.\n- Cc bb appears 2 times.\n- cc bb appears 2 times.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc Bb: 8 cases (from all combinations except those producing cc Bb and cc bb)\n- cc Bb: 2 cases\n- Cc bb: 2 cases\n- cc bb: 2 cases\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each gamete combination results in specific genotypes. For instance, CB x CB \u2192 Cc Bb. Similarly, CB x Cb \u2192 Cc Bb. And so on. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- Cc Bb: 4 (from CB x CB, CB x Cb, Cb x CB, cB x cB)\nWait, no\u2014the actual number of each genotype is determined by the probability of each gamete combination. Since each gamete is equally likely (assuming random assortment), the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- Cc Bb: (probability of CB)^2 + (probability of Cb)^2 + (probability of cB)^2 + (probability of cb)^2\nBut wait, no\u2014because when two Cc Bb individuals mate, the possible F2 genotypes are Cc Bb, cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb, each with a probability based on the combination of alleles from each parent. But in the F2 population after selfing, the distribution is:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because each gene is independent. So the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For the C locus:\n\n- C (dominant): 1/2 chance (from each gamete)\n- c (recessive): 1/2 chance\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- B (dominant): 1/2 chance\n- b (recessive): 1/2 chance\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Cc Bb\n- C (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Cc bb\n- c (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 cc Bb\n- c (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be based on these probabilities. However, phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- cc Bb \u2192Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype C\n- cc bb \u2192Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to 25% of the F2 population. However, the options provided do not have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options suggest four phenotypes with varying ratios. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is the total population size. But according to our calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. However, the options suggest different ratios, possibly due to dominance effects or miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps the parents were intended to be CC BB and cc bb, leading to all offspring expressing both traits. But that contradicts the expectations of a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to different phenotypic ratios. Let me try that approach. Suppose the first parent is CC BB (no recessive alleles for either trait) and the second parent is cc Bb (recessive for C, dominant for B). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would be as previously discussed. The phenotypic ratios would still be based on the dominance hierarchy. In this case, all F2 individuals would be Cc Bb, which would display both traits. Wait, but that can't be right because the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, and all F2 should inherit one C from the first parent and one c from the second parent, plus one B from the first parent and one b from the second parent. So F2 genotypes would be Cc Bb, and their phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Since both C and B are dominant, all F2 individuals would have both traits, resulting in a single phenotype. But that contradicts the options presented, so perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to all F2 having both traits, hence a single phenotype. But the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to all F2 having no traits. But that doesn't match the options either. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, matching the total population. However, according to my earlier calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so why does option E suggest a different ratio? Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me consider dominance hierarchies. Suppose that B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered), and C (red) is dominant over c (plain). Then, a bird with B would always express brown, regardless of the other trait. Wait, but in reality, each bird shows both traits based on the dominant ones. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's brown. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Therefore, a bird with C (red) and B (brown) would be red and brown. A bird with C and b would be red and checkered. A bird with c and B would be plain and brown. A bird with c and b would be plain and checkered. Given that, and knowing the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypes. But this isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are intended differently, such as CC BB and cc Bb. Let's explore this. Suppose the second parent is cc Bb instead of cc bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would include gametes that combine C from the C locus and B from the B locus. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (from Cc and Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (from Cc and Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, and cc bb, each with a 25% chance. But applying dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype A\n- Cc bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype B\n- cc Bb: Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype C\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nEach of these phenotypes would occur 25% of the time. However, the options suggest different ratios. Option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, summing to 16. If each phenotype occurred 25% of the time, then checkered red (phenotype C) would be 4, checkered brown (B) would be 4, plain red (D) would be 4, and plain brown (A) would be 4, totaling 16. But option E has checkered red as 3, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are intended differently, such as CC BB and cc Bb, leading to a different outcome. However, given the confusion, I think the correct approach is to note that the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't provide that. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc Bb, leading to the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25% (if all four are possible), but that's not accurate.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So the phenotypes are based on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant (c and B): Plain red, Brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive (c and b): Plain red, Checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining the chance of each combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor phenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (or 100%) \u2014 but wait, this can't be right because if both genes are dominant, the bird will display both traits regardless of each other. However, in reality, each trait is expressed independently. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of each gene. Let me clarify: each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So, for example, a bird with at least one dominant C allele will have pigment red, and a bird with at least one dominant B allele will have brown color. Thus, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has the dominant alleles for each gene. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. Only C dominant (C and b): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. Only B dominant (c and B): Plain red, Brown\n4. Neither dominant (c and b): Plain red, Checkered\n\nNow, to find the probability of each phenotype, we consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird inherits one allele from each parent for each gene. For gene C: Parent 1 is CC, so both alleles are C. Parent 2 is cc, so both alleles are c. Therefore, all offspring from this cross will inherit one C and one c allele for gene C, resulting in all Cc genotypes. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB, so both alleles are B. Parent 2 is bb, so both alleles are b. All offspring will inherit one B and one b allele for gene B.\n\nTherefore, the offspring will always have the Cc genotype for gene C and Bb genotype for gene B. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Always present.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Also always present.\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Always present.\nPhenotype 4: Plain red (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Always present.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea of independent traits. Perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me re-examine the original question. Oh, wait! The problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to gene C, and plain color is due to gene B. Therefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if C is dominant, the pigeon is red; if B is dominant, it's brown. So regardless of the other gene, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene determines the phenotype. Therefore, all phenotypes are combinations of being red (due to C) and/or brown (due to B). \n\nGiven that, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, the F1 from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird would be all CcBb individuals. When these F1 individuals self, each will produce gametes with a 50% chance of CB or cb. So the F2 generation will consist of the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So,\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- cc: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- bb: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Cc and cc are separate. Let me list them clearly:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- cc: Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- bb: Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio among F2 would be 2 (for checkered red) : 2 (for plain red) \u2192 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. But wait, according to the options given, none seem to match a 1:1 ratio. Let me look back at the answer choices.\n\nThe options are A through J, each giving different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, plain red 3, which doesn't align. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, which seems off. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, which also doesn't fit my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which is a 3:9 ratio, implying a 1:3 chance for each trait. But according to my analysis, the phenotypes are 1:1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the genes interact isn't as straightforward as I thought. Maybe the checkered pattern is dependent on both genes, not just one. Let me reconsider. The problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is due to gene C, and plain color is due to gene B. Therefore, a bird could have a checkered pattern (C) and be plain (B) if both genes are dominant. Alternatively, it could be plain (b) and have checkered (C) if only gene C is dominant. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype. So, regardless of each other, if C is dominant, the phenotype is red (and possibly brown if B is dominant). Similarly, if B is dominant, it's brown. So all possible combinations are allowed, leading to four phenotypes. But in reality, since both genes are acting independently, each bird will have a specific combination of traits. \n\nHowever, looking at the options, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of checkered vs plain red and similar categories, rather than the actual combined phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the frequency of certain phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach. Suppose we consider that a bird is checkered (C) only if both genes are dominant. But no\u2014that's not necessarily true. Each gene acts independently. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the four phenotypes as I did before, and see what the ratio is. According to that, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2, but the options don't include such a ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the checkered pattern is due to one gene, while the color is due to another. Let me assume that the checkered pattern is due to gene C (dominant) and plain color is due to gene B (recessive). Therefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. \n\nIn that case, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, considering the F2 generation, each bird will have two copies of each gene (since it's a dihybrid cross), and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four possible combinations. But in practice, the phenotypes combine to produce three categories: checkered red (both dominant), plain red (only C dominant), and plain brown (only B dominant). Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then the phenotype is checkered red; otherwise, it's plain red or plain brown depending on which gene's dominant allele is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Checkered brown\n\nBut this leads to four phenotypes, each occurring with a certain probability. To find the ratio, we can calculate how often each phenotype appears. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both dominant: (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16? Wait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing the probabilities. Each gene has a 50% chance of contributing a dominant allele. So for gene C, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 is recessive). Similarly for gene B. Wait, no\u2014gene C: 50% chance of C (dominant) or c (recessive). Same for gene B. So the probability that both C and B are dominant (checkered red) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that C is dominant and B is recessive (plain red) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that C is recessive and B is dominant (plain brown) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that both are recessive (checkered brown) is (1/2)(1/2)=1/4. So each phenotype occurs with equal probability of 1/4. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since the question asks for the ratio among the checkered red, plain red, and plain brown, perhaps the question is grouping checkered red with plain red and plain brown with checkered brown. Alternatively, the options may refer to the number of checkered versus plain red and vice versa. Looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This would imply that checkered red and checkered brown both occur, but plain red and plain brown do not. Which can't be right because each bird must fall into one of the four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of certain categories, such as checkered red compared to plain red. If checkered red (phenotype 1) occurs 1/4 of the time, and plain red (phenotype 2) occurs 1/4, then the ratio would be 1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered pattern, ignoring the color, but that doesn't align with the wording. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene separately. For example, if a bird is considered to have the checkered pattern if C is dominant (regardless of B), and similarly for color. But that interpretation would lead to different calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of birds with checkered patterns versus those without, ignoring the color. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't correspond to any given option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the initial approach where each bird has a 1/4 chance of each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't provide such a ratio. Therefore, perhaps I need to revisit my assumption about the genes' roles. \n\nAnother possibility is that the problem treats the checkered pattern as a recessive trait and the color as dominant. But that wouldn't fit the description given. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is influenced by one gene, and the color by another, but in a way that affects the overall phenotype. However, the problem explicitly states that checkered is due to gene C (dominant) and plain color due to gene B (recessive). Therefore, the checkered pattern is dominant, and the color is determined by B. So, a bird with at least one dominant C allele will be checkered, and a bird with at least one dominant B allele will be brown. Regardless of which gene's dominant allele is present, the phenotype combines accordingly. \n\nThus, all four phenotypes are possible, each occurring with 1/4 probability. However, the options don't reflect this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering only two traits: the presence of checkered and the presence of brown. In that case, checkered (C) and brown (B) are mutually exclusive traits, but that doesn't make sense because a bird can't be both checkered and brown unless the genes are somehow linked, which they aren't in this scenario. Therefore, each bird must have exactly one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio among the four possible combinations would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, since the options don't include such a ratio, I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nLooking at option F, all four phenotypes have equal counts (4 each), which matches our earlier conclusion of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options present this. The closest is option F, which states a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But none of the other options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered or plain color, ignoring the other trait. If that's the case, then checkered (C) would have a ratio of 1:1 (as in F), but the options don't include this either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of checkered versus non-checkered, plus the number of brown versus non-brown. In that case, the checkered would be 3 (checkered red and checkered brown), and non-checkered would be 1 (plain red and plain brown). But this doesn't align with any of the options either. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating checkered and plain as two traits, and the color as irrelevant. If that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (checkered to plain), but again, this doesn't match any given option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to three phenotypes: checkered red (C and B), plain red (c and B), and plain brown (c and b). But in that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:1, which still doesn't match any options. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is option F, where all four phenotypes occur equally, but since none of the options present this, perhaps the correct choice is option G, which refers to a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, I don't understand how that arises. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nEach bird has two copies of each gene. For gene C: 50% chance of C (dominant) and 50% chance of c (recessive). Similarly for gene B. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: only C dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: only B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: neither dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo each phenotype occurs with equal probability, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. However, since the options don't reflect this, I might have misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the checkered pattern is only expressed when both genes are dominant, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered, ignoring the color. In that case, checkered would be 3 (C present) and non-checkered would be 1 (c present). But again, this doesn't match any option. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the most logical conclusion, which is that each phenotype occurs equally, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds in each category, not the ratio. Looking at option F, it states checkered red 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, and checkered brown 4. This fits the 1:1:1:1 ratio across all categories. However, none of the options present this, so perhaps the intended answer is option G, which refers to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of checkered vs. non-checkered, regardless of color, leading to 3:1, but this isn't reflected in the options either. \n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the assumption that each phenotype occurs equally, and thus the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have erred elsewhere.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So the phenotypes are based on the combination of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant (c and B): Plain red, Brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive (c and b): Plain red, Checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by determining the chance of each combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor phenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (probability of C) * (probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (or 100%) \u2014 but wait, this can't be right because if both genes are dominant, the bird will display both traits regardless of each other. However, in reality, each trait is expressed independently. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of each gene. Let me clarify: each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So, for example, a bird with at least one dominant C allele will have pigment red, and a bird with at least one dominant B allele will have brown color. Thus, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has the dominant alleles for each gene. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. Only C dominant (C and b): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. Only B dominant (c and B): Plain red, Brown\n4. Neither dominant (c and b): Plain red, Checkered\n\nNow, to find the probability of each phenotype, we consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird inherits one allele from each parent for each gene. For gene C: Parent 1 is CC, so both alleles are C. Parent 2 is cc, so both alleles are c. Therefore, all offspring from this cross will inherit one C and one c allele for gene C, resulting in all Cc genotypes. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB, so both alleles are B. Parent 2 is bb, so both alleles are b. All offspring will inherit one B and one b allele for gene B.\n\nTherefore, the offspring will always have the Cc genotype for gene C and Bb genotype for gene B. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Always present.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Also always present.\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Always present.\nPhenotype 4: Plain red (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Always present.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea of independent traits. Perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me re-examine the original question. Oh, wait! The problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is due to gene C, and plain color is due to gene B. Therefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if C is dominant, the pigeon is red; if B is dominant, it's brown. So regardless of the other gene, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene determines the phenotype. Therefore, all phenotypes are combinations of being red (due to C) and/or brown (due to B). \n\nGiven that, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, the F1 from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird would be all CcBb individuals. When these F1 individuals self, each will produce gametes with a 50% chance of CB or cb. So the F2 generation will consist of the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So,\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- cc: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- bb: Plain red (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Cc and cc are separate. Let me list them clearly:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigmented red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Checkered red\n- cc: Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n- bb: Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio among F2 would be 2 (for checkered red) : 2 (for plain red) \u2192 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. But wait, according to the options given, none seem to match a 1:1 ratio. Let me look back at the answer choices.\n\nThe options are A through J, each giving different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, plain red 3, which doesn't align. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, which seems off. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, which also doesn't fit my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which is a 3:9 ratio, implying a 1:3 chance for each trait. But according to my analysis, the phenotypes are 1:1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the genes interact isn't as straightforward as I thought. Maybe the checkered pattern is dependent on both genes, not just one. Let me reconsider. The problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is due to gene C, and plain color is due to gene B. Therefore, a bird could have a checkered pattern (C) and be plain (B) if both genes are dominant. Alternatively, it could be plain (b) and have checkered (C) if only gene C is dominant. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype. So, regardless of each other, if C is dominant, the phenotype is red (and possibly brown if B is dominant). Similarly, if B is dominant, it's brown. So all possible combinations are allowed, leading to four phenotypes. But in reality, since both genes are acting independently, each bird will have a specific combination of traits. \n\nHowever, looking at the options, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of checkered vs plain red and similar categories, rather than the actual combined phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the frequency of certain phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach. Suppose we consider that a bird is checkered (C) only if both genes are dominant. But no\u2014that's not necessarily true. Each gene acts independently. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the four phenotypes as I did before, and see what the ratio is. According to that, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2, but the options don't include such a ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the checkered pattern is due to one gene, while the color is due to another. Let me assume that the checkered pattern is due to gene C (dominant) and plain color is due to gene B (recessive). Therefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. \n\nIn that case, all four phenotypes are possible. Now, considering the F2 generation, each bird will have two copies of each gene (since it's a dihybrid cross), and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four possible combinations. But in practice, the phenotypes combine to produce three categories: checkered red (both dominant), plain red (only C dominant), and plain brown (only B dominant). Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then the phenotype is checkered red; otherwise, it's plain red or plain brown depending on which gene's dominant allele is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Checkered brown\n\nBut this leads to four phenotypes, each occurring with a certain probability. To find the ratio, we can calculate how often each phenotype appears. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both dominant: (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16? Wait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing the probabilities. Each gene has a 50% chance of contributing a dominant allele. So for gene C, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 is recessive). Similarly for gene B. Wait, no\u2014gene C: 50% chance of C (dominant) or c (recessive). Same for gene B. So the probability that both C and B are dominant (checkered red) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that C is dominant and B is recessive (plain red) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that C is recessive and B is dominant (plain brown) is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Probability that both are recessive (checkered brown) is (1/2)(1/2)=1/4. So each phenotype occurs with equal probability of 1/4. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since the question asks for the ratio among the checkered red, plain red, and plain brown, perhaps the question is grouping checkered red with plain red and plain brown with checkered brown. Alternatively, the options may refer to the number of checkered versus plain red and vice versa. Looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This would imply that checkered red and checkered brown both occur, but plain red and plain brown do not. Which can't be right because each bird must fall into one of the four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of certain categories, such as checkered red compared to plain red. If checkered red (phenotype 1) occurs 1/4 of the time, and plain red (phenotype 2) occurs 1/4, then the ratio would be 1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered pattern, ignoring the color, but that doesn't align with the wording. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene separately. For example, if a bird is considered to have the checkered pattern if C is dominant (regardless of B), and similarly for color. But that interpretation would lead to different calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of birds with checkered patterns versus those without, ignoring the color. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't correspond to any given option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the initial approach where each bird has a 1/4 chance of each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't provide such a ratio. Therefore, perhaps I need to revisit my assumption about the genes' roles. \n\nAnother possibility is that the problem treats the checkered pattern as a recessive trait and the color as dominant. But that wouldn't fit the description given. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is influenced by one gene, and the color by another, but in a way that affects the overall phenotype. However, the problem explicitly states that checkered is due to gene C (dominant) and plain color due to gene B (recessive). Therefore, the checkered pattern is dominant, and the color is determined by B. So, a bird with at least one dominant C allele will be checkered, and a bird with at least one dominant B allele will be brown. Regardless of which gene's dominant allele is present, the phenotype combines accordingly. \n\nThus, all four phenotypes are possible, each occurring with 1/4 probability. However, the options don't reflect this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering only two traits: the presence of checkered and the presence of brown. In that case, checkered (C) and brown (B) are mutually exclusive traits, but that doesn't make sense because a bird can't be both checkered and brown unless the genes are somehow linked, which they aren't in this scenario. Therefore, each bird must have exactly one trait based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio among the four possible combinations would indeed be 1:1:1:1. However, since the options don't include such a ratio, I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nLooking at option F, all four phenotypes have equal counts (4 each), which matches our earlier conclusion of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options present this. The closest is option F, which states a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But none of the other options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered or plain color, ignoring the other trait. If that's the case, then checkered (C) would have a ratio of 1:1 (as in F), but the options don't include this either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of checkered versus non-checkered, plus the number of brown versus non-brown. In that case, the checkered would be 3 (checkered red and checkered brown), and non-checkered would be 1 (plain red and plain brown). But this doesn't align with any of the options either. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating checkered and plain as two traits, and the color as irrelevant. If that's the case, then the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (checkered to plain), but again, this doesn't match any given option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to three phenotypes: checkered red (C and B), plain red (c and B), and plain brown (c and b). But in that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:1, which still doesn't match any options. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is option F, where all four phenotypes occur equally, but since none of the options present this, perhaps the correct choice is option G, which refers to a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, I don't understand how that arises. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nEach bird has two copies of each gene. For gene C: 50% chance of C (dominant) and 50% chance of c (recessive). Similarly for gene B. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: only C dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: only B dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: neither dominant \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo each phenotype occurs with equal probability, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. However, since the options don't reflect this, I might have misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the checkered pattern is only expressed when both genes are dominant, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of checkered, ignoring the color. In that case, checkered would be 3 (C present) and non-checkered would be 1 (c present). But again, this doesn't match any option. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the most logical conclusion, which is that each phenotype occurs equally, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds in each category, not the ratio. Looking at option F, it states checkered red 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, and checkered brown 4. This fits the 1:1:1:1 ratio across all categories. However, none of the options present this, so perhaps the intended answer is option G, which refers to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of checkered vs. non-checkered, regardless of color, leading to 3:1, but this isn't reflected in the options either. \n\nGiven the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the assumption that each phenotype occurs equally, and thus the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have erred elsewhere.

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait as a recessive one.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait as a recessive one. So for example, if the bird has c (recessive for C) and B, it'll have plain body and brown color. Similarly, if it has C and b, it'll have red pigment and plain body. And if it has c and b, both traits will be absent. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. If a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), then its pigment will be red (since C is dominant) and its body will be plain (since b is recessive). Similarly, if it has c and B, pigment will be plain and body brown. And if it has c and b, both traits will be missing. Wait, but in reality, when two traits are expressed, they don\u2019t interfere. So, for a bird, the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. So, for example, a bird with C and B will have red pigment and brown body. A bird with c and B will have plain body and brown color. A bird with C and b will have red pigment and plain body. A bird with c and b will have neither. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by the probabilities of each combination.\n\nSo, given that, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1.

Both recessive\n\nNow, what's the probability of each?\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since it's always present unless recessive)\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the dominant trait. So for pigment color, any C results in red, and any c results in plain. So the probability of having pigment red is 1, regardless of c. Similarly, for body color, any B results in brown, and any b results in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene being dominant.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\nProbability = P(C dominant) * P(B dominant) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant)\nProbability = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (C recessive) and checkered (B recessive)\nProbability = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, which isn't true. Wait, no\u2014I must have made a mistake in understanding how the genes work together. Because if a bird has C (dominant), it will have red pigment, and if it also has B (dominant), it will have brown body. If it has C dominant but B recessive, it'll have red pigment and plain body. If it has C recessive but B dominant, it'll have plain pigment and brown body. And if it has both recessive, it'll have neither, i.e., plain pigment and plain body. So the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of each dominant allele.\n\nGiven that, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 100%\n- C dominant, B recessive: 0%\n- C recessive, B dominant: 0%\n- Both recessive: 0%\n\nThat seems off because in reality, some birds would have both traits expressed. Maybe I'm misapplying the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps I should consider that a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will express both traits. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red; otherwise, it'll be plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown; else, checkered. So, the presence of a dominant allele for each gene ensures the corresponding trait is expressed. Therefore, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each gene will display both traits, while a bird that has only recessive alleles won't display any.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the F2 generation will have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Both recessive: Plain and plain (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the chance of having each allele combination. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each dominant allele.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the presence of at least one dominant allele ensures the trait is expressed. So, for pigment color, the probability of expressing red is 1 (since any C allele will lead to red), and the probability of expressing plain is 0 (since all C alleles will express red). Similarly, for body color, the probability of expressing brown is 1, and the probability of expressing checkered is 0. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, the F2 generation will exhibit the four phenotypes as described above, with the respective probabilities being 100%, 0%, 0%, and 0% respectively. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this exact scenario. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. In some cases, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. But in this problem, it's stated that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, the recessive alleles do not mask the dominant ones\u2014they allow the dominant trait to manifest. Therefore, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene ensures the respective trait is expressed.\n\nIf that's the case, then all birds in the F2 generation will have both traits expressed, leading to a phenotypic ratio where all phenotypes except those where both traits are missing occur. But looking at the options provided, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This aligns with the idea that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each dominant allele.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n4. Both recessive: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the answer choices. Perhaps I'm missing something in the setup. Looking back at the problem statement: the bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB). The other bird is plain brown (cc bb). Their F2 generation is formed by selfing the F1 (which would be CcBb).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. The F1 would be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 is CcBb. Selfing F1 would produce the F2 generation, which includes four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But since each gene is independent, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nAnd the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So, in terms of phenotypic ratios, each bird would have:\n\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c recessive) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSince all birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all four phenotypes exist. However, the probabilities of these phenotypes are determined by the number of ways they can be produced.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation follows a 3:1 ratio for each gene, considering the segregation of alleles. Since there are two independent genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014the standard F2 ratio for two independently assorting genes is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, each gene is only segregating into two types (dominant or recessive), so the ratio would be different. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene in the F2 generation has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios. For pigment color (C):\n\n- 100% have red (C dominant)\n- 0% have plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- 100% have brown (B dominant)\n- 0% have checkered (b recessive)\n\nTherefore, the combined phenotypic ratio is 100% for both traits, resulting in a 100% phenotype 1, 0% phenotype 2, 0% phenotype 3, and 0% phenotype 4. But this contradicts the answer choices.\n\nLooking again at the options provided, the closest one that makes sense is option J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 100%. Let me calculate the probabilities differently. The F2 generation from CcBb x CcBb would include four types of genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. The phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. The probability of each phenotype is determined by the probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nHowever, considering the actual F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 birds (assuming selfing F1 which has 4 types of gametes, each producing 4 birds, totaling 16).\n\nGenotypes:\n\n- CC: 4 birds (25%)\n- Cc: 8 birds (50%)\n- cc: 4 birds (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- All CcBb would have both traits.\n- Cc for pigment, bb for body \u2192 red and plain.\n- cc for pigment, Bb for body \u2192 plain and brown.\n- cc for pigment, bb for body \u2192 plain and plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the F2 generation's genotypes and map them to phenotypes. For each genotype:\n\n- CC (C dominant, C dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc (c recessive, c recessive) \u2192 Checkered plain\n- bb (b recessive, b recessive) \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- CC: Has C and B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the first bird is checkered red (so checkered is recessive), implying that the phenotype depends on both alleles. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem defines:\n\n- Red pigment is dominant over plain (C)\n- Brown color is dominant over checkered (B)\n\nThe birds' colors are determined by the alleles:\n\n- Checkered (c) for both coat and color.\n\nSo, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 plain\n- Any other allele (C) \u2192 red\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 plain\n- Any other allele (B) \u2192 brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B) will have both traits expressed.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red and brown? Wait, no\u2014the problem defines checkered as the recessive phenotype for both traits. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits being expressed.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminology is confusing me. Let me redefine:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) dominant, c (plain) recessive\n- Body color: B (brown) dominant, b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body will have both traits expressed. Otherwise, it won't.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, plain body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain, plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (all C alleles lead to red)\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nThus, each bird will have both traits expressed, leading to Phenotype 1 (Checkered red and brown?), which is 100% occurrence. However, none of the answer choices reflect this. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nPerhaps the problem refers to the recessive phenotype as the opposite of dominant. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant over plain, so dominant is red, recessive is plain. Similarly, brown is dominant over checkered, so dominant is brown, recessive is checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotype classes are defined based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles, but with the recessive phenotype taking precedence. Hmm, that complicates things further. Alternatively, maybe the recessive phenotype is when both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nBut without clear definitions, it's challenging. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nAssuming that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, with the recessive phenotype (checkered) occurring when both alleles are recessive. So, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Checkered (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Checkered (c recessive) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- 100% have C (red)\n- 0% have c (plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- 100% have B (brown)\n- 0% have b (checkered)\n\nThus, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) occurs 100% of the time. Phenotypes 2, 3, and 4 occur 0% of the time. Again, none of the answer choices reflect this, indicating that perhaps the problem considers the recessive phenotype as when at least one allele is recessive for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the recessive phenotype takes precedence, so a bird with at least one dominant allele will express the dominant trait, and only when both alleles are recessive does the recessive trait take effect. But that wouldn't explain the presence of both traits in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of dominance, such as recessive silencing rather than masking. But without explicit instructions, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the answer choices, perhaps the intended solution is to consider that each gene's recessive phenotype takes precedence, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined across genes.\n\nBut since there are two independent genes, the total ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but applied to both. However, that doesn't fit the answer choices either.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem treats each trait separately, leading to phenotypic ratios based on the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait. For example, the F2 generation would have 9 possible combinations of dominant (R, B) and recessive (r, b) for each trait, leading to 3x3=9 phenotypic classes, but many of these may overlap.\n\nBut without specific instructions, it's difficult to determine. Given the answer choices, perhaps the intended approach is to consider that each bird has two separate traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, leading to certain phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the F2 generation exhibits a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but the phenotypic ratios combine to give certain counts. For instance, if each trait is independent, the phenotypic ratios could add up to the total number of birds.\n\nBut without precise rules, it's tricky. Given the answer choices, I'll proceed with the assumption that the problem requires calculating the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution, considering each trait separately and then combining them.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since there are two independent genes, the combined ratio is 9x9 = 81 possible combinations, but phenotypes would overlap",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait as a recessive one. So for example, if the bird has c (recessive for C) and B, it'll have plain body and brown color. Similarly, if it has C and b, it'll have red pigment and plain body. And if it has c and b, both traits will be absent. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. If a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), then its pigment will be red (since C is dominant) and its body will be plain (since b is recessive). Similarly, if it has c and B, pigment will be plain and body brown. And if it has c and b, both traits will be missing. Wait, but in reality, when two traits are expressed, they don\u2019t interfere. So, for a bird, the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. So, for example, a bird with C and B will have red pigment and brown body. A bird with c and B will have plain body and brown color. A bird with C and b will have red pigment and plain body. A bird with c and b will have neither. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by the probabilities of each combination.\n\nSo, given that, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: C (dominant) and B (dominant)\n2. C dominant, B recessive\n3. C recessive, B dominant\n4. Both recessive\n\nNow, what's the probability of each?\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since it's always present unless recessive)\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the dominant trait. So for pigment color, any C results in red, and any c results in plain. So the probability of having pigment red is 1, regardless of c. Similarly, for body color, any B results in brown, and any b results in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene being dominant.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\nProbability = P(C dominant) * P(B dominant) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant)\nProbability = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (C recessive) and checkered (B recessive)\nProbability = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, which isn't true. Wait, no\u2014I must have made a mistake in understanding how the genes work together. Because if a bird has C (dominant), it will have red pigment, and if it also has B (dominant), it will have brown body. If it has C dominant but B recessive, it'll have red pigment and plain body. If it has C recessive but B dominant, it'll have plain pigment and brown body. And if it has both recessive, it'll have neither, i.e., plain pigment and plain body. So the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of each dominant allele.\n\nGiven that, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 100%\n- C dominant, B recessive: 0%\n- C recessive, B dominant: 0%\n- Both recessive: 0%\n\nThat seems off because in reality, some birds would have both traits expressed. Maybe I'm misapplying the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps I should consider that a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will express both traits. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red; otherwise, it'll be plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown; else, checkered. So, the presence of a dominant allele for each gene ensures the corresponding trait is expressed. Therefore, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each gene will display both traits, while a bird that has only recessive alleles won't display any.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the F2 generation will have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Both recessive: Plain and plain (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the chance of having each allele combination. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each dominant allele.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the presence of at least one dominant allele ensures the trait is expressed. So, for pigment color, the probability of expressing red is 1 (since any C allele will lead to red), and the probability of expressing plain is 0 (since all C alleles will express red). Similarly, for body color, the probability of expressing brown is 1, and the probability of expressing checkered is 0. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThus, the F2 generation will exhibit the four phenotypes as described above, with the respective probabilities being 100%, 0%, 0%, and 0% respectively. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this exact scenario. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. In some cases, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. But in this problem, it's stated that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, the recessive alleles do not mask the dominant ones\u2014they allow the dominant trait to manifest. Therefore, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene ensures the respective trait is expressed.\n\nIf that's the case, then all birds in the F2 generation will have both traits expressed, leading to a phenotypic ratio where all phenotypes except those where both traits are missing occur. But looking at the options provided, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This aligns with the idea that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each dominant allele.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n4. Both recessive: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the answer choices. Perhaps I'm missing something in the setup. Looking back at the problem statement: the bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB). The other bird is plain brown (cc bb). Their F2 generation is formed by selfing the F1 (which would be CcBb).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. The F1 would be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 is CcBb. Selfing F1 would produce the F2 generation, which includes four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But since each gene is independent, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nAnd the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So, in terms of phenotypic ratios, each bird would have:\n\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c recessive) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSince all birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all four phenotypes exist. However, the probabilities of these phenotypes are determined by the number of ways they can be produced.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation follows a 3:1 ratio for each gene, considering the segregation of alleles. Since there are two independent genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014the standard F2 ratio for two independently assorting genes is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, each gene is only segregating into two types (dominant or recessive), so the ratio would be different. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene in the F2 generation has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive. Since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios. For pigment color (C):\n\n- 100% have red (C dominant)\n- 0% have plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- 100% have brown (B dominant)\n- 0% have checkered (b recessive)\n\nTherefore, the combined phenotypic ratio is 100% for both traits, resulting in a 100% phenotype 1, 0% phenotype 2, 0% phenotype 3, and 0% phenotype 4. But this contradicts the answer choices.\n\nLooking again at the options provided, the closest one that makes sense is option J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 100%. Let me calculate the probabilities differently. The F2 generation from CcBb x CcBb would include four types of genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. The phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. The probability of each phenotype is determined by the probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nHowever, considering the actual F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 birds (assuming selfing F1 which has 4 types of gametes, each producing 4 birds, totaling 16).\n\nGenotypes:\n\n- CC: 4 birds (25%)\n- Cc: 8 birds (50%)\n- cc: 4 birds (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- All CcBb would have both traits.\n- Cc for pigment, bb for body \u2192 red and plain.\n- cc for pigment, Bb for body \u2192 plain and brown.\n- cc for pigment, bb for body \u2192 plain and plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the F2 generation's genotypes and map them to phenotypes. For each genotype:\n\n- CC (C dominant, C dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc (c recessive, c recessive) \u2192 Checkered plain\n- bb (b recessive, b recessive) \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- CC: Has C and B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the first bird is checkered red (so checkered is recessive), implying that the phenotype depends on both alleles. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem defines:\n\n- Red pigment is dominant over plain (C)\n- Brown color is dominant over checkered (B)\n\nThe birds' colors are determined by the alleles:\n\n- Checkered (c) for both coat and color.\n\nSo, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 plain\n- Any other allele (C) \u2192 red\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 plain\n- Any other allele (B) \u2192 brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B) will have both traits expressed.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Checkered red and brown? Wait, no\u2014the problem defines checkered as the recessive phenotype for both traits. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits being expressed.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminology is confusing me. Let me redefine:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) dominant, c (plain) recessive\n- Body color: B (brown) dominant, b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body will have both traits expressed. Otherwise, it won't.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, plain body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain, plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (all C alleles lead to red)\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nThus, each bird will have both traits expressed, leading to Phenotype 1 (Checkered red and brown?), which is 100% occurrence. However, none of the answer choices reflect this. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nPerhaps the problem refers to the recessive phenotype as the opposite of dominant. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant over plain, so dominant is red, recessive is plain. Similarly, brown is dominant over checkered, so dominant is brown, recessive is checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotype classes are defined based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles, but with the recessive phenotype taking precedence. Hmm, that complicates things further. Alternatively, maybe the recessive phenotype is when both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nBut without clear definitions, it's challenging. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nAssuming that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, with the recessive phenotype (checkered) occurring when both alleles are recessive. So, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Checkered (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Checkered (c recessive) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- 100% have C (red)\n- 0% have c (plain)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- 100% have B (brown)\n- 0% have b (checkered)\n\nThus, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) occurs 100% of the time. Phenotypes 2, 3, and 4 occur 0% of the time. Again, none of the answer choices reflect this, indicating that perhaps the problem considers the recessive phenotype as when at least one allele is recessive for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the recessive phenotype takes precedence, so a bird with at least one dominant allele will express the dominant trait, and only when both alleles are recessive does the recessive trait take effect. But that wouldn't explain the presence of both traits in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of dominance, such as recessive silencing rather than masking. But without explicit instructions, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the answer choices, perhaps the intended solution is to consider that each gene's recessive phenotype takes precedence, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but combined across genes.\n\nBut since there are two independent genes, the total ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but applied to both. However, that doesn't fit the answer choices either.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem treats each trait separately, leading to phenotypic ratios based on the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait. For example, the F2 generation would have 9 possible combinations of dominant (R, B) and recessive (r, b) for each trait, leading to 3x3=9 phenotypic classes, but many of these may overlap.\n\nBut without specific instructions, it's difficult to determine. Given the answer choices, perhaps the intended approach is to consider that each bird has two separate traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, leading to certain phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the F2 generation exhibits a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but the phenotypic ratios combine to give certain counts. For instance, if each trait is independent, the phenotypic ratios could add up to the total number of birds.\n\nBut without precise rules, it's tricky. Given the answer choices, I'll proceed with the assumption that the problem requires calculating the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation's genotype distribution, considering each trait separately and then combining them.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since there are two independent genes, the combined ratio is 9x9 = 81 possible combinations, but phenotypes would overlap",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

    "rollout": " But in reality, a bird can have either red or plain for pigment, depending on the C gene, and either brown or checkered for body color, depending on the B gene.

C (dominant) and B (recessive): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain, Brown\n4. c (recessive) and B (recessive): Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these has a certain probability based on the parents' genotypes. Since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each of the four phenotypic combinations, but weighted by the number of each trait. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't accurate. Instead, we should consider the inheritance of each gene separately and then combine them. Each gene is inherited independently. So for the C locus, the possible outcomes are C (red) or c (plain), each with a probability of 3/4 and 1/4 respectively. Similarly, for the B locus, B (brown) or b (checkered), each with probability 3/4 and 1/4. Since the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 3: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 4: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, adding up all the probabilities for each phenotype:\nTotal = 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to Phenotypes 1 through 4 respectively.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean every bird has both traits, which isn't the case. Let me correct that. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the probability of having brown is 1 (since any B gives brown). Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, which is impossible because that would imply all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds don't have one trait even if they have another.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The correct approach is to consider each trait separately and then combine them. So, for pigment color (C):\n\n- C: pigment red (probability 1)\n- c: plain (probability 0)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B: brown (probability 1)\n- b: checkered (probability 0)\n\nTherefore, the only possible phenotype that combines both traits is Pigment red and Brown. All other combinations involve either not having one trait or the other. Thus, the entire F2 population will exhibit the Pigment red and Brown phenotype, which would correspond to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to reflect this. This suggests that perhaps I've misunderstood the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the distribution of phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes' effects without necessarily implying that both traits must be expressed. Wait, but given the way the question is phrased, \"phenotypic ratio,\" it's likely referring to the actual expression of the traits, where each bird may or may not display both traits based on their alleles.\n\nWait, but according to the previous analysis, all birds would have both traits because both genes are dominant. That seems counterintuitive. Maybe I misinterpreted the genes. Let me double-check: The problem states that \"red\" is controlled by C, \"checkered\" by c; \"brown\" by B, \"checkered\" by b. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it'll have those traits. Therefore, every bird in this scenario would have both traits, leading to a 100% Pigment red and Brown phenotype. But looking at the options, option D mentions a checkered red, plain red, etc.\u2014so perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the presence of the dominant allele for one trait doesn't automatically ensure the presence of the dominant allele for the other trait. For example, a bird could have pigment red (C) but not brown (b), making it checkered. Similarly, a bird could have brown (B) but not red (c), making it plain. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive\n\nEach of these would have different probabilities. Let's calculate each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive. Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: c recessive, B dominant. Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: c recessive, b recessive. Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that still sums up to 100% Pigment red and Brown, which again seems odd. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of birds that have each specific combination of traits, regardless of dominance. In that case, each bird would have exactly one trait unless both are dominant. Wait, that's confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined by a separate gene, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. However, in reality, if both traits are expressed, the bird will display both. But if only one trait is expressed, it'll display that single trait. Wait, but in this case, each bird has both traits because both genes are dominant. That suggests that all birds in this scenario would display both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%. But this isn't reflected in any of the answer choices except option E, which also shows a 3:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the frequency of each phenotype based on the combination of the two genes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. That is, each bird will have one trait unless both are recessive, but that's not applicable here because both genes are dominant. So all birds will have both traits, resulting in a 100% Pigment red and Brown phenotype. Looking at the options, none directly state this. Option A is 6:6:2:2 for different phenotypes, which doesn't align with my earlier conclusion.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine it. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Maybe the issue lies in how the phenotypes are being counted based on the presence of dominant alleles, rather than the combination of both traits. For instance, a bird could have pigment red but not brown, making it plain red, or have brown but not red, making it checkered brown. Alternatively, a bird could have both traits expressed as Pigment red and Brown, Pigment red and Checkered, Checkered and Brown, or Checkered and Checkered. \n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be categorized based on the presence of each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities for each category:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (Pigment red and Brown):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red but not brown (Checkered):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Brown but not red (Plain):\n   - Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Neither trait expressed (Checkered and Checkered):\n   - Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nAgain, this results in 100% Pigment red and Brown, which doesn't match any answer choice. I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the actual expression of the traits, where a bird might have one trait if it has at least one dominant allele for that trait, but not necessarily both. For example, a bird with C (p pigment red) and c (checkered) would have Pigment red and Checkered, not Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, a bird with B (brown) and b (checkered) would have Brown and Checkered. Only birds with both dominant alleles would have both Pigment red and Brown.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = 1*1=1\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Probability = 1*0=0\n3. Brown and Checkered: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Probability = 0*1=0\n4. Checkered and Checkered: c and b recessive \u2192 Probability = 0*0=0\n\nStill, this results in 100% Pigment red and Brown, which doesn't fit any answer choice. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should instead look for standard Punnett squares and phenotypic ratios for dihybrids.\n\nTypically, for two independent genes each with two alleles (dominant and recessive), the F2 generation phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where each term represents a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits. However, in our case, each bird displays two traits, so the breakdown would be into four categories: both traits expressed, Pigment red only, Brown only, and neither. Based on the standard dihybrid cross, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. Let's see:\n\nAssuming each trait has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), the combined ratios would be 9:3:3:1. For example:\n\n- 9/16 have both traits expressed.\n- 3/16 have Pigment red only.\n- 3/16 have Brown only.\n- 1/16 have neither.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one trait, excluding the cases where neither is present. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3, which adds up to 15, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on the presence of one trait, excluding the other, leading to a 3:1 ratio, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each bird has two traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio is 100% Pigment red and Brown, followed by zero for others. But this doesn't align with the answer choices provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the distribution of each trait individually, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each gene. For example, for pigment color:\n\n- 3/4 have Pigment red (C dominant)\n- 1/4 have plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- 3/4 have Brown (B dominant)\n- 1/4 have Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratio would then be the product of these probabilities, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio across all combinations. But again, this doesn't neatly divide into the given options. \n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, plain red 2, checkered brown 2, plain brown 6\nOption B: Checkered red 8, plain red 4, checkered brown 0, plain brown 4\nOption C: Checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1\nOption D: Checkered red 1, plain red 3, checkered brown 9, plain brown 3\nOption E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3\n\nFrom what I understand, the correct answer should reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since that's not among the options, perhaps the question is simplified, and the focus is on the presence of each trait rather than both. In that case, for pigment red, the ratio would be 3:1 (3 dominant, 1 recessive), and similarly for brown. The combined phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 3*3=9\n- Pigment red only: 3*1=3\n- Brown only: 1*3=3\n- Neither: 1*1=1\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this exact format. However, if we ignore the 'neither' category and sum the non-zero ones, it becomes 9+3+3=15, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each trait independently and multiply their probabilities. For pigment red:\n\n- 3/4 chance of Pigment red (C dominant)\n- 1/4 chance of plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- 3/4 chance of Brown (B dominant)\n- 1/4 chance of Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Checkered and Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't listed, perhaps the question expects us to count each trait separately without considering both together, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait. However, the options include ratios like 1, 2, 3, 6, etc., suggesting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, disregarding dominance, treating each bird as displaying both traits if they have at least one dominant allele for each. This would lead to a 100% Pigment red and Brown, but that's not an option either. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I think the intended answer is option C: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This comes from the assumption that each trait's presence is considered separately, with checkered appearing in 9/16, plain in 3/16, and so on, though this is inconsistent with the typical dihybrid ratios. However, option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering the number of birds with each phenotype, assuming each bird contributes equally to each category. Despite the uncertainty, I'll go with option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean every bird has both traits, which isn't the case. Let me correct that. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the probability of having brown is 1 (since any B gives brown). Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1, which is impossible because that would imply all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds don't have one trait even if they have another.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake.

That seems counterintuitive. Maybe I misinterpreted the genes. Let me double-check: The problem states that \"red\" is controlled by C, \"checkered\" by c; \"brown\" by B, \"checkered\" by b. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it'll have those traits. Therefore, every bird in this scenario would have both traits, leading to a 100% Pigment red and Brown phenotype. But looking at the options, option D mentions a checkered red, plain red, etc.\u2014so perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the presence of the dominant allele for one trait doesn't automatically ensure the presence of the dominant allele for the other trait. For example, a bird could have pigment red (C) but not brown (b), making it checkered. Similarly, a bird could have brown (B) but not red (c), making it plain. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive\n\nEach of these would have different probabilities. Let's calculate each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, b recessive. Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: c recessive, B dominant. Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: c recessive, b recessive. Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that still sums up to 100% Pigment red and Brown, which again seems odd. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio refers to the number of birds that have each specific combination of traits, regardless of dominance. In that case, each bird would have exactly one trait unless both are dominant. Wait, that's confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined by a separate gene, the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. However, in reality, if both traits are expressed, the bird will display both. But if only one trait is expressed, it'll display that single trait. Wait, but in this case, each bird has both traits because both genes are dominant. That suggests that all birds in this scenario would display both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%. But this isn't reflected in any of the answer choices except option E, which also shows a 3:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the frequency of each phenotype based on the combination of the two genes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. That is, each bird will have one trait unless both are recessive, but that's not applicable here because both genes are dominant. So all birds will have both traits, resulting in a 100% Pigment red and Brown phenotype. Looking at the options, none directly state this. Option A is 6:6:2:2 for different phenotypes, which doesn't align with my earlier conclusion.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine it. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Maybe the issue lies in how the phenotypes are being counted based on the presence of dominant alleles, rather than the combination of both traits. For instance, a bird could have pigment red but not brown, making it plain red, or have brown but not red, making it checkered brown. Alternatively, a bird could have both traits expressed as Pigment red and Brown, Pigment red and Checkered, Checkered and Brown, or Checkered and Checkered. \n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be categorized based on the presence of each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities for each category:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (Pigment red and Brown):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red but not brown (Checkered):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Brown but not red (Plain):\n   - Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Neither trait expressed (Checkered and Checkered):\n   - Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nAgain, this results in 100% Pigment red and Brown, which doesn't match any answer choice. I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the actual expression of the traits, where a bird might have one trait if it has at least one dominant allele for that trait, but not necessarily both. For example, a bird with C (p pigment red) and c (checkered) would have Pigment red and Checkered, not Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, a bird with B (brown) and b (checkered) would have Brown and Checkered. Only birds with both dominant alleles would have both Pigment red and Brown.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = 1*1=1\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Probability = 1*0=0\n3. Brown and Checkered: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Probability = 0*1=0\n4. Checkered and Checkered: c and b recessive \u2192 Probability = 0*0=0\n\nStill, this results in 100% Pigment red and Brown, which doesn't fit any answer choice. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should instead look for standard Punnett squares and phenotypic ratios for dihybrids.\n\nTypically, for two independent genes each with two alleles (dominant and recessive), the F2 generation phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where each term represents a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits. However, in our case, each bird displays two traits, so the breakdown would be into four categories: both traits expressed, Pigment red only, Brown only, and neither. Based on the standard dihybrid cross, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. Let's see:\n\nAssuming each trait has a 3:1 ratio (dominant to recessive), the combined ratios would be 9:3:3:1. For example:\n\n- 9/16 have both traits expressed.\n- 3/16 have Pigment red only.\n- 3/16 have Brown only.\n- 1/16 have neither.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one trait, excluding the cases where neither is present. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3, which adds up to 15, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on the presence of one trait, excluding the other, leading to a 3:1 ratio, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that each bird has two traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio is 100% Pigment red and Brown, followed by zero for others. But this doesn't align with the answer choices provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the distribution of each trait individually, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each gene. For example, for pigment color:\n\n- 3/4 have Pigment red (C dominant)\n- 1/4 have plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- 3/4 have Brown (B dominant)\n- 1/4 have Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratio would then be the product of these probabilities, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio across all combinations. But again, this doesn't neatly divide into the given options. \n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, plain red 2, checkered brown 2, plain brown 6\nOption B: Checkered red 8, plain red 4, checkered brown 0, plain brown 4\nOption C: Checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1\nOption D: Checkered red 1, plain red 3, checkered brown 9, plain brown 3\nOption E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3\n\nFrom what I understand, the correct answer should reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since that's not among the options, perhaps the question is simplified, and the focus is on the presence of each trait rather than both. In that case, for pigment red, the ratio would be 3:1 (3 dominant, 1 recessive), and similarly for brown. The combined phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 3*3=9\n- Pigment red only: 3*1=3\n- Brown only: 1*3=3\n- Neither: 1*1=1\n\nAdding up to 16 birds, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Again, none of the options match this exact format. However, if we ignore the 'neither' category and sum the non-zero ones, it becomes 9+3+3=15, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each trait independently and multiply their probabilities. For pigment red:\n\n- 3/4 chance of Pigment red (C dominant)\n- 1/4 chance of plain (c recessive)\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- 3/4 chance of Brown (B dominant)\n- 1/4 chance of Checkered (b recessive)\n\nThe combined probabilities are:\n\n- Both Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Checkered and Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But since this isn't listed, perhaps the question expects us to count each trait separately without considering both together, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait. However, the options include ratios like 1, 2, 3, 6, etc., suggesting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, disregarding dominance, treating each bird as displaying both traits if they have at least one dominant allele for each. This would lead to a 100% Pigment red and Brown, but that's not an option either. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I think the intended answer is option C: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This comes from the assumption that each trait's presence is considered separately, with checkered appearing in 9/16, plain in 3/16, and so on, though this is inconsistent with the typical dihybrid ratios. However, option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering the number of birds with each phenotype, assuming each bird contributes equally to each category. Despite the uncertainty, I'll go with option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is missing, it'll have the other trait.",
    "rollout": " If either is missing, it'll have the other trait. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are always expressed (no epistasis issues), then every bird will express both traits. Because regardless of what alleles are present, if either gene is dominant, the respective trait is expressed. So in this scenario, all birds will have both traits. But that contradicts typical scenarios where some birds may lack one trait if the other provides a base. But according to the given information, both C and B are dominant, so all birds will display both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered is C (dominant C)\n- Plain is c (recessive c)\n- Red is B (dominant B)\n- Brown is b (recessive b)\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier understanding. So C and B are dominant over their respective recessives. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s how it was stated: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C... plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now that changes things. So for color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). And for pigment, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). So the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations of both traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered-brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 both recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, we need to determine the probabilities of each phenotype based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB (since they don't mate to produce gametes). Wait, that can\u2019t be right. Wait, no\u2014the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Wait, hold on\u2014the user provided the cross as CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, but I thought the problem had a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, looking back, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, in this cross, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive, so all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F1 would all be CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, leading to F1 being all CcBb. But wait, that doesn't fit the usual dihybrid cross setup. Maybe I misread the parents. Looking back, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, perhaps the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nThat can't be right because then F1 would all be CcBb, and F2 would follow standard dihybrid ratios. But according to the user's initial message, the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be generated by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. Using a Punnett square, we'd get four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since the parents are homozygous, all gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, checking the possible F2 genotypes: CC (red-red), Cc (red-checkered), cc (plain-plain), bb (checkered-checkered).\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC: Both genes dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Cc: Pigment dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain \u2192 red-plain\n3. cc:Plain (both recessive) \u2192 plain-plain\n4. bb:Checkered (both recessive) \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of each genotype:\n\nEach of the four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc, bb) would occur equally in the F2 generation (25% each). Now, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- CC: red-brown (phenotype A)\n- Cc: red-plain (phenotype B)\n- cc: plain-plain (phenotype C)\n- bb: checkered-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nSince each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% A : 25% B : 25% C : 25% D, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nD. 1 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nE. 3 red-brown, 9 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nF. 4 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nG. 12 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nH. 5 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nI. 7 red-brown, 5 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\n\nHmm, none of these options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Let me go back and re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! I see now. The parents are not both homozygous. One parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be based on dihybrid crosses among these F1 individuals. Therefore, the F2 would have four phenotypic classes based on the combinations of the genes. \n\nAs before, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: red-plain (phenotype 2)\n- cc: plain-plain (phenotype 3)\n- bb: checkered-checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nSince each phenotype is represented by one genotype, the phenotypic ratio would still be 25% for each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes: one affecting pigment color (C/B), and one affecting body color (b/a). \n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio depends on the dominance hierarchy. Since B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered), and C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain), the phenotypes are combinations of these. However, when both genes are involved, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. \n\nGiven that, each bird's phenotype can be red-red, red-plain, plain-plain, or checkered-checkered. Now, the dihybrid cross would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering independent assortment. However, our parents are both homozygous, leading to a different distribution.\n\nIf both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then all F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be based on a dihybrid cross within the F1. In such cases, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. However, the options don't include this. Maybe the problem isn't about the F2 of the parents themselves but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dihybrid cross formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves a dihybrid cross between F1 and another F1, but the user didn't specify that. Wait, the user's initial prompt includes a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), implying that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be their cross. But in reality, when both parents are homozygous, their F2 would have a certain ratio.\n\nHowever, given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to consider the dihybrid cross without worrying about the parents' origin, treating it as a separate dihybrid cross. Let's assume that the F2 refers to the dihybrid cross of two F1 individuals, each being CcBb. Then, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But this doesn't align with the answer options either. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to ignore the fact that both parents are homozygous and treat the dihybrid cross as a separate scenario.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c). Therefore, a bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nWhen making a dihybrid cross, the parents could be homozygous or heterozygous. Since the problem mentions a dihybrid cross, the parents must be heterozygous. Wait, but the user presented the parents as CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous. That complicates things because dihybrid crosses usually involve heterozygous parents. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the parents. Alternatively, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb.\n\nAssuming that, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be based on a dihybrid cross among F1 individuals. In this case, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this. Let me compute the phenotypic ratio based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 all offspring will be CC BB (since they can't pass on any alleles).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nThus, all F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be generated by crossing CcBb x CcBb. The Punnett square would show:\n\n- 25% CC (all C present, all B present \u2192 red-red)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red-plain)\n- 25% cb (C recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain-brown)\n- 25% bb (c and b both recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red-red \u2192 count 25%\n- Cc: red-plain \u2192 count 25%\n- cb: plain-brown \u2192 count 25%\n- bb: checkered-checkered \u2192 count 25%\n\nThis results in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the answer options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the options again, option G is 12 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero. That would imply a 12:2 ratio, which doesn't match our calculation. Option H is 5 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3 red-brown, 9 red-plain, others zero. Again, not matching. Option F is 4 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation relative to the F1 generation, rather than absolute counts.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is missing, it'll have the other trait. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are always expressed (no epistasis issues), then every bird will express both traits. Because regardless of what alleles are present, if either gene is dominant, the respective trait is expressed. So in this scenario, all birds will have both traits. But that contradicts typical scenarios where some birds may lack one trait if the other provides a base. But according to the given information, both C and B are dominant, so all birds will display both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered is C (dominant C)\n- Plain is c (recessive c)\n- Red is B (dominant B)\n- Brown is b (recessive b)\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier understanding. So C and B are dominant over their respective recessives. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s how it was stated: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C... plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\" Similarly, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now that changes things. So for color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered). And for pigment, C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). So the presence of dominant alleles in either gene leads to the respective trait.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations of both traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered-brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 both recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, we need to determine the probabilities of each phenotype based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB (since they don't mate to produce gametes). Wait, that can\u2019t be right. Wait, no\u2014the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Wait, hold on\u2014the user provided the cross as CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, but I thought the problem had a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, looking back, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, in this cross, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive, so all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F1 would all be CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, leading to F1 being all CcBb. But wait, that doesn't fit the usual dihybrid cross setup. Maybe I misread the parents. Looking back, the user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, perhaps the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant, so all offspring will be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nThat can't be right because then F1 would all be CcBb, and F2 would follow standard dihybrid ratios. But according to the user's initial message, the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be generated by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. Using a Punnett square, we'd get four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since the parents are homozygous, all gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, checking the possible F2 genotypes: CC (red-red), Cc (red-checkered), cc (plain-plain), bb (checkered-checkered).\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC: Both genes dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Cc: Pigment dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain \u2192 red-plain\n3. cc:Plain (both recessive) \u2192 plain-plain\n4. bb:Checkered (both recessive) \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of each genotype:\n\nEach of the four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc, bb) would occur equally in the F2 generation (25% each). Now, converting these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- CC: red-brown (phenotype A)\n- Cc: red-plain (phenotype B)\n- cc: plain-plain (phenotype C)\n- bb: checkered-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nSince each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% A : 25% B : 25% C : 25% D, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nD. 1 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nE. 3 red-brown, 9 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nF. 4 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nG. 12 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nH. 5 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\nI. 7 red-brown, 5 red-plain, others zero \u2192 Not matching\n\nHmm, none of these options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. Let me go back and re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! I see now. The parents are not both homozygous. One parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be based on dihybrid crosses among these F1 individuals. Therefore, the F2 would have four phenotypic classes based on the combinations of the genes. \n\nAs before, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd the corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red-red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: red-plain (phenotype 2)\n- cc: plain-plain (phenotype 3)\n- bb: checkered-checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nSince each phenotype is represented by one genotype, the phenotypic ratio would still be 25% for each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes: one affecting pigment color (C/B), and one affecting body color (b/a). \n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio depends on the dominance hierarchy. Since B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered), and C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain), the phenotypes are combinations of these. However, when both genes are involved, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. \n\nGiven that, each bird's phenotype can be red-red, red-plain, plain-plain, or checkered-checkered. Now, the dihybrid cross would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering independent assortment. However, our parents are both homozygous, leading to a different distribution.\n\nIf both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then all F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be based on a dihybrid cross within the F1. In such cases, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. However, the options don't include this. Maybe the problem isn't about the F2 of the parents themselves but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dihybrid cross formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves a dihybrid cross between F1 and another F1, but the user didn't specify that. Wait, the user's initial prompt includes a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), implying that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be their cross. But in reality, when both parents are homozygous, their F2 would have a certain ratio.\n\nHowever, given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to consider the dihybrid cross without worrying about the parents' origin, treating it as a separate dihybrid cross. Let's assume that the F2 refers to the dihybrid cross of two F1 individuals, each being CcBb. Then, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But this doesn't align with the answer options either. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to ignore the fact that both parents are homozygous and treat the dihybrid cross as a separate scenario.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c). Therefore, a bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nWhen making a dihybrid cross, the parents could be homozygous or heterozygous. Since the problem mentions a dihybrid cross, the parents must be heterozygous. Wait, but the user presented the parents as CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous. That complicates things because dihybrid crosses usually involve heterozygous parents. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the parents. Alternatively, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb.\n\nAssuming that, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be based on a dihybrid cross among F1 individuals. In this case, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this. Let me compute the phenotypic ratio based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 all offspring will be CC BB (since they can't pass on any alleles).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 all offspring will be cc bb.\n\nThus, all F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be generated by crossing CcBb x CcBb. The Punnett square would show:\n\n- 25% CC (all C present, all B present \u2192 red-red)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red-plain)\n- 25% cb (C recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain-brown)\n- 25% bb (c and b both recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red-red \u2192 count 25%\n- Cc: red-plain \u2192 count 25%\n- cb: plain-brown \u2192 count 25%\n- bb: checkered-checkered \u2192 count 25%\n\nThis results in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the answer options reflect this exactly. However, looking at the options again, option G is 12 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero. That would imply a 12:2 ratio, which doesn't match our calculation. Option H is 5 red-brown, 3 red-plain, others zero, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3 red-brown, 9 red-plain, others zero. Again, not matching. Option F is 4 red-brown, 4 red-plain, others zero. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation relative to the F1 generation, rather than absolute counts. But the question clearly asks for the F2 ratio.\n\nGiven that, I must conclude that none of the options match the 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since the options provided don't include this, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 will all be CcBb. When crossed, the F2 would have the following:\n\n- CC (25%): red-red\n- Cc (50%): red-plain\n- cc (25%): plain-brown\n- bb (25%): checkered-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% each. So, the correct answer shouldn't be listed among the options. However, looking at the options, the closest is option G: 12 red-brown, 2 red-plain, others zero. This would correspond to a ratio of 12:2, which is 6:1. But our calculation shows 25% each. Therefore, perhaps the question intended a different approach, such as considering that the parents are not homozygous but instead have different genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and CcBb, making it a dihybrid cross. But the problem states the parents as CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous. Therefore, unless I'm misunderstanding the problem, none of the options seem correct. However, given the options, the most plausible choice is option G, which represents a 12:2 ratio, possibly due to a different setup or rounding.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to select one answer, I'll choose option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This would suggest that checkered is dominant in one trait and recessive in another, but this contradicts the initial description.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

However, if a bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for either gene, it will display that trait regardless of the other gene. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This happens if at least one dominant allele exists for both genes.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs if C is dominant and B is recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs if c is dominant and B is dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs if both c and b are present.\n\nWait, but how do these combine? Let me list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes. Let's take the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) parent. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing. Each F1 bird produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So F2 would have four possible combinations: CC (CB + CB), Cc (CB + cb), cc (cb + cb), and bb (cb + cb). Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C is dominant, c is recessive): Pigment red (C) and since B is also present (B is dominant), Brown (B). So phenotype: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1.\n- Cc (C is dominant, c is recessive): Pigment red (C) and B is recessive (b), so Checkered (b). So phenotype: red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2.\n- cc (c is dominant, c is recessive): Plain (c) and B is dominant (B), so Brown (B). Phenotype 3.\n- bb (c is dominant, b is recessive): Plain (c) and B is recessive (b), so Checkered (b). Phenotype 4.\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype in the F2? Each F1 bird contributes gametes equally, so the F2 will have four types of birds: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the number of each type contributing to each phenotype. However, since some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, the actual counts might differ. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Only comes from CC and Cc, but wait no\u2014CC is phenotype 1, Cc is phenotype 2. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify: Phenotype 1 is when a bird has both dominant alleles for both genes, which is CC BB (but F2 only includes up to bb for B, so maybe not applicable). Wait, confusion arises because F2 includes all possible combinations, including those where only one gene is dominant.\n\nLet me instead look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3 (Plain & Checkered)\n- CC bb (wait, no, F2 includes only up to bb for B)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Checkered? Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive, it's checkered, and if B is dominant, it's brown. Similarly for C.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Each bird in F2 has two alleles for pigment and two for color. Their phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C: Pigment red\n  - c: Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B: Brown\n  - b: Checkered\n\nThe phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed. A bird will exhibit both traits only if both C and B are dominant. Otherwise, it exhibits only one trait.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red & Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Red & Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant (c and B): Plain & Brown\n4. Both recessive (c and b): Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of these four phenotypes. To find the ratio, we consider the probabilities of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nSince each F1 bird contributes gametes CB and cb equally, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown)\n2. 25% CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n3. 25% Cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n4. 25% Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Checkered)\n5. 25% cc BB: Phenotype 3 (Plain & Brown)\n6. 25% cc Bb: Phenotype 4 (Plain & Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because Cc Bb would have c for C and Bb for B. So for C: c is recessive, so plain. For B: B is dominant, so brown. So Phenotype 3 is Checkered & Brown, not Checkered & Checkered. Similarly, cc BB: c for C, B dominant \u2192 Plain & Brown. cc Bb: c for C, B recessive \u2192 Plain & Checkered. CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. Now, let's count how many fall under each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb and Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Cc Bb and cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4: cc Bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's counting the number of birds for each genotype, not the phenotypes directly. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. So the actual number of birds in each phenotype category isn't straightforward because multiple genotypes can lead to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Punnett square method. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\n```\n          | Cc | Cc\n----------|----|----\n        CB | CcBb |\n        cb | CcBb |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (from CB x CB), Cc (from CB x cb), cc (from cb x cb), and bb (from cb x cb). The phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (C dominant, c recessive): Pigment red, B dominant (B) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red & Brown\n- Cc (C dominant, c recessive): Pigment red, B recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red & Checkered\n- cc (c dominant, c recessive): Pigment plain, B dominant (B) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain & Brown\n- cc (c dominant, c recessive): Pigment plain, B recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, each F2 bird is a combination of these four possibilities, each with a certain probability. The F2 generation will have 25% of each genotype, so each phenotype will correspond to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nHowever, since some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype, the actual counts aren't 1:1. For example, both CC BB and CC Bb will result in Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown), but CC BB has a higher chance of being phenotypically similar than CC Bb. Wait, but in terms of the F2 population, each bird is randomly selected, so the overall count for each phenotype is based on the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nLet me count the number of birds for each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Genotypes CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): Genotypes Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Brown): Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered & Checkered): Genotype cc BB \u2192 1 bird (Wait, no\u2014cc BB is Phenotype 3, as above. So actually, cc BB is Phenotype 3, not 4. Wait, confusion arises.)\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because Cc BB and Cc Bb are Phenotype 2, while cc BB and cc Bb are Phenotype 3, and cc bb is Phenotype 4. And CC BB and CC Bb are Phenotype 1, along with Cc BB and Cc Bb.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled. Let's map it properly:\n\nEach bird in F2 has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). The phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C: Pigment red\n  - c: Plain\n- For color (B):\n  - B: Brown\n  - b: Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Red & Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Red & Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain & Brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have 25% of each possible genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- CC bb (same as above)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 2\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014the four possible combinations are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- CC bb (same as above)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but some genotypes share the same phenotype. For instance, CC BB and CC Bb both result in Phenotype 1. Similarly, CC bb results in Phenotype 3. So the actual count of each phenotype depends on how many genotypes contribute to them.\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratio, we need to sum the number of birds for each phenotype. Since each F1 bird contributes gametes CB and cb in equal numbers, the F2 will have four types of birds, each with 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by their combinations:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant. In the F2, this can happen if the bird has CC and BB, CC and Bb, Cc and BB, or Cc and Bb. However, some of these are part of different genotypes. Specifically:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n  - CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm mixing up. Let me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These four genotypes all result in Phenotype 1.\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Two genotypes \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Phenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 Two genotypes \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Phenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 One genotype \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, each of these phenotypes corresponds to multiple genotypes. However, since each bird is randomly selected, the actual number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 4/16 = 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 2 genotypes (Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3: 2 genotypes (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 12.5%\n- Phenotype 4: 1 genotype (cc bb) \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but this seems off because the sum should be 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal genotypes = 16 (4 x 4).\n\nPhenotype 1: 4 genotypes \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: 2 genotypes \u2192 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: 2 genotypes \u2192 12.5%\nPhenotype 4: 1 genotype \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. Clearly, something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in counting the genotypes.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nEach bird in F2 can be categorized into four phenotypes based on their genotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Genotypes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 genotypes\n2. Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): Genotypes Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n3. Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Brown): Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n4. Phenotype 4 (Checkered & Checkered): Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 genotype\n\nBut adding these up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which still doesn't add up to 16. Wait, I'm missing some genotypes. Oh, no\u2014I forgot that in F2, the possible genotypes are more than four. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross has 16 possible genotypes, each with equal probability. Let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (same as above)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n10. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's 10 distinct genotypes, but there are only 16 possible combinations (since each gene has two alleles, and for two genes, 2^2 = 4, so 4^2 = 16 combinations). I'm making a mistake here. Let me systematically list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n10. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's only nine unique genotypes. But there are 16 possible combinations. I'm missing some. Let me correct:\n\nActually, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC, Cc, cc\nGene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations: 3 (for C) x 3 (for B) = 9 possible genotypes. But since each gene has two alleles, the actual number of unique genotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Wait, but that can't be because for two genes, each with two alleles, the number of possible genotypes is (n+1)^2, where n is the number of alleles. Here, n=2 for each gene, so (2+1)^2=9 possible genotypes. Correct.\n\nSo the 9 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each to their phenotypes:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: CC BB\n2. Phenotype 2: CC Bb and Cc BB\n3. Phenotype 3: CC bb, Cc Bb, cc BB\n4. Phenotype 4: Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, if a bird has both dominant alleles for both genes, it will display both traits. However, if a bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for either gene, it will display that trait regardless of the other gene. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This happens if at least one dominant allele exists for both genes.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs if C is dominant and B is recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs if c is dominant and B is dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs if both c and b are present.\n\nWait, but how do these combine? Let me list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes. Let's take the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) parent. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing. Each F1 bird produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So F2 would have four possible combinations: CC (CB + CB), Cc (CB + cb), cc (cb + cb), and bb (cb + cb). Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C is dominant, c is recessive): Pigment red (C) and since B is also present (B is dominant), Brown (B). So phenotype: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1.\n- Cc (C is dominant, c is recessive): Pigment red (C) and B is recessive (b), so Checkered (b). So phenotype: red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2.\n- cc (c is dominant, c is recessive): Plain (c) and B is dominant (B), so Brown (B). Phenotype 3.\n- bb (c is dominant, b is recessive): Plain (c) and B is recessive (b), so Checkered (b). Phenotype 4.\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype in the F2? Each F1 bird contributes gametes equally, so the F2 will have four types of birds: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the number of each type contributing to each phenotype. However, since some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, the actual counts might differ. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Only comes from CC and Cc, but wait no\u2014CC is phenotype 1, Cc is phenotype 2. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify: Phenotype 1 is when a bird has both dominant alleles for both genes, which is CC BB (but F2 only includes up to bb for B, so maybe not applicable). Wait, confusion arises because F2 includes all possible combinations, including those where only one gene is dominant.\n\nLet me instead look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3 (Plain & Checkered)\n- CC bb (wait, no, F2 includes only up to bb for B)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Checkered? Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive, it's checkered, and if B is dominant, it's brown. Similarly for C.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Each bird in F2 has two alleles for pigment and two for color. Their phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C: Pigment red\n  - c: Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B: Brown\n  - b: Checkered\n\nThe phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed. A bird will exhibit both traits only if both C and B are dominant. Otherwise, it exhibits only one trait.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red & Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Red & Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant (c and B): Plain & Brown\n4. Both recessive (c and b): Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of these four phenotypes. To find the ratio, we consider the probabilities of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nSince each F1 bird contributes gametes CB and cb equally, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. 25% CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown)\n2. 25% CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n3. 25% Cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered)\n4. 25% Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Checkered)\n5. 25% cc BB: Phenotype 3 (Plain & Brown)\n6. 25% cc Bb: Phenotype 4 (Plain & Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because Cc Bb would have c for C and Bb for B. So for C: c is recessive, so plain. For B: B is dominant, so brown. So Phenotype 3 is Checkered & Brown, not Checkered & Checkered. Similarly, cc BB: c for C, B dominant \u2192 Plain & Brown. cc Bb: c for C, B recessive \u2192 Plain & Checkered. CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. Now, let's count how many fall under each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb and Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Cc Bb and cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4: cc Bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's counting the number of birds for each genotype, not the phenotypes directly. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. So the actual number of birds in each phenotype category isn't straightforward because multiple genotypes can lead to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Punnett square method. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\n```\n          | Cc | Cc\n----------|----|----\n        CB | CcBb |\n        cb | CcBb |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (from CB x CB), Cc (from CB x cb), cc (from cb x cb), and bb (from cb x cb). The phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC (C dominant, c recessive): Pigment red, B dominant (B) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red & Brown\n- Cc (C dominant, c recessive): Pigment red, B recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red & Checkered\n- cc (c dominant, c recessive): Pigment plain, B dominant (B) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain & Brown\n- cc (c dominant, c recessive): Pigment plain, B recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, each F2 bird is a combination of these four possibilities, each with a certain probability. The F2 generation will have 25% of each genotype, so each phenotype will correspond to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nHowever, since some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype, the actual counts aren't 1:1. For example, both CC BB and CC Bb will result in Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown), but CC BB has a higher chance of being phenotypically similar than CC Bb. Wait, but in terms of the F2 population, each bird is randomly selected, so the overall count for each phenotype is based on the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nLet me count the number of birds for each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Genotypes CC BB, CC Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): Genotypes Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Brown): Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered & Checkered): Genotype cc BB \u2192 1 bird (Wait, no\u2014cc BB is Phenotype 3, as above. So actually, cc BB is Phenotype 3, not 4. Wait, confusion arises.)\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because Cc BB and Cc Bb are Phenotype 2, while cc BB and cc Bb are Phenotype 3, and cc bb is Phenotype 4. And CC BB and CC Bb are Phenotype 1, along with Cc BB and Cc Bb.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled. Let's map it properly:\n\nEach bird in F2 has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). The phenotype is determined by whether each trait is expressed.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C: Pigment red\n  - c: Plain\n- For color (B):\n  - B: Brown\n  - b: Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Red & Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Red & Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain & Brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain & Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have 25% of each possible genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- CC bb (same as above)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 2\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 4\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014the four possible combinations are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- CC bb (same as above)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but some genotypes share the same phenotype. For instance, CC BB and CC Bb both result in Phenotype 1. Similarly, CC bb results in Phenotype 3. So the actual count of each phenotype depends on how many genotypes contribute to them.\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratio, we need to sum the number of birds for each phenotype. Since each F1 bird contributes gametes CB and cb in equal numbers, the F2 will have four types of birds, each with 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by their combinations:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Occurs when both C and B are dominant. In the F2, this can happen if the bird has CC and BB, CC and Bb, Cc and BB, or Cc and Bb. However, some of these are part of different genotypes. Specifically:\n\n  - CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n  - CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n  - Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n  - Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm mixing up. Let me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These four genotypes all result in Phenotype 1.\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Two genotypes \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Phenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 Two genotypes \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Phenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 One genotype \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, each of these phenotypes corresponds to multiple genotypes. However, since each bird is randomly selected, the actual number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 4/16 = 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 2 genotypes (Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 2/16 = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3: 2 genotypes (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 12.5%\n- Phenotype 4: 1 genotype (cc bb) \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but this seems off because the sum should be 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal genotypes = 16 (4 x 4).\n\nPhenotype 1: 4 genotypes \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: 2 genotypes \u2192 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: 2 genotypes \u2192 12.5%\nPhenotype 4: 1 genotype \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. Clearly, something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in counting the genotypes.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nEach bird in F2 can be categorized into four phenotypes based on their genotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (Red & Brown): Genotypes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 genotypes\n2. Phenotype 2 (Red & Checkered): Genotypes Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n3. Phenotype 3 (Checkered & Brown): Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n4. Phenotype 4 (Checkered & Checkered): Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 genotype\n\nBut adding these up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which still doesn't add up to 16. Wait, I'm missing some genotypes. Oh, no\u2014I forgot that in F2, the possible genotypes are more than four. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross has 16 possible genotypes, each with equal probability. Let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (same as above)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n10. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's 10 distinct genotypes, but there are only 16 possible combinations (since each gene has two alleles, and for two genes, 2^2 = 4, so 4^2 = 16 combinations). I'm making a mistake here. Let me systematically list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n10. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's only nine unique genotypes. But there are 16 possible combinations. I'm missing some. Let me correct:\n\nActually, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC, Cc, cc\nGene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations: 3 (for C) x 3 (for B) = 9 possible genotypes. But since each gene has two alleles, the actual number of unique genotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Wait, but that can't be because for two genes, each with two alleles, the number of possible genotypes is (n+1)^2, where n is the number of alleles. Here, n=2 for each gene, so (2+1)^2=9 possible genotypes. Correct.\n\nSo the 9 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each to their phenotypes:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: CC BB\n2. Phenotype 2: CC Bb and Cc BB\n3. Phenotype 3: CC bb, Cc Bb, cc BB\n4. Phenotype 4: Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, if the bird has C and B, it'll have both traits.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, if the bird has C and B, it'll have both traits. If it has C and b, it'll have pigment red and checkered. Similarly, c and B gives plain and brown, while c and b gives plain and checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But that's not possible because not all birds will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't correct. Instead, we should consider that for each bird, the combination of C and B determines the phenotype. Since C and B are separate genes, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both. So the actual probability is calculated based on the genetic makeup.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using a Punnett square considering the F2 generation. Since the F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, we can create the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb. It produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, actually, since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are only CB and cb. Because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes, each occurring at 50%.\n\nTherefore, when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square would then look like this:\n\n```\n        | CB    | cb\n      -----------------\n CB     | CcBB | Ccbb\n cb     | CcBB | c c bb\n```\n\nSo the F2 generation consists of four types of birds: CcBB (25%), Ccbb (25%), ccBB (25%), and ccbb (25%). Now, we need to determine the phenotypes of these birds based on the genes.\n\nLet's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n- Ccbb:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - Phenotype: Plain Red\n\n- ccBB:\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- ccbb:\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four genotypes, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, since each bird can express multiple traits, we need to consider how many birds exhibit each phenotype.\n\nEach bird can have up to two traits. The phenotypic ratios are often expressed in terms of the combination of traits, but sometimes simplified into the number of each trait. However, in this case, each bird's phenotype is a combination of two traits. To simplify, we can categorize the phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Both traits expressed: Checkered Red and Checkered Brown\n2. Pigment expressed but not body: Checkered Red and Plain\n3. Plain but expressed pigment: Plain Red and Checkered\n4. Neither expressed: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities accurately. Another way is to count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Only the birds with C (pigment) and B (brown) alleles. In the F2, this is 25% of the population.\n- **Plain Red**: Birds with C (pigeon) but not B. This is 25%.\n- **Checkered Brown**: Birds without C (so cc) but with B. Also 25%.\n- **Plain Brown**: Without C (cc) and without B (bb). 25%.\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 100%, but in reality, some birds may have all three traits or none. However, given the dominance hierarchy, if an animal has C, it'll have pigment red, regardless of the B trait. Similarly, if it has B, it'll have brown. So the four phenotypes are accurate.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option E says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows each phenotype should occur equally, not differing in numbers. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, that's unequal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation. Let me re-examine. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square should be:\n\n```\n        | CB     | cb\n      ---------------\n CB     | CcBB  | Ccbb\n cb     | CcBB  | ccBB\n```\n\nSo the F2 is 25% CcBB, 25% Ccbb, 25% ccBB, 25% ccbb. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered Red (both C and B dominant)\n- Ccbb: Plain Red (only C dominant, B recessive)\n- ccBB: Checkered Brown (only c, B dominant)\n- ccbb: Plain Brown (no C, no B)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each phenotype occurs once in every four birds. So the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect this. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the question is asking for the F2 generation after two generations of crossing F1 with F1, which results in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes two alleles for each gene. Let me try recalculating.\n\nIf each parent is heterozygous for both genes, say Parent A is CcBB and Parent B is ccbb, then the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. As before, the F2 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb. The phenotypes remain the same as before, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, the options provided don't include equal ratios. Looking back, option E states the ratio as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16 birds, with each category having 3,9,1,3 respectively. That's inconsistent with our earlier analysis.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider the assumption that each F2 bird has equal chance of expressing each phenotype. Wait, but each bird's expression is dependent on their genotype. So, for example, a bird with C (pigment) and B (brown) will always express both traits, making it checkered red. Similarly, a bird with c (no pigment) and b (no body) will be plain brown. So, the actual counts would depend on how many birds meet each phenotype criteria.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of the four genotypes (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, etc.) corresponds to specific phenotypes. However, since the F2 is derived from the F1, which itself is derived from the parents, the exact counts depend on the segregation during gamete formation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the Punnett square properly. Let me list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBB: Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb: Plain Red\n3. ccBB: Checkered Brown\n4. ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nSince each F2 bird is equally likely to be any of the four genotypes, each phenotype occurs once in four birds. Thus, the expected ratio should be 25% for each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none seem to match this exactly. Perhaps I need to interpret the question differently. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each parent is Cc for pigment and Bb for body color, instead of being a homozygous checkered bird crossed with a plain brown bird. That could change things. Let me try that approach.\n\nParent 1: Cc \u00d7 Cc (pigment) \u2013 resulting in CC, Cc, cc (phenotypically: checkered, red, plain)\nParent 2: Bb \u00d7 Bb (body color) \u2013 resulting in Bb, BB (phenotypically: brown, red)\n\nThen, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be:\n\n```\n        | Cc    | Bb\n      ---------------\n Cc     | CCBB | CC Bb\n Bb     | CcBB | Bb Bb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is Cc for pigment and Parent 2 is Bb for body, then the F1 would be CcBb. So F2 would be Cc \u00d7 Cc (pigment) and Bb \u00d7 Bb (body), leading to a Punnett square of:\n\n```\n       | Cc    | Bb\n-------+-------+---\n Cc    | CC BB | CC Bb\n Bb    | Cc BB | Bb Bb\n```\n\nThe F2 genotypes are: 25% CC BB (checkered red), 25% CC Bb (checkered brown), 25% Cc BB (red brown), 25% Cc Bb (red brown), 25% Bb Bb (plain brown).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (25%)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (25%)\n- Cc BB: Red Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red Brown (25%)\n- Bb Bb: Plain Brown (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Red Brown: 50% (from Cc BB and Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut this contradicts the previous approach. I think the confusion arises from whether the parents are homozygous for both traits or just for one. Let me go back to the original problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So Parent 1 is CcBB (but wait, no\u2014the first part was a typo. Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits?), but wait, that can't be right because the checkered bird would be ccBB, and the plain brown would be CCbb. Wait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The bird's genotype is determined by the genes involved. The question mentions two genes: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). So the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would mean it has the recessive alleles for both traits. So, for pigment color (C is dominant, c recessive), it must be cc. For body color (B is dominant, b recessive), it must be bb. So the genotype would be ccbb. But wait, that can't be right because a bird with ccbb would have both recessive traits, i.e., plain body and no pigment. But the problem states it's a checkered red bird, implying that it has the dominant allele for pigment but not for body. Therefore, the genotype should be CcBB? Wait, no\u2014because for body color, if it's plain brown (bb), then the genotype should be CcBB. But that would mean the bird has the dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive body allele (b). So the genotype would be CcBB. But wait, that's impossible because C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So a bird with CcBB would have pigment red and body black, not plain brown. Therefore, I think there's a misunderstanding. The correct genotype for a checkered red bird would be CcBB, meaning the bird has the dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive body allele (B=b). Wait, no\u2014wait, no, in standard notation, B is the dominant body color, so a bird with B would express brown, and b would express plain. Therefore, a bird with Bb would be brown, and bb plain. So a checkered bird would have both B and b. But in terms of pigment color, it would have C (red) and c (plain). Therefore, the genotype for a checkered red bird would be CcBB (since C is dominant and B is present). Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird is checkered, which means it has the recessive allele for pigment (c) and the recessive allele for body (b). Therefore, its genotype would be ccbb. But in terms of the given genes, perhaps the question is mixing up the notation. Let me assume that the first parent is CC BB (with C and B dominant), which would make it fully dominant for both traits, hence red and brown. The second parent is cc bb (recessive for both traits), hence plain and checkered. Wait, but that would mean the first parent is red and brown, the second is plain and checkered. Then, their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the usual dihybrid ratios.\n\nWait, but the problem says the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. So for pigment color, it's recessive (c), and for body color, it's also recessive (b). Therefore, its genotype would be ccbb. But that can't be right because if a bird is ccbb, it would have both recessive traits, meaning it would be plain body and no pigment. However, the problem states it's a checkered red bird, implying it has pigment red and is checkered. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation. Let me try to adjust.\n\nPerhaps the notation uses uppercase letters for dominant traits and lowercase for recessives. So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). Therefore, a checkered red bird would have both recessive alleles: c (for pigment) and b (for body). So its genotype would be ccbb. Similarly, a plain brown bird would have B (dominant for body) and bb (recessive for pigment), so its genotype would be BBbb? Wait, no, because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So a plain brown bird would have B (dominant) for body and bb for pigment. Therefore, its genotype would be BBbb? Wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles per gene. So for body color (B/b), the bird is plain, so bb. For pigment color (C/c), it's red, so CC or Cc. Therefore, a plain brown bird would be Ccbb. But that can't be right because a bird with Ccbb would have C (red) and b (checkered), resulting in brown body and red pigment. Wait, but that bird would have brown body and red pigment, making it a red-brown bird. But the problem refers to it as plain brown, which would require both alleles to be recessive for pigment (i.e., cc) and dominant for body (B). So its genotype would be ccBB. Therefore, the first parent is ccBB (checkered red), and the second is Ccbb (plain brown). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the dihybrid cross ratios.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBB: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccBb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25% in the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nThis would result in a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes. However, the answer choices do not reflect this. Looking back, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds, but according to our analysis, each phenotype should have 25% occurrence. Therefore, none of the options seem correct. However, if we sum the squares of the phenotypic ratios, perhaps the user is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the dominance hierarchy differently, such as treating all recessive alleles as the same phenotype regardless of the gene. But that wouldn't fit the standard Mendelian rules.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is using a different method, like counting the number of each trait rather than the percentage. For example, each bird has two traits, and the user is counting the number of birds with each combination of traits. If that's the case, then in F2, the number of birds with each phenotype would be 1/4 of the total, which is 4 when the total is 16. But that still doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, if the bird has C and B, it'll have both traits. If it has C and b, it'll have pigment red and checkered. Similarly, c and B gives plain and brown, while c and b gives plain and checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But that's not possible because not all birds will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't correct. Instead, we should consider that for each bird, the combination of C and B determines the phenotype. Since C and B are separate genes, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both. So the actual probability is calculated based on the genetic makeup.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this using a Punnett square considering the F2 generation. Since the F2 comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, we can create the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb. It produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, actually, since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are only CB and cb. Because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes, each occurring at 50%.\n\nTherefore, when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square would then look like this:\n\n```\n        | CB    | cb\n      -----------------\n CB     | CcBB | Ccbb\n cb     | CcBB | c c bb\n```\n\nSo the F2 generation consists of four types of birds: CcBB (25%), Ccbb (25%), ccBB (25%), and ccbb (25%). Now, we need to determine the phenotypes of these birds based on the genes.\n\nLet's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: \n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n- Ccbb:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - Phenotype: Plain Red\n\n- ccBB:\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n- ccbb:\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n  - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four genotypes, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, since each bird can express multiple traits, we need to consider how many birds exhibit each phenotype.\n\nEach bird can have up to two traits. The phenotypic ratios are often expressed in terms of the combination of traits, but sometimes simplified into the number of each trait. However, in this case, each bird's phenotype is a combination of two traits. To simplify, we can categorize the phenotypes as follows:\n\n1. Both traits expressed: Checkered Red and Checkered Brown\n2. Pigment expressed but not body: Checkered Red and Plain\n3. Plain but expressed pigment: Plain Red and Checkered\n4. Neither expressed: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities accurately. Another way is to count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: Only the birds with C (pigment) and B (brown) alleles. In the F2, this is 25% of the population.\n- **Plain Red**: Birds with C (pigeon) but not B. This is 25%.\n- **Checkered Brown**: Birds without C (so cc) but with B. Also 25%.\n- **Plain Brown**: Without C (cc) and without B (bb). 25%.\n\nBut wait, that adds up to 100%, but in reality, some birds may have all three traits or none. However, given the dominance hierarchy, if an animal has C, it'll have pigment red, regardless of the B trait. Similarly, if it has B, it'll have brown. So the four phenotypes are accurate.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option E says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculation shows each phenotype should occur equally, not differing in numbers. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, that's unequal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation. Let me re-examine. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. The Punnett square should be:\n\n```\n        | CB     | cb\n      ---------------\n CB     | CcBB  | Ccbb\n cb     | CcBB  | ccBB\n```\n\nSo the F2 is 25% CcBB, 25% Ccbb, 25% ccBB, 25% ccbb. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered Red (both C and B dominant)\n- Ccbb: Plain Red (only C dominant, B recessive)\n- ccBB: Checkered Brown (only c, B dominant)\n- ccbb: Plain Brown (no C, no B)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each phenotype occurs once in every four birds. So the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect this. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the question is asking for the F2 generation after two generations of crossing F1 with F1, which results in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes two alleles for each gene. Let me try recalculating.\n\nIf each parent is heterozygous for both genes, say Parent A is CcBB and Parent B is ccbb, then the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. As before, the F2 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb. The phenotypes remain the same as before, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, the options provided don't include equal ratios. Looking back, option E states the ratio as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16 birds, with each category having 3,9,1,3 respectively. That's inconsistent with our earlier analysis.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider the assumption that each F2 bird has equal chance of expressing each phenotype. Wait, but each bird's expression is dependent on their genotype. So, for example, a bird with C (pigment) and B (brown) will always express both traits, making it checkered red. Similarly, a bird with c (no pigment) and b (no body) will be plain brown. So, the actual counts would depend on how many birds meet each phenotype criteria.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of the four genotypes (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, etc.) corresponds to specific phenotypes. However, since the F2 is derived from the F1, which itself is derived from the parents, the exact counts depend on the segregation during gamete formation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the Punnett square properly. Let me list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBB: Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb: Plain Red\n3. ccBB: Checkered Brown\n4. ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nSince each F2 bird is equally likely to be any of the four genotypes, each phenotype occurs once in four birds. Thus, the expected ratio should be 25% for each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none seem to match this exactly. Perhaps I need to interpret the question differently. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each parent is Cc for pigment and Bb for body color, instead of being a homozygous checkered bird crossed with a plain brown bird. That could change things. Let me try that approach.\n\nParent 1: Cc \u00d7 Cc (pigment) \u2013 resulting in CC, Cc, cc (phenotypically: checkered, red, plain)\nParent 2: Bb \u00d7 Bb (body color) \u2013 resulting in Bb, BB (phenotypically: brown, red)\n\nThen, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be:\n\n```\n        | Cc    | Bb\n      ---------------\n Cc     | CCBB | CC Bb\n Bb     | CcBB | Bb Bb\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is Cc for pigment and Parent 2 is Bb for body, then the F1 would be CcBb. So F2 would be Cc \u00d7 Cc (pigment) and Bb \u00d7 Bb (body), leading to a Punnett square of:\n\n```\n       | Cc    | Bb\n-------+-------+---\n Cc    | CC BB | CC Bb\n Bb    | Cc BB | Bb Bb\n```\n\nThe F2 genotypes are: 25% CC BB (checkered red), 25% CC Bb (checkered brown), 25% Cc BB (red brown), 25% Cc Bb (red brown), 25% Bb Bb (plain brown).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (25%)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (25%)\n- Cc BB: Red Brown (25%)\n- Cc Bb: Red Brown (25%)\n- Bb Bb: Plain Brown (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Red Brown: 50% (from Cc BB and Cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut this contradicts the previous approach. I think the confusion arises from whether the parents are homozygous for both traits or just for one. Let me go back to the original problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So Parent 1 is CcBB (but wait, no\u2014the first part was a typo. Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits?), but wait, that can't be right because the checkered bird would be ccBB, and the plain brown would be CCbb. Wait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The bird's genotype is determined by the genes involved. The question mentions two genes: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). So the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would mean it has the recessive alleles for both traits. So, for pigment color (C is dominant, c recessive), it must be cc. For body color (B is dominant, b recessive), it must be bb. So the genotype would be ccbb. But wait, that can't be right because a bird with ccbb would have both recessive traits, i.e., plain body and no pigment. But the problem states it's a checkered red bird, implying that it has the dominant allele for pigment but not for body. Therefore, the genotype should be CcBB? Wait, no\u2014because for body color, if it's plain brown (bb), then the genotype should be CcBB. But that would mean the bird has the dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive body allele (b). So the genotype would be CcBB. But wait, that's impossible because C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So a bird with CcBB would have pigment red and body black, not plain brown. Therefore, I think there's a misunderstanding. The correct genotype for a checkered red bird would be CcBB, meaning the bird has the dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive body allele (B=b). Wait, no\u2014wait, no, in standard notation, B is the dominant body color, so a bird with B would express brown, and b would express plain. Therefore, a bird with Bb would be brown, and bb plain. So a checkered bird would have both B and b. But in terms of pigment color, it would have C (red) and c (plain). Therefore, the genotype for a checkered red bird would be CcBB (since C is dominant and B is present). Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird is checkered, which means it has the recessive allele for pigment (c) and the recessive allele for body (b). Therefore, its genotype would be ccbb. But in terms of the given genes, perhaps the question is mixing up the notation. Let me assume that the first parent is CC BB (with C and B dominant), which would make it fully dominant for both traits, hence red and brown. The second parent is cc bb (recessive for both traits), hence plain and checkered. Wait, but that would mean the first parent is red and brown, the second is plain and checkered. Then, their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the usual dihybrid ratios.\n\nWait, but the problem says the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. So for pigment color, it's recessive (c), and for body color, it's also recessive (b). Therefore, its genotype would be ccbb. But that can't be right because if a bird is ccbb, it would have both recessive traits, meaning it would be plain body and no pigment. However, the problem states it's a checkered red bird, implying it has pigment red and is checkered. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation. Let me try to adjust.\n\nPerhaps the notation uses uppercase letters for dominant traits and lowercase for recessives. So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). Therefore, a checkered red bird would have both recessive alleles: c (for pigment) and b (for body). So its genotype would be ccbb. Similarly, a plain brown bird would have B (dominant for body) and bb (recessive for pigment), so its genotype would be BBbb? Wait, no, because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So a plain brown bird would have B (dominant) for body and bb for pigment. Therefore, its genotype would be BBbb? Wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles per gene. So for body color (B/b), the bird is plain, so bb. For pigment color (C/c), it's red, so CC or Cc. Therefore, a plain brown bird would be Ccbb. But that can't be right because a bird with Ccbb would have C (red) and b (checkered), resulting in brown body and red pigment. Wait, but that bird would have brown body and red pigment, making it a red-brown bird. But the problem refers to it as plain brown, which would require both alleles to be recessive for pigment (i.e., cc) and dominant for body (B). So its genotype would be ccBB. Therefore, the first parent is ccBB (checkered red), and the second is Ccbb (plain brown). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the dihybrid cross ratios.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBB: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccBb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25% in the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nThis would result in a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes. However, the answer choices do not reflect this. Looking back, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds, but according to our analysis, each phenotype should have 25% occurrence. Therefore, none of the options seem correct. However, if we sum the squares of the phenotypic ratios, perhaps the user is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the dominance hierarchy differently, such as treating all recessive alleles as the same phenotype regardless of the gene. But that wouldn't fit the standard Mendelian rules.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is using a different method, like counting the number of each trait rather than the percentage. For example, each bird has two traits, and the user is counting the number of birds with each combination of traits. If that's the case, then in F2, the number of birds with each phenotype would be 1/4 of the total, which is 4 when the total is 16. But that still doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, since each bird is expressed as a combination of both traits, the phenotypic ratios can vary based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, since each bird is expressed as a combination of both traits, the phenotypic ratios can vary based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nSo the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. To find the frequency of each phenotype, we calculate the product of the probabilities for each trait. Assuming that the genes assort independently and equally, the probabilities are:\n\nFor pigment color:\n- Probability of red (C present) = p_C = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of plain (c present) = p_c = 0 (but actually, it's the opposite\u2014p_c = 1/2 if the gene is at the same position, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.)\n\nWait, no. The actual probabilities depend on the parents' genotypes. Let me get back to the problem.\n\nThe parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both C and B are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (so both c and b are recessive)\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure (i.e., both heterozygotes), the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but that applies when both parents are heterozygotes (like Aa Bb). In our case, the parents are both homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), which simplifies things because the F1 will all be Cc Bb, and then the F2 will follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, in the given options, none directly match 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which totals 5+3+2+6=16, but that seems off. Option G is 12,2,2,2 totaling 18, which also doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about the F2 generation but about the phenotypic ratio within the F2 itself. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Hmm, but in a standard dihybrid cross starting from two homozygotes, the F2 will indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to fit exactly. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled from A to J, each giving different ratios. Let me list them again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 20\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nWait, none of the options except G, H, and others don't match 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, H, or others, but my initial thought was that the F2 ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nLet me recalculate the phenotypic ratios properly.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The traits are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent)\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c present) and brown (B present)\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c present) and checkered (B absent)\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we'll calculate the probabilities based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nGiven Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Both C and B are dominant, so all F1 will have C and B, leading to Phenotype 1.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n- Both c and b are recessive, so all F1 will have c and b, leading to Phenotype 4.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be Cc Bb, which results in Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) and Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered).\n\nNow, when F1 (Cc Bb) selfs to produce F2, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC \u2192 Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, corresponding to 25% each. However, looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 parts total, which is 9:3:3:1 but scaled differently\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Same issue\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Scaled differently\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal distribution\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 12 parts, which sums to 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous but instead one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question states: \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, \"homoez hybrid cross\"\u2014wait, maybe it's a typo, perhaps it meant dihybrid cross. So, the parents are:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Heterozygous plain brown: Cc bb\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Because otherwise, if both parents were homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. So I must have misinterpreted the parents. Let me proceed under the assumption that the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and Cc bb (heterozygous plain brown). This aligns with the options presented.\n\nSo, now, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the next generation after selfing F1. As before, F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 18\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nWait, none of these match 1:1:1:1. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me try another approach. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but rather one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous. Let's assume that one parent is CC BB (homozygous) and the other is Cc bb (heterozygous). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, the F2 would be derived from F1 selfing. This seems plausible because the options do include ratios that could come from such a cross.\n\nSo, proceeding with this assumption:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: Cc bb (heterozygous)\n\nF1: CC BB (selfed) \u2192 Cc Bb\nF2: Derived from F1 selfing, so the possible genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAgain, each phenotypic category is 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. Still not matching any options. Let's reconsider the parents.\n\nPerhaps the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: Cc Bb (heterozygous)\n\nThen, F1 would be Cc BB (since Cc * BB \u2192 Cc BB), and F2 would be derived from F1 selfing.\n\nBut that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and Cc Bb. But without clear information, it's challenging.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,2. Which adds up to 18. How did that happen? If the F2 genotypes had certain counts leading to those numbers, perhaps due to unequal segregation during meiosis. But under Mendelian inheritance, each genotype should occur at 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2, not the actual number of each phenotype, but the ratio of the total number of each phenotype across all individuals. Let me recount the possible outcomes.\n\nIf F2 consists of 16 animals (assuming each F1 selfing yields 4 x 4 = 16), then:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 4 (from CC)\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 4 (from Cc)\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 4 (from cc)\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 4 (from bb)\n\nTotal: 16, with each phenotype appearing 4 times. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which sums to 16. But none of the options show 4:4:4:4. However, option F says 4,4,4,4, which does match this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 phenotypes, but the question specifically asks for F2. So, if the F2 is 16 animals, each with 4 of each phenotype, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, going back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me use a Punnett square approach. The F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would be derived from crossing F1 with F1. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n       | Cc | Cc |\n     -----------------\n     | Cc | Cc | \n     -----------------\n     | Cc | Cc | \n\nWait, no, the correct way is to consider all combinations. Let's construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb (Wait, actually, each F1 bird is Cc Bb, so gametes would be CB, cb, cb, cb? No, wait, a dihybrid cross where both parents are Cc Bb would produce a F2 with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, confusion arises because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All C and B alleles are dominant.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All c and b alleles are recessive.\n\nSo F1: Cc Bb (all C and B dominant, c and b recessive).\nF2: Result of F1 selfing.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (C from F1 and C from F1)\n- Cc (C from F1 and c from F1)\n- cc (c from F1 and c from F1)\n- bb (b from F1 and b from F1)\n\nAs before, each with 25% chance.\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended different parents.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and Cc bb, making the F1 Cc Bb, and then the F2 would have a different ratio. Let me try that.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB\n- Parent 2: Cc bb\n\nF1: CC BB (from CC * CC) \u2192 Cc BB (from CC * Cc)? Wait, no. Let me compute the F1 properly.\n\nF1 Genotype:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 can only contribute C (dominant) for C and B (dominant). Parent 2 can contribute C (dominant) or c (recessive) for C, and B (dominant) or b (recessive) for B.\n\nTherefore, F1 genotypes:\n\n- From Parent 1: C (for both alleles) and B (for both alleles)\n- From Parent 2: C (for C) and b (for B)\nSo F1 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent 1 and Parent 2: CC BB (only possibility, since both parents provide dominant alleles)\n- Additionally, from Parent 1 and Parent 2: CC Bb (if Parent 2 provides C and B, but wait, Parent 1 only provides C and B, so F1 cannot get B from Parent 2 unless Parent 2 can pass B, but Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only pass c or b. Therefore, F1 genotypes are CC BB and CC bb? Wait, no:\n\nWait, Parent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nWhen F1 is produced, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C locus: Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 can provide C or c. For the B locus: Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 can provide B or b.\n\nTherefore, possible F1 genotypes:\n\n- C (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 1) \u2192 CB\n- C (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cb\n- c (from Parent 2) and B (from Parent 1) \u2192 cB\n- c (from Parent 2) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 cb\n\nSo F1 genotypes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each with 25% probability.\n\nNow, F2 is formed by F1 selfing. Each F1 bird can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- CB \u2192 can produce CB and cb\n- Cb \u2192 can produce CB and cb\n- cB \u2192 can produce cB and cb\n- cb \u2192 can produce cb and cb\n\nTherefore, the F2 population will have the following genotype combinations:\n\nFrom CB gametes:\n- CB * CB \u2192 CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * Cb \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * cb \u2192 Cc (C) and bB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * cb \u2192 Cc (C) and bB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n\nSimilarly, from Cb gametes:\n- Cb * CB \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cb * Cb \u2192 cc (c) and bb (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nFrom cB gametes:\n- cB * CB \u2192 cc (c) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cB * Cb \u2192 cc (c)",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, since each bird is expressed as a combination of both traits, the phenotypic ratios can vary based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nSo the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. To find the frequency of each phenotype, we calculate the product of the probabilities for each trait. Assuming that the genes assort independently and equally, the probabilities are:\n\nFor pigment color:\n- Probability of red (C present) = p_C = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of plain (c present) = p_c = 0 (but actually, it's the opposite\u2014p_c = 1/2 if the gene is at the same position, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.)\n\nWait, no. The actual probabilities depend on the parents' genotypes. Let me get back to the problem.\n\nThe parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both C and B are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (so both c and b are recessive)\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure (i.e., both heterozygotes), the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but that applies when both parents are heterozygotes (like Aa Bb). In our case, the parents are both homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), which simplifies things because the F1 will all be Cc Bb, and then the F2 will follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, in the given options, none directly match 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which totals 5+3+2+6=16, but that seems off. Option G is 12,2,2,2 totaling 18, which also doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about the F2 generation but about the phenotypic ratio within the F2 itself. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Hmm, but in a standard dihybrid cross starting from two homozygotes, the F2 will indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to fit exactly. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled from A to J, each giving different ratios. Let me list them again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 20\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nWait, none of the options except G, H, and others don't match 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, H, or others, but my initial thought was that the F2 ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nLet me recalculate the phenotypic ratios properly.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The traits are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C present) and checkered (B absent)\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c present) and brown (B present)\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c present) and checkered (B absent)\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we'll calculate the probabilities based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nGiven Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Both C and B are dominant, so all F1 will have C and B, leading to Phenotype 1.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n- Both c and b are recessive, so all F1 will have c and b, leading to Phenotype 4.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be Cc Bb, which results in Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) and Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered).\n\nNow, when F1 (Cc Bb) selfs to produce F2, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC \u2192 Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 4: bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, corresponding to 25% each. However, looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 parts total, which is 9:3:3:1 but scaled differently\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Same issue\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Scaled differently\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal distribution\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 12 parts, which sums to 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous but instead one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question states: \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, \"homoez hybrid cross\"\u2014wait, maybe it's a typo, perhaps it meant dihybrid cross. So, the parents are:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Heterozygous plain brown: Cc bb\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Because otherwise, if both parents were homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. So I must have misinterpreted the parents. Let me proceed under the assumption that the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and Cc bb (heterozygous plain brown). This aligns with the options presented.\n\nSo, now, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the next generation after selfing F1. As before, F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this exact ratio. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 18\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nWait, none of these match 1:1:1:1. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me try another approach. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but rather one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous. Let's assume that one parent is CC BB (homozygous) and the other is Cc bb (heterozygous). Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, the F2 would be derived from F1 selfing. This seems plausible because the options do include ratios that could come from such a cross.\n\nSo, proceeding with this assumption:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: Cc bb (heterozygous)\n\nF1: CC BB (selfed) \u2192 Cc Bb\nF2: Derived from F1 selfing, so the possible genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAgain, each phenotypic category is 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. Still not matching any options. Let's reconsider the parents.\n\nPerhaps the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: Cc Bb (heterozygous)\n\nThen, F1 would be Cc BB (since Cc * BB \u2192 Cc BB), and F2 would be derived from F1 selfing.\n\nBut that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and Cc Bb. But without clear information, it's challenging.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,2. Which adds up to 18. How did that happen? If the F2 genotypes had certain counts leading to those numbers, perhaps due to unequal segregation during meiosis. But under Mendelian inheritance, each genotype should occur at 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2, not the actual number of each phenotype, but the ratio of the total number of each phenotype across all individuals. Let me recount the possible outcomes.\n\nIf F2 consists of 16 animals (assuming each F1 selfing yields 4 x 4 = 16), then:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 4 (from CC)\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 4 (from Cc)\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 4 (from cc)\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 4 (from bb)\n\nTotal: 16, with each phenotype appearing 4 times. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which sums to 16. But none of the options show 4:4:4:4. However, option F says 4,4,4,4, which does match this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 phenotypes, but the question specifically asks for F2. So, if the F2 is 16 animals, each with 4 of each phenotype, the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, going back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me use a Punnett square approach. The F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would be derived from crossing F1 with F1. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n       | Cc | Cc |\n     -----------------\n     | Cc | Cc | \n     -----------------\n     | Cc | Cc | \n\nWait, no, the correct way is to consider all combinations. Let's construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb (Wait, actually, each F1 bird is Cc Bb, so gametes would be CB, cb, cb, cb? No, wait, a dihybrid cross where both parents are Cc Bb would produce a F2 with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, confusion arises because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All C and B alleles are dominant.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All c and b alleles are recessive.\n\nSo F1: Cc Bb (all C and B dominant, c and b recessive).\nF2: Result of F1 selfing.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (C from F1 and C from F1)\n- Cc (C from F1 and c from F1)\n- cc (c from F1 and c from F1)\n- bb (b from F1 and b from F1)\n\nAs before, each with 25% chance.\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended different parents.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and Cc bb, making the F1 Cc Bb, and then the F2 would have a different ratio. Let me try that.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB\n- Parent 2: Cc bb\n\nF1: CC BB (from CC * CC) \u2192 Cc BB (from CC * Cc)? Wait, no. Let me compute the F1 properly.\n\nF1 Genotype:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 can only contribute C (dominant) for C and B (dominant). Parent 2 can contribute C (dominant) or c (recessive) for C, and B (dominant) or b (recessive) for B.\n\nTherefore, F1 genotypes:\n\n- From Parent 1: C (for both alleles) and B (for both alleles)\n- From Parent 2: C (for C) and b (for B)\nSo F1 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent 1 and Parent 2: CC BB (only possibility, since both parents provide dominant alleles)\n- Additionally, from Parent 1 and Parent 2: CC Bb (if Parent 2 provides C and B, but wait, Parent 1 only provides C and B, so F1 cannot get B from Parent 2 unless Parent 2 can pass B, but Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only pass c or b. Therefore, F1 genotypes are CC BB and CC bb? Wait, no:\n\nWait, Parent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nWhen F1 is produced, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C locus: Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 can provide C or c. For the B locus: Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 can provide B or b.\n\nTherefore, possible F1 genotypes:\n\n- C (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 1) \u2192 CB\n- C (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cb\n- c (from Parent 2) and B (from Parent 1) \u2192 cB\n- c (from Parent 2) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 cb\n\nSo F1 genotypes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each with 25% probability.\n\nNow, F2 is formed by F1 selfing. Each F1 bird can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- CB \u2192 can produce CB and cb\n- Cb \u2192 can produce CB and cb\n- cB \u2192 can produce cB and cb\n- cb \u2192 can produce cb and cb\n\nTherefore, the F2 population will have the following genotype combinations:\n\nFrom CB gametes:\n- CB * CB \u2192 CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * Cb \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * cb \u2192 Cc (C) and bB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n- CB * cb \u2192 Cc (C) and bB (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Brown)\n\nSimilarly, from Cb gametes:\n- Cb * CB \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Cb * Cb \u2192 cc (c) and bb (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nFrom cB gametes:\n- cB * CB \u2192 cc (c) and Bb (B) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n- cB * Cb \u2192 cc (c)",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, it'll have none. But in this problem, the options suggest that all phenotypes are possible. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the parents are producing gametes that combine to create F2, and the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. Let me approach this differently. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (all C and all B)\n- CC Bb (C and b)\n- cc BB (c and B)\n- cc Bb (c and b)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant. Pigment color: C is dominant over c, so any C results in red. Body color: B is dominant over b, so any B results in brown. Therefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: All C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown (both traits expressed)\nPhenotype 2: All C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (only body color)\nPhenotype 3: All c and B \u2192 Plain and brown (only pigment color)\nPhenotype 4: All c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered (no traits)\n\nSo now, the task is to determine how many birds in the F2 generation fall into each of these four phenotypes. To do this, we consider the number of ways each combination can occur based on Mendel's laws of inheritance.\n\nFor each gene, the F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive, but since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio will be different. However, in reality, since each gene operates independently, the overall ratio will still be multiplicative. \n\nLet me think in terms of segregation. For each gene, the F2 will have 3/4 chance of being dominant and 1/4 chance of being recessive. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. \n\nThe four possible phenotypes correspond to the following combinations of the two genes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Phenotype 1\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Phenotype 2\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Phenotype 3\n4. Both recessive (c and b): Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use the Punnett square approach. The F2 generation consists of 16 birds (4x4 grid). The distribution of each phenotype is determined by the number of birds that carry each genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene behaves independently, we can compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment Red (C):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4 (since 3/4 of F2 have at least one C, either dominant or recessive)\n- Similarly, for Body Color (B):\n  - Probability of B: 3/4\n  - Probability of b: 1/4\n\nSince these are independent events, the joint probabilities are the products:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both c and b: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, which confirms the calculation. However, looking at the answer choices, they seem to present the phenotypic ratios as counts rather than fractions. So converting the fractions to counts out of 16:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But checking the answer choices, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our calculation. Wait, no\u2014the order might differ, but the ratios are 1:3:3:9. Wait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, typically starting with the most frequent phenotype. In our case, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) is 9, then Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered) is 3, Phenotype 3 (Checkered and Brown) is 3, and Phenotype 4 (Checkered and Checkered) is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option D states the same ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems inverted. Let me double-check the phenotypes and their corresponding ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown (C and B) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered (C and b) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (c and B) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the order from most to least common is:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (9)\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (3)\n3. Plain and Brown (3)\n4. Plain and Checkered (1)\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option D presents them as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, but without the numbers. So according to the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer choices directly match this except option D, which lists 1:3:3:9, but that would imply checkered red is 1, which contradicts our count. Wait, no\u2014I must have misinterpreted the question regarding the phenotypes. Perhaps the question uses \"plain\" instead of \"checkered.\" Let me re-examine the given information.\n\nThe original problem statement mentions:\n\n- Checkered = cc\n- Plain = checkered?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem defines:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (cc)\n- Plain is dominant (CC)\n\nAnd similarly for color:\n\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nWait, no\u2014the original problem defines:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (cc)\n- Plain is dominant (CC)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous understanding. Because if checkered is recessive (cc) and plain is dominant (CC), that would mean that individuals with at least one dominant allele are considered 'plain,' while those with both recessive alleles are 'checkered.' But in standard genetics, usually, the recessive allele is what results in the trait not displaying. So perhaps the problem is defining checkered as the recessive allele for both traits, i.e., both genes are recessive, resulting in checkered appearance. That complicates things because the phenotypes would then be based on the combination of both genes' effects.\n\nGiven that, let's redefine the phenotypes based on the definitions:\n\n- Checkered = both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 phenotype is checkered\n- Plain = at least one dominant allele (either C/B or c/b) \u2192 phenotype is plain\n\nThis changes the way we interpret the phenotypes. So now, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown (both traits expressed)\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (only brown)\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown (only pigment)\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered (no traits)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, and the phenotypes will depend on how many of these 16 birds fit into each category.\n\nUsing Mendel's laws, each gene segregates independently. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B: (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. c and b: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1 to 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, none of them present this exact ratio, but let's see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems to invert the order, placing the most common phenotype last, which isn't consistent with our current understanding. Our calculations show that Phenotype 1 (Pigment Red and Brown) is the most common with 9, followed by Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered) with 3, then Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown) with 3, and finally Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered) with 1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This seems to place the most common phenotype first, but according to our calculation, it's Phenotype 1 (9), then Phenotype 2 (3), etc. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which also doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation perfectly. But looking back, the answer options labeled from A to J don't include an option with 9:3:3:1. Wait, let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nWait, none of these options exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is incorrect as the total should be 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which does sum to 16. However, the answer options don't list an option with 9:3:3:1, but option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the definitions. Let me re-express the phenotypes correctly. According to the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (cc)\n- Plain is dominant (CC)\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nSo, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, and the phenotypes will depend on how many fit into each category. Using the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. c and b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer options, none of them present this exactly. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to the correct ratios, but the answer options are labeled from A to J, and option C is indeed present as option C: 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which reverses the order, making it incorrect. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but incorrectly assigns higher counts to earlier phenotypes. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is equally distributed. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which is incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the required ratios. Option I is 7,5,1,3, which sums to 16 but also doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. However, looking back, I realize that the initial assumption was incorrect regarding the phenotypes. Earlier, I thought the definition was checkered when both genes were recessive, but according to the problem statement, checkered is recessive (cc) and plain is dominant (CC). Similarly, brown is dominant (B) and checkered is recessive (b). Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWhich aligns with the previous analysis leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options present this exact ratio. But upon reviewing the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which is exactly the ratio we derived. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, it'll have none. But in this problem, the options suggest that all phenotypes are possible. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the parents are producing gametes that combine to create F2, and the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. Let me approach this differently. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (all C and all B)\n- CC Bb (C and b)\n- cc BB (c and B)\n- cc Bb (c and b)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant. Pigment color: C is dominant over c, so any C results in red. Body color: B is dominant over b, so any B results in brown. Therefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: All C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown (both traits expressed)\nPhenotype 2: All C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (only body color)\nPhenotype 3: All c and B \u2192 Plain and brown (only pigment color)\nPhenotype 4: All c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered (no traits)\n\nSo now, the task is to determine how many birds in the F2 generation fall into each of these four phenotypes. To do this, we consider the number of ways each combination can occur based on Mendel's laws of inheritance.\n\nFor each gene, the F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive, but since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio will be different. However, in reality, since each gene operates independently, the overall ratio will still be multiplicative. \n\nLet me think in terms of segregation. For each gene, the F2 will have 3/4 chance of being dominant and 1/4 chance of being recessive. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. \n\nThe four possible phenotypes correspond to the following combinations of the two genes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Phenotype 1\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Phenotype 2\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Phenotype 3\n4. Both recessive (c and b): Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use the Punnett square approach. The F2 generation consists of 16 birds (4x4 grid). The distribution of each phenotype is determined by the number of birds that carry each genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene behaves independently, we can compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment Red (C):\n\n- Probability of C: 3/4 (since 3/4 of F2 have at least one C, either dominant or recessive)\n- Similarly, for Body Color (B):\n  - Probability of B: 3/4\n  - Probability of b: 1/4\n\nSince these are independent events, the joint probabilities are the products:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Both c and b: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, which confirms the calculation. However, looking at the answer choices, they seem to present the phenotypic ratios as counts rather than fractions. So converting the fractions to counts out of 16:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But checking the answer choices, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our calculation. Wait, no\u2014the order might differ, but the ratios are 1:3:3:9. Wait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, typically starting with the most frequent phenotype. In our case, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) is 9, then Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered) is 3, Phenotype 3 (Checkered and Brown) is 3, and Phenotype 4 (Checkered and Checkered) is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option D states the same ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems inverted. Let me double-check the phenotypes and their corresponding ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown (C and B) \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered (C and b) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (c and B) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the order from most to least common is:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (9)\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (3)\n3. Plain and Brown (3)\n4. Plain and Checkered (1)\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, option D presents them as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, but without the numbers.

The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B: (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. c and b: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1 to 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, none of them present this exact ratio, but let's see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems to invert the order, placing the most common phenotype last, which isn't consistent with our current understanding. Our calculations show that Phenotype 1 (Pigment Red and Brown) is the most common with 9, followed by Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered) with 3, then Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown) with 3, and finally Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered) with 1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This seems to place the most common phenotype first, but according to our calculation, it's Phenotype 1 (9), then Phenotype 2 (3), etc. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which also doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation perfectly. But looking back, the answer options labeled from A to J don't include an option with 9:3:3:1. Wait, let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nWait, none of these options exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is incorrect as the total should be 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which does sum to 16. However, the answer options don't list an option with 9:3:3:1, but option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the definitions. Let me re-express the phenotypes correctly. According to the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered is recessive (cc)\n- Plain is dominant (CC)\n- Brown is dominant (B)\n- Checkered is recessive (b)\n\nSo, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, and the phenotypes will depend on how many fit into each category. Using the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C and b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. c and B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. c and b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer options, none of them present this exactly. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to the correct ratios, but the answer options are labeled from A to J, and option C is indeed present as option C: 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which reverses the order, making it incorrect. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which doesn't match. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but incorrectly assigns higher counts to earlier phenotypes. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is equally distributed. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which is incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the required ratios. Option I is 7,5,1,3, which sums to 16 but also doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. However, looking back, I realize that the initial assumption was incorrect regarding the phenotypes. Earlier, I thought the definition was checkered when both genes were recessive, but according to the problem statement, checkered is recessive (cc) and plain is dominant (CC). Similarly, brown is dominant (B) and checkered is recessive (b). Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWhich aligns with the previous analysis leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options present this exact ratio. But upon reviewing the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which is exactly the ratio we derived. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant (which isn't possible here because the parents are homozygous and heterozygous), then it won't have either. But in this case, the F2 will always have both traits expressed unless... Wait, no, because each gene's expression is independent. So let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown (but actually, the bird could be brown if it has B, but since both are dominant, it's brown and red)\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: For pigment color (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (i.e., C_), it expresses red.\n- If it has c_, it expresses plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B (i.e., B_), it expresses brown.\n- If it has b_, it expresses checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_)\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_)\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, what's the probability of each gene being present?\n\nGene C:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Always C_ (100%)\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Always c_ (100%)\n\nSo, the probability of having pigment red (C_) is 1 (from CC) + 0 (from cc) = 1. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c_) is 1.\n\nGene B:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Always B_ (100%)\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Always b_ (100%)\n\nSo, the probability of having brown (B_) is 1, and the probability of having checkered (b_) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n3. Plain and brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n4. Plain and checkered: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n\nWait, that can't be right because it implies that all F2 birds have both traits, but that contradicts the idea of dominance. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it'll have both traits. If it has a dominant allele in one gene but not the other, it'll have one trait. If it has recessive alleles in both, it'll have none\u2014or perhaps it's considered non-bird-like.\n\nWait, in reality, if a bird has both dominant alleles, it'll display both traits. So, in this case, every bird in the F2 generation would have both traits because all parents are homozygous for each gene. Therefore, all F2 birds would have both traits expressed, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking back at the options, none of them seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is A, which says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But according to my calculation, all F2 would have both traits, leading to four phenotypes with equal counts. But this seems off because the question mentions checking for dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that only one dominant allele per gene contributes to the trait. Let's try that approach.\n\nAssuming that for pigment color, C is dominant and c is recessive, and similarly for body color, B is dominant and b is recessive. Then, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting the number of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nLet's consider each trait separately:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\n\nNow, the F2 generation is the result of a dihybrid cross between two parents: CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 generation would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. But wait, no\u2014if you cross CC BB (homozygous) with cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 would be Cc (from CC and cc) and BB (from BB and bb). So the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, now I'm confusing myself. Let's take it step by step.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nCrossing them: F1 will receive one allele from each parent.\n\nFrom Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only pass CB (since both alleles are dominant)\nFrom Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only pass cb (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nThus, F1 will be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB). But if Parent 2 can only pass cb, then F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) and also cb (from cc) and bb (from bb). This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use Punnett squares.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so C and B are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (so c and b are recessive)\n\nWhen crossing, the F1 would have the following gametes:\n\nFrom Parent 1: CB\nFrom Parent 2: cb\n\nSo F1 will be Cc (from CB) \u00d7 cb (from cb), but wait, actually, the F1 is the combination of all possible gametes. So the F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and CB (from CB), and then other combinations. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is the result of crossing CC BB (parent 1) with cc bb (parent 2). Each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\nGene C:\nParent 1: CC \u2192 can only pass C\nParent 2: cc \u2192 can only pass c\nSo F1: Cc\n\nGene B:\nParent 1: BB \u2192 can only pass B\nParent 2: bb \u2192 can only pass b\nSo F1: Bb\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) to get F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be calculated by considering each gene separately due to independent assortment.\n\nFor Gene C:\nParent: Cc \u00d7 Cc\nPossible gametes: 50% C, 50% c\nSo F2: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor Gene B:\nParent: Bb \u00d7 Bb\nPossible gametes: 50% B, 50% b\nSo F2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 phenotypes are determined by all possible combinations of CC/BB, CC/bb, cc/BB, cc/bb.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotypic category:\n\n1. CC and BB \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc and BB \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc and Bb \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 BB (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 Bb (50%) = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 BB (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 Bb (50%) = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%\n\nWait, but this is less than 100%, so something must be wrong. Oh, because each gene has three possible outcomes (dominant or recessive), and since the genes are independent, the actual phenotypic ratio should account for all combinations. But wait, each bird can only have two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should sum to 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal percentages:\n\n- 6.25%\n- 12.5%\n- 6.25%\n- 12.5%\nSum: 37.5% \u00d7 2 = 75%? No, wait, 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%.\n\nHmm, this indicates a miscalculation. Perhaps the issue arises because each bird can only have two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should reflect how many of the 16 possible genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities: dominant (C or B) or recessive (c or b). Since the genes are independent, there are 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. But in this case, each bird can only express two traits. Let me count how many combinations lead to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Requires at least one dominant allele in both genes. So, the genotypes that satisfy this are:\n\n- CC/B_: C_ (at least one C) and B_ (at least one B)\n- Which includes all combinations except cc/bb.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C_ and bb.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 cc and B_.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 cc and bb.\n\nNow, let's count the number of genotypic combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGenotypic Combinations leading to each Phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\nOut of 16 possible (assuming dihybrid cross), the number is 16 - (number of cc and bb). Wait, no\u2014using the rules:\n\nNumber of each type:\n\n- CC (25%): 4/16\n- Cc (50%): 8/16\n- cc (25%): 4/16\n- BB (25%): 4/16\n- Bb (50%): 8/16\n- bb (25%): 4/16\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_): All except cc and bb \u2192 12/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and bb): Includes all C_ and bb \u2192 12/16 (because C_ is 12/16 and bb is 4/16; but wait, no\u2014phenotype 2 is C_ and bb, which includes CC, Cc, and Bb. Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 12/16\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 4/16 (only those with C_ and bb)\n- Phenotype 3: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 4/16 (only those with cc and B_)\n- Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 1/16 (only cc and bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 12 : 4 : 4 : 1 \u2192 12:4:4:1.\n\nThis simplifies to 3:1:1:0.25, but in terms of whole numbers, it's 12:4:4:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match 12:4:4:1. Let me see:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nWait, no, that's different. Option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nNo, that's different too. Option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThat sums to 16, which matches our 12+4+4+1=21, which is over 16. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, adding up: 1+3+9+3=16, which fits. How does this come about?\n\nIf the ratio is 1:3:9:3, that's a standard Mendelian ratio for two linked genes where one is dominant and the other is recessive, showing incomplete dominance. So, if the order of dominance is such that one gene affects one trait and the other gene affects the other trait, and the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio would follow 1:3:9:3.\n\nIn this case, if the genes are ordered such that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, then:\n\n- checkered red (cc BB) \u2192 1\n- checkered brown (cc Bb) \u2192 3\n- plain red (cc bb) \u2192 9\n- plain brown (C_ bb) \u2192 3\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when C is present, it causes red, and when B is present, it causes brown. So the phenotypes would follow 1:3:9:3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 16, matching our previous count.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the ratio was 12:4:4:1, which is 16 as well. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's recount using the 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- The checkered phenotype (cc) is the recessive for both traits, contributing 1 part.\n- Checkered brown (cc Bb) is recessive for pigment (C), dominant for body (B) \u2192 3 parts.\n- Plain red (cc bb) is dominant for both \u2192 9 parts.\n- Plain brown (C_ bb) is dominant for one trait and recessive for the other \u2192 3 parts.\n\nTotal: 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, corresponding to option E.\n\nHowever, earlier when I considered the independent assortment, I ended up with a ratio of 12:4:4:1, which seems inconsistent with the 1:3:9:3 ratio. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, because in reality, when considering linked genes, the ratio follows the 1:3:9:3 pattern, not the independent assortment ratio. Independent assortment applies to genes that do not influence each other, while linked genes follow the 1:3:9:3 pattern because the genes are inherited together.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), and plain brown (3).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis aligns with the 1:3:9:3 ratio, but inverted. Because in the 1:3:9:3 pattern, the order is checkered red (cc) first, followed by checkered brown (cc Bb), then plain red (cc bb), and finally plain brown (C_ bb). So option E has the same sequence but with higher numbers for the latter two, which is correct.\n\nWait, but hold on: checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 3. Yes, that's exactly the 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other is recessive, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant (which isn't possible here because the parents are homozygous and heterozygous), then it won't have either. But in this case, the F2 will always have both traits expressed unless... Wait, no, because each gene's expression is independent. So let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown (but actually, the bird could be brown if it has B, but since both are dominant, it's brown and red)\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: For pigment color (C):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (i.e., C_), it expresses red.\n- If it has c_, it expresses plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B (i.e., B_), it expresses brown.\n- If it has b_, it expresses checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_)\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_)\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, what's the probability of each gene being present?\n\nGene C:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Always C_ (100%)\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Always c_ (100%)\n\nSo, the probability of having pigment red (C_) is 1 (from CC) + 0 (from cc) = 1. Similarly, the probability of having plain (c_) is 1.\n\nGene B:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Always B_ (100%)\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Always b_ (100%)\n\nSo, the probability of having brown (B_) is 1, and the probability of having checkered (b_) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n3. Plain and brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n4. Plain and checkered: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All individuals will have this phenotype.\n\nWait, that can't be right because it implies that all F2 birds have both traits, but that contradicts the idea of dominance. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it'll have both traits. If it has a dominant allele in one gene but not the other, it'll have one trait. If it has recessive alleles in both, it'll have none\u2014or perhaps it's considered non-bird-like.\n\nWait, in reality, if a bird has both dominant alleles, it'll display both traits. So, in this case, every bird in the F2 generation would have both traits because all parents are homozygous for each gene. Therefore, all F2 birds would have both traits expressed, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking back at the options, none of them seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is A, which says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But according to my calculation, all F2 would have both traits, leading to four phenotypes with equal counts. But this seems off because the question mentions checking for dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that only one dominant allele per gene contributes to the trait. Let's try that approach.\n\nAssuming that for pigment color, C is dominant and c is recessive, and similarly for body color, B is dominant and b is recessive. Then, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting the number of dominant and recessive alleles for each trait.\n\nLet's consider each trait separately:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\n\nNow, the F2 generation is the result of a dihybrid cross between two parents: CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 generation would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. But wait, no\u2014if you cross CC BB (homozygous) with cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 would be Cc (from CC and cc) and BB (from BB and bb). So the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, now I'm confusing myself. Let's take it step by step.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nCrossing them: F1 will receive one allele from each parent.\n\nFrom Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only pass CB (since both alleles are dominant)\nFrom Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only pass cb (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nThus, F1 will be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB). But if Parent 2 can only pass cb, then F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) and also cb (from cc) and bb (from bb). This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use Punnett squares.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so C and B are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (so c and b are recessive)\n\nWhen crossing, the F1 would have the following gametes:\n\nFrom Parent 1: CB\nFrom Parent 2: cb\n\nSo F1 will be Cc (from CB) \u00d7 cb (from cb), but wait, actually, the F1 is the combination of all possible gametes. So the F1 would be Cc (from Cc) and CB (from CB), and then other combinations. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is the result of crossing CC BB (parent 1) with cc bb (parent 2). Each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\nGene C:\nParent 1: CC \u2192 can only pass C\nParent 2: cc \u2192 can only pass c\nSo F1: Cc\n\nGene B:\nParent 1: BB \u2192 can only pass B\nParent 2: bb \u2192 can only pass b\nSo F1: Bb\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) to get F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be calculated by considering each gene separately due to independent assortment.\n\nFor Gene C:\nParent: Cc \u00d7 Cc\nPossible gametes: 50% C, 50% c\nSo F2: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor Gene B:\nParent: Bb \u00d7 Bb\nPossible gametes: 50% B, 50% b\nSo F2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 phenotypes are determined by all possible combinations of CC/BB, CC/bb, cc/BB, cc/bb.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotypic category:\n\n1. CC and BB \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC and Bb \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc and BB \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc and Bb \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 BB (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC (25%) \u00d7 Bb (50%) = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 BB (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc (25%) \u00d7 Bb (50%) = 12.5% \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%\n\nWait, but this is less than 100%, so something must be wrong. Oh, because each gene has three possible outcomes (dominant or recessive), and since the genes are independent, the actual phenotypic ratio should account for all combinations. But wait, each bird can only have two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should sum to 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal percentages:\n\n- 6.25%\n- 12.5%\n- 6.25%\n- 12.5%\nSum: 37.5% \u00d7 2 = 75%? No, wait, 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%.\n\nHmm, this indicates a miscalculation. Perhaps the issue arises because each bird can only have two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should reflect how many of the 16 possible genotypic combinations correspond to each phenotype. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities: dominant (C or B) or recessive (c or b). Since the genes are independent, there are 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 possible phenotypic combinations. But in this case, each bird can only express two traits. Let me count how many combinations lead to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Requires at least one dominant allele in both genes. So, the genotypes that satisfy this are:\n\n- CC/B_: C_ (at least one C) and B_ (at least one B)\n- Which includes all combinations except cc/bb.\n\nSimilarly, Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C_ and bb.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 cc and B_.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 cc and bb.\n\nNow, let's count the number of genotypic combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGenotypic Combinations leading to each Phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\nOut of 16 possible (assuming dihybrid cross), the number is 16 - (number of cc and bb). Wait, no\u2014using the rules:\n\nNumber of each type:\n\n- CC (25%): 4/16\n- Cc (50%): 8/16\n- cc (25%): 4/16\n- BB (25%): 4/16\n- Bb (50%): 8/16\n- bb (25%): 4/16\n\nNow, phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_): All except cc and bb \u2192 12/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and bb): Includes all C_ and bb \u2192 12/16 (because C_ is 12/16 and bb is 4/16; but wait, no\u2014phenotype 2 is C_ and bb, which includes CC, Cc, and Bb. Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 12/16\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 4/16 (only those with C_ and bb)\n- Phenotype 3: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 4/16 (only those with cc and B_)\n- Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 1/16 (only cc and bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 12 : 4 : 4 : 1 \u2192 12:4:4:1.\n\nThis simplifies to 3:1:1:0.25, but in terms of whole numbers, it's 12:4:4:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match 12:4:4:1. Let me see:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nWait, no, that's different. Option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nNo, that's different too. Option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThat sums to 16, which matches our 12+4+4+1=21, which is over 16. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, adding up: 1+3+9+3=16, which fits. How does this come about?\n\nIf the ratio is 1:3:9:3, that's a standard Mendelian ratio for two linked genes where one is dominant and the other is recessive, showing incomplete dominance. So, if the order of dominance is such that one gene affects one trait and the other gene affects the other trait, and the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio would follow 1:3:9:3.\n\nIn this case, if the genes are ordered such that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, then:\n\n- checkered red (cc BB) \u2192 1\n- checkered brown (cc Bb) \u2192 3\n- plain red (cc bb) \u2192 9\n- plain brown (C_ bb) \u2192 3\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when C is present, it causes red, and when B is present, it causes brown. So the phenotypes would follow 1:3:9:3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This adds up to 16, matching our previous count.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the ratio was 12:4:4:1, which is 16 as well. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's recount using the 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- The checkered phenotype (cc) is the recessive for both traits, contributing 1 part.\n- Checkered brown (cc Bb) is recessive for pigment (C), dominant for body (B) \u2192 3 parts.\n- Plain red (cc bb) is dominant for both \u2192 9 parts.\n- Plain brown (C_ bb) is dominant for one trait and recessive for the other \u2192 3 parts.\n\nTotal: 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, corresponding to option E.\n\nHowever, earlier when I considered the independent assortment, I ended up with a ratio of 12:4:4:1, which seems inconsistent with the 1:3:9:3 ratio. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, because in reality, when considering linked genes, the ratio follows the 1:3:9:3 pattern, not the independent assortment ratio. Independent assortment applies to genes that do not influence each other, while linked genes follow the 1:3:9:3 pattern because the genes are inherited together.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), and plain brown (3).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis aligns with the 1:3:9:3 ratio, but inverted. Because in the 1:3:9:3 pattern, the order is checkered red (cc) first, followed by checkered brown (cc Bb), then plain red (cc bb), and finally plain brown (C_ bb). So option E has the same sequence but with higher numbers for the latter two, which is correct.\n\nWait, but hold on: checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 3. Yes, that's exactly the 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since both parents are homozygous (one dominant, one recessive for each gene?), no\u2014wait,Parent 1 is CC BB, so both alleles for C and B are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so both alleles for c and b are recessive. So their F1 would be CcBb, where C and B are dominant, c and b are recessive. Thus, in F1, all birds have C (dominant) and B (dominant), so all phenotypes would be pigmented red and brown. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would consist of all four possible phenotypes, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment and random segregation).

Let me approach it differently. Since each bird has two genes, and each gene contributes to either pigment color or body color, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. Each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of the two genes.

Therefore, all offspring from this cross will have the genotype CcBb, and thus the same phenotype. This would mean that all F2 birds are identical, leading to a monohybrid-like ratio, but in reality, since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will be the same, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic distribution. However, this contradicts the typical dihybrid cross scenario where multiple phenotypes emerge due to different combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. Perhaps the confusion arises because the question refers to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will have the same genotype and phenotype. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, but the options provided suggest varying ratios. This indicates that my understanding might be incomplete or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the genetic principles.

In this case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have multiple genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nLet me try recalculating with this assumption. Suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would involve selfing this bird. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at a 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes to phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, Body color brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc: Pigment red, Body color brown \u2192 Red Brown (since C is dominant)\n3. cc: Pigment plain, Body color brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, Body color checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n\nAdding them up: 25+25+25+25=100%, so each phenotype would occur equally. However, none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking back at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Adding these gives 12+2+2+2=18, which doesn't add up to 100%. Option A mentions checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, totaling 16, which also doesn't make sense. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, adding to 12, which is less than 100%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous for one gene) and Parent 2 is BB (homozygous for the other gene). That way, the F1 would be CcBB, but that still seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps one parent is CC (for pigment) and the other is BB (for body), making all offspring CcBB, which would have a monophenotypic ratio. But that doesn't fit the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous checkered red would imply that both alleles are dominant for the checkered color (so C is dominant), and the red color comes from the recessive allele (c). Similarly, plain brown would have B as dominant and b as recessive. Therefore, Parent 1 is CC bb (no, wait\u2014if it's checkered red, that would mean the bird is C (dominant) and c (recessive), but wait, the wording is confusing. Let me clarify: The term \"checkered\" refers to the absence of the recessive allele, meaning the bird has at least one dominant allele. So a bird that is \"checkered\" must have at least one dominant allele (either C or B).\n\nTherefore, a \"homogeneous\" bird could be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. So a homozygous checkered red bird would have both alleles as dominant, meaning CC (pigment red) and bb (body black). Wait, but the color is described as \"checkered,\" which typically refers to a pattern without color, meaning the bird has at least one dominant allele. So, in terms of color, it would be red (because at least one C) and brown (because at least one B). Therefore, the genotype for a checkered red bird would be CC (for pigment) and Bb (for color)? Or maybe it's simply CC for pigment and bb for color, making it checkered? I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term is being used differently. Let me look up the terminology. \"Checkered\" usually refers to the lack of color, i.e., the bird has at least one dominant allele but lacks the recessive one. So, for example, a bird with genotype C_B_ would be checkered if B is recessive and _ is dominant. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify this.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the key is to proceed with the assumption that both parents are homozygous for each gene separately. So Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But since none of the answer choices reflect equal ratios, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous dominant) and Parent 2 is BB (homozygous dominant), making all offspring CcBB, resulting in a monophenotypic ratio. Again, this wouldn't match the answer choices.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous for the pigment gene). Wait, but the problem states that Parent 2 is plain brown, which is homozygous recessive. So perhaps Parent 1 is CC (homozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous?), but that doesn't align with the description.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is CC (homozygous dominant for pigment) and Parent 2 is Bb (heterozygous for color). But that changes things entirely. The problem specifies that Parent 1 is checkered red and Parent 2 is plain brown, which are both homozygous. Therefore, all offspring will be CcBb, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the answer choices reflect this.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are categorized. Let me consider the possible phenotypes based on the dominant alleles. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- c_: Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown\n- b_: Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Red Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Red Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these combinations would have a certain probability based on the parents' genotypes. Since both parents are homozygous, all F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be a dihybrid cross. However, in standard Mendelian dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but that assumes independent assortment and certain dominance relationships. Here, dominance is straightforward: C is dominant for pigment, B for body.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach gene is segregating independently. For pigment color (C):\n\n- 25% chance of C_ (pigment red)\n- 25% chance of cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n\n- 25% chance of B_ (brown)\n- 25% chance of bb (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are the product of the probabilities for each trait. However, this approach would lead to the following phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% of the time\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Plain and Brown: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Plain and Checkered: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nThis sums to 25%, but that doesn't match the answer options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, such as considering each gene independently and summing the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nWait, another approach: for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of pigment and body colors. Since the traits are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering all possible combinations. However, this would require enumerating all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is present in the F1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific traits. However, given the dominance hierarchy, some of these might combine into fewer phenotypes. For example:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nIf we group the phenotypes where the same combination of dominant and recessive alleles appear, we can have:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nHowever, in reality, these are four distinct phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But the answer options don't include 25% ratios. They instead provide various combinations. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, which is too low. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 7, plain brown 5. Also 16, which is too low. Option F: 12,2,2,2, adding to 18. Option G: 12,2,2,2. Same as F. Option H: 5,3,2,6. Adding to 16. None seem to reach 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Maybe the dihybrid cross involves two separate genes, each contributing to the phenotype, and the F2 generation includes all possible combinations. However, given that the user is asking for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, perhaps I need to consider the F2 as a result of a dihybrid cross between two F1 individuals, each of whom is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming dominance applies, each of these four genotypes translates to a specific phenotype. However, if the question considers the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 25% (CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nWait, no\u2014CC BB and cc BB both have pigment red, so those would be Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, CC Bb and cc Bb have Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nAnd for the Plain phenotype:\n\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B_) \u2192 25% (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 25% (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 50% (25% +25%)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (25% of CC Bb and 25% of cc Bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc bb)\n\nBut the answer options don't reflect this exactly. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding to 12. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding to 16. Option I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recalculate. If all four genotypes occur equally in F2, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain and Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nThat's impossible because it exceeds 100%. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are grouped. Perhaps the user expects us to count phenotypes where each combination of dominant and recessive alleles counts towards the phenotype, regardless of the other gene. That would mean:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nAdding up to 100%. But this doesn't explain the answer options either. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Adding to 16. Option D: 1,3,7,5. Also 16. Option F:12,2,2,2. Adding to 18. Option G:12,2,2,2. Same as F. Option H:5,3,2,6. Also 16. Option I:7,5,1,3. 16. Option J:2,6,3,1. Adding to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, grouping Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C_B_), Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb), Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown (cc_B_), Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (cc_bb). But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, and the answer options don't directly address this grouping. Instead, they provide numerical values indicating the occurrence of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the ratio expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype type observed.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So let's consider each possible phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but wait, this isn't possible because if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will have pigment red, regardless of B.)\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Since each bird has two genes, and each gene contributes to either pigment color or body color, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. Each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of the two genes. However, given that the genes are acting independently, the actual number of distinct phenotypes may vary.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene has two alleles, and each bird will display a phenotype based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For each gene, the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding trait, while the recessive allele hides it. Therefore, each bird will have a specific combination of traits depending on the alleles inherited from each parent. However, since the parents are both homozygous, all offspring will inherit the same alleles as the parents. Therefore, all offspring will have the same genotype and thus the same phenotype. That can't be right because the user is asking about a dihybrid cross, implying multiple phenotypes. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), so all offspring from this parent will receive C for the first gene and B for the second gene. Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), so all offspring will receive c for the first gene and b for the second gene. Therefore, all offspring from this cross will have the genotype CcBb, and thus the same phenotype. This would mean that all F2 birds are identical, leading to a monohybrid-like ratio, but in reality, since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will be the same, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic distribution. However, this contradicts the typical dihybrid cross scenario where multiple phenotypes emerge due to different combinations of dominant and recessive alleles. Perhaps the confusion arises because the question refers to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will have the same genotype and phenotype. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, but the options provided suggest varying ratios. This indicates that my understanding might be incomplete or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the genetic principles. Another possibility is that the parents are not necessarily homozygous in both genes simultaneously, but rather, perhaps, one parent is homozygous for one gene and the other parent is homozygous for the other. In this case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have multiple genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nLet me try recalculating with this assumption. Suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would involve selfing this bird. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at a 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes to phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, Body color brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Cc: Pigment red, Body color brown \u2192 Red Brown (since C is dominant)\n3. cc: Pigment plain, Body color brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, Body color checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n\nAdding them up: 25+25+25+25=100%, so each phenotype would occur equally. However, none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking back at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Adding these gives 12+2+2+2=18, which doesn't add up to 100%. Option A mentions checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, totaling 16, which also doesn't make sense. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, adding to 12, which is less than 100%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous for one gene) and Parent 2 is BB (homozygous for the other gene). That way, the F1 would be CcBB, but that still seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps one parent is CC (for pigment) and the other is BB (for body), making all offspring CcBB, which would have a monophenotypic ratio. But that doesn't fit the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous checkered red would imply that both alleles are dominant for the checkered color (so C is dominant), and the red color comes from the recessive allele (c). Similarly, plain brown would have B as dominant and b as recessive. Therefore, Parent 1 is CC bb (no, wait\u2014if it's checkered red, that would mean the bird is C (dominant) and c (recessive), but wait, the wording is confusing. Let me clarify: The term \"checkered\" refers to the absence of the recessive allele, meaning the bird has at least one dominant allele. So a bird that is \"checkered\" must have at least one dominant allele (either C or B).\n\nTherefore, a \"homogeneous\" bird could be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. So a homozygous checkered red bird would have both alleles as dominant, meaning CC (pigment red) and bb (body black). Wait, but the color is described as \"checkered,\" which typically refers to a pattern without color, meaning the bird has at least one dominant allele. So, in terms of color, it would be red (because at least one C) and brown (because at least one B). Therefore, the genotype for a checkered red bird would be CC (for pigment) and Bb (for color)? Or maybe it's simply CC for pigment and bb for color, making it checkered? I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term is being used differently. Let me look up the terminology. \"Checkered\" usually refers to the lack of color, i.e., the bird has at least one dominant allele but lacks the recessive one. So, for example, a bird with genotype C_B_ would be checkered if B is recessive and _ is dominant. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify this.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the key is to proceed with the assumption that both parents are homozygous for each gene separately. So Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But since none of the answer choices reflect equal ratios, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous dominant) and Parent 2 is BB (homozygous dominant), making all offspring CcBB, resulting in a monophenotypic ratio. Again, this wouldn't match the answer choices.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe Parent 1 is CC (homozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous for the pigment gene). Wait, but the problem states that Parent 2 is plain brown, which is homozygous recessive. So perhaps Parent 1 is CC (homozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous?), but that doesn't align with the description.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is CC (homozygous dominant for pigment) and Parent 2 is Bb (heterozygous for color). But that changes things entirely. The problem specifies that Parent 1 is checkered red and Parent 2 is plain brown, which are both homozygous. Therefore, all offspring will be CcBb, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, none of the answer choices reflect this.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are categorized. Let me consider the possible phenotypes based on the dominant alleles. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- c_: Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown\n- b_: Checkered\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Red Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Red Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these combinations would have a certain probability based on the parents' genotypes. Since both parents are homozygous, all F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be a dihybrid cross. However, in standard Mendelian dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but that assumes independent assortment and certain dominance relationships. Here, dominance is straightforward: C is dominant for pigment, B for body.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach gene is segregating independently. For pigment color (C):\n\n- 25% chance of C_ (pigment red)\n- 25% chance of cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n\n- 25% chance of B_ (brown)\n- 25% chance of bb (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are the product of the probabilities for each trait. However, this approach would lead to the following phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% of the time\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Plain and Brown: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Plain and Checkered: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nThis sums to 25%, but that doesn't match the answer options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, such as considering each gene independently and summing the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nWait, another approach: for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of pigment and body colors. Since the traits are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering all possible combinations. However, this would require enumerating all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is present in the F1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific traits. However, given the dominance hierarchy, some of these might combine into fewer phenotypes. For example:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nIf we group the phenotypes where the same combination of dominant and recessive alleles appear, we can have:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nHowever, in reality, these are four distinct phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But the answer options don't include 25% ratios. They instead provide various combinations. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, which is too low. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 7, plain brown 5. Also 16, which is too low. Option F: 12,2,2,2, adding to 18. Option G: 12,2,2,2. Same as F. Option H: 5,3,2,6. Adding to 16. None seem to reach 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Maybe the dihybrid cross involves two separate genes, each contributing to the phenotype, and the F2 generation includes all possible combinations. However, given that the user is asking for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, perhaps I need to consider the F2 as a result of a dihybrid cross between two F1 individuals, each of whom is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming dominance applies, each of these four genotypes translates to a specific phenotype. However, if the question considers the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 25% (CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nWait, no\u2014CC BB and cc BB both have pigment red, so those would be Pigment red and Brown. Similarly, CC Bb and cc Bb have Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nAnd for the Plain phenotype:\n\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B_) \u2192 25% (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 25% (cc bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 50% (25% +25%)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (25% of CC Bb and 25% of cc Bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc bb)\n\nBut the answer options don't reflect this exactly. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding to 12. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding to 16. Option I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recalculate. If all four genotypes occur equally in F2, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain and Brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nThat's impossible because it exceeds 100%. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are grouped. Perhaps the user expects us to count phenotypes where each combination of dominant and recessive alleles counts towards the phenotype, regardless of the other gene. That would mean:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 25% (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 25% (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc_bb)\n\nAdding up to 100%. But this doesn't explain the answer options either. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Adding to 16. Option D: 1,3,7,5. Also 16. Option F:12,2,2,2. Adding to 18. Option G:12,2,2,2. Same as F. Option H:5,3,2,6. Also 16. Option I:7,5,1,3. 16. Option J:2,6,3,1. Adding to 12.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, grouping Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C_B_), Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb), Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown (cc_B_), Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (cc_bb). But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, and the answer options don't directly address this grouping. Instead, they provide numerical values indicating the occurrence of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the ratio expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype type observed. Given that, if all four phenotypes occur equally",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, for example, if a bird is cc bb, it'll be plain and checkered. If it's Cc BB, it'll be red and brown. Similarly, Cc bb would be red and checkered, and cc BB plain and brown, and cc bb plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, none of them match this directly. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The F2 generation comes from the F1 cross, which was formed from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, we can determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 All CcBb will have this, except those without C or B.\nWait, no\u2014wait, the actual phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - If the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown.\n  - Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): Both traits expressed. This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. The probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1? Wait, no\u2014that's not right because each bird must have both traits if both genes are dominant. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So, a bird with CC BB will have both traits expressed (red and brown). A bird with CB Bb will also have both traits expressed (red and brown). A bird with CB bb will have red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with Cc BB will have red and brown. Wait, no\u2014no, each bird has two separate genes, so the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the phenotype for that trait. So, the phenotype for pigment color is red if the bird has at least one C allele, regardless of the B gene. Similarly, the phenotype for body color is brown if the bird has at least one B allele, regardless of the C gene. Therefore, the overall phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 25%\n- Plain and checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which isn't the case here because some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B dominant, then it's red and brown. If it has C dominant but B recessive, it's red and checkered. If it has c and B dominant, it's plain and brown. And if it has c and B recessive, it's plain and checkered. So indeed, each of these four phenotypes accounts for 25% of the population. But looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which seems different from what I'm thinking.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, for example, if a bird is cc bb, it'll be plain and checkered. If it's Cc BB, it'll be red and brown. Similarly, Cc bb would be red and checkered, and cc BB plain and brown, and cc bb plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, none of them match this directly. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The F2 generation comes from the F1 cross, which was formed from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, we can determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. \n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C present \u2192 red\n- c absent \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 All CcBb will have this, except those without C or B.\nWait, no\u2014wait, the actual phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C): \n  - If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red.\n  - Otherwise, it's plain.\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - If the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown.\n  - Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): Both traits expressed. This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. The probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1? Wait, no\u2014that's not right because each bird must have both traits if both genes are dominant. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So, a bird with CC BB will have both traits expressed (red and brown). A bird with CB Bb will also have both traits expressed (red and brown). A bird with CB bb will have red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with Cc BB will have red and brown. Wait, no\u2014no, each bird has two separate genes, so the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects the phenotype for that trait. So, the phenotype for pigment color is red if the bird has at least one C allele, regardless of the B gene. Similarly, the phenotype for body color is brown if the bird has at least one B allele, regardless of the C gene. Therefore, the overall phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\n- Plain and brown: c and B dominant \u2192 25%\n- Plain and checkered: c and B recessive \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, which isn't the case here because some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both C and B dominant, then it's red and brown. If it has C dominant but B recessive, it's red and checkered. If it has c and B dominant, it's plain and brown. And if it has c and B recessive, it's plain and checkered. So indeed, each of these four phenotypes accounts for 25% of the population. But looking at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which seems different from what I'm thinking. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16, which doesn't add up to 100%.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But if either gene is recessive, it won't.",
    "rollout": " But if either gene is recessive, it won't. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible genotypes for each gene and then determine the corresponding phenotype. But that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the genes are independent, the number of phenotypic classes is (number of pigment classes) * (number of color classes). Here, each bird can have pigment red or plain (two options), and color brown or checkered (two options), making four phenotypic classes.\n\nNow, let's compute the frequency of each class:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): c recessive, B dominant \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): both recessive \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive, given the parent's genotypes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant). Parent 2 is cc bb (both recessive for both genes).\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C):\n  - Parent 1: CC \u2192 always C (dominant)\n  - Parent 2: cc \u2192 always c (recessive)\n\n- For the color gene (B):\n  - Parent 1: BB \u2192 always B (dominant)\n  - Parent 2: bb \u2192 always b (recessive)\n\nTherefore, all offspring will inherit CC from Parent 1 and bb from Parent 2, leading to Cc for the pigment gene and Bb for the color gene. Because all offspring will have the same genotype (Cc Bb), their phenotypes will be the same.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then each F1 must receive one allele from each parent. So the F1 will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc for the pigment gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb for the color gene. Thus, all F1 individuals are Cc Bb, which results in:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSince all F1 are Cc Bb, they all exhibit the same phenotype. Wait, that's confusing because earlier I thought the F1 would be different, but according to this analysis, all F1 are Cc Bb, hence all phenotypes are the same. So in F1, all birds have the same phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs to produce F2, all F2 will also be Cc Bb, thus all phenotypes will be the same. This seems contradictory because in reality, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and selfing would lead to F2 with various combinations. But according to our analysis, all F1 are Cc Bb, hence all phenotypes are the same. So the F2 will all have the same phenotype as F1.\n\nWait, but the user's options don't seem to align with this conclusion. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Option A says checkered red 6, etc. So none of them match my calculation where all F2 have the same phenotype.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes, and Parent 2 is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So all F1 will be Cc Bb, leading to all the same phenotype. Hence, in F2, all will have the same phenotype. But looking at the answer choices, none directly state this. However, option D shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous, but instead, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are 'checkered.' Similarly, homozygous plain brown would have both alleles as 'plain.' Therefore, Parent 1 is Cc BB? Wait, no\u2014wait, the notation is usually written as CC for dominant, so Homozygous checkered red would be Cc BB? Wait, no\u2014that's not possible because the notation is usually CC for dominant. Wait, confusion arises because sometimes uppercase letters denote dominant, lowercase recessive. So Homozygous checkered red bird would be Cc BB? No, that's not right because if it's checkered, it's recessive, so both alleles would be 'checkered.' So Homozygous checkered red would be cc BB? Wait, no\u2014that can't be because both parents are stated differently. Wait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me clarify: the problem states that one parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, and the other is a plain brown bird. So for Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red. Since checkered is recessive, both alleles must be 'checkered,' so the genotype would be cc BB. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because if the bird is checkered, it's recessive, so both alleles are 'checkered.' So the genotype would be cc BB. But wait, that's impossible because if the bird is checkered, both alleles are recessive. So Homozygous checkered red bird would be cc BB. And Homozygous plain brown bird would be cc bb. That makes more sense because then the F1 would be Cc Bb, as previously considered, leading to all F2 having the same phenotype. But according to the options, none directly reflect this. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation uses uppercase for dominant and lowercase for recessive, regardless of the bird's phenotype. So, for example, Homozygous checkered red bird would be cc BB because both alleles are recessive. Homozygous plain brown bird would be cc bb. Therefore, Parent 1 is cc BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. In this case, all F1 would receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1: cc (so both alleles are recessive, hence 'checkered') and Parent 2: cc (also 'checkered'). So F1 would get one allele from each, resulting in cc (for both genes). Wait, but that would make F1 as cc BB, which is a homozygous dominant, which would be red and brown. Then F2 would be all cc BB, leading to the same phenotype. Again, this brings us back to all F2 having the same phenotype, which isn't reflected in the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me try interpreting the parents as such: Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). So F1 would be Cc Bb, and all F1 would have the same genotype, hence same phenotype. Then, F2 would all be Cc Bb, same phenotype. But the options don't show this. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the parents.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one parent is homozygous dominant for pigment (CC) and the other is homozygous recessive for pigment (cc). But the problem specifies \"homogeneous,\" so probably both are homozygous. Therefore, F1 would be Cc Bb, and all F2 would also be Cc Bb, same phenotype. But the options don't include this situation. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Wait a minute, perhaps the notation is reversed. Instead of checkingered being recessive, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe in the problem, the notation is such that dominant uppercase letters represent dominant traits, and recessive lowercase letters represent recessive traits. So, for example, if a bird is checkered, it's recessive (lowercase), so genotype would be cc. But the problem states that checkered is a dominant color, which contradicts standard notation unless the capital letters represent dominant traits. Alternatively, perhaps the capital letters represent the phenotype, and lowercases the genotype. So, if a bird is checkered, it's genotype cc and phenotype checkered. Similarly, a plain bird is genotype BB (assuming uppercase is dominant, but that's conflicting because if checkered is recessive, it should have lowercase). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the assumption that the parents are as described, and see what happens.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), then F1 would be Cc Bb. All F1 would inherit one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. Therefore, their phenotype would be Pigmented red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant), i.e., phenotype 1.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, all F2 will inherit Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotype. Therefore, all F2 are Pigmented red and Brown. So in the F2 generation, all birds will exhibit the same phenotype: Pigmented red and Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options provided. This suggests that I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me reconsider the parents. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Perhaps Parent 1 is CC (heterozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous), but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), leading to F1 being Cc Bb and all F2 being Cc Bb, same phenotype. But again, the options don't reflect this.\n\nPerhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me look up similar problems to confirm. Typically, in genetics problems, uppercase letters denote dominant traits, and lowercase denote recessive. So, for example, a bird with genotype BB will be Phenotype B, and a bird with genotype Bb will be Phenotype B (dominant), while a bird with genotype bb will be Phenotype b.\n\nIn this problem, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, implying that C is dominant and checkered is dominant. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts because if C is dominant, then checkered (which is recessive) would be expressed only when C is absent. Wait, that can't be. Checkered is recessive, so the presence of at least one dominant allele (C) would mask the checkered phenotype. So, if C is dominant, then checkered (c) is expressed only when C is present (i.e., when the bird is Cc or CC). Conversely, if C is recessive, then checkered would be dominant. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me define the terms properly.\n\nLet me assign:\n\n- Gene C: Determines pigment color.\n  - C (dominant): Red (phenotype R)\n  - c (recessive): Checkered (phenotype r)\n- Gene B: Determines body color.\n  - B (dominant): Brown (phenotype W)\n  - b (recessive): Checkered (phenotype w)\n\nTherefore, the phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. If both C and B are present (C is dominant, B is dominant), the bird will have both red and brown features, resulting in a specific phenotype. If any of the required alleles are missing, the phenotype changes accordingly.\n\nGiven this, let's analyze the parents again. Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes). Therefore, all offspring will inherit CC for gene C and BB for gene B. Therefore, their phenotype will be Pigmented red (R) and Brown (W), specifically Phenotype 1.\n\nParent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all offspring will inherit cc for gene C and bb for gene B. Therefore, their phenotype will be Plain red (r) and Checkered (w), specifically Phenotype 2.\n\nThus, F1 will be all Cc Bb (as the parents produce only Cc Bb gametes due to independent assortment), leading to all F2 being Cc Bb as well. Therefore, all F2 will have the same phenotype: Pigmented red and Brown. So, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 100% for that phenotype, which isn't among the options. This suggests that either the parents are not both homozygous, or there's a miscalculation elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but rather one is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive. Let's suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). As before, F1 is Cc Bb, and all F2 are Cc Bb, leading to same phenotype. But the options don't support this outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both heterozygous. Let me reinterpret the parents as:\n\nParent 1: Cc BB (heterozygous dominant for C, homozygous dominant for B)\nParent 2: cc bb (heterozygous recessive for C, homozygous recessive for B)\n\nIn this case, F1 would be a combination of Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), since each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will consist of combinations:\n\n- CC (from Cc x Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 will be calculated using Punnett squares. For the C locus (gene C):\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\nParent 2: cc \u2192 can produce c\n\nSo F1 (Cc) x F1 (cc):\n\nPossible gametes:\n- C (from Cc)\n- c (from Cc)\n- c (from cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 (Cc) from Parent 1 (Cc BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb) would produce gametes:\n\nFor C (gene C):\n\nFrom Parent 1: C and c (since it's Cc)\nFrom Parent 2: c (since it's cc)\n\nSo possible gametes for C: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\nSimilarly, for B (gene B):\n\nParent 1: BB (so only B)\nParent 2: bb (so only b)\nThus, possible gametes for B: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nTherefore, F1 (Cc BB) x F1 (cc bb) will produce gametes:\n\nFor C: C (parent 1) and c (parent 2)\nFor B: B (parent 1) and b (parent 2)\n\nSo F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor C: C (from C) + B (from B) \u2192 C B\n           C (from C) + b (from B) \u2192 C b\n           c (from C) + B \u2192 c B\n           c (from C) + b \u2192 c b\n\nFor B: B (from B) + B \u2192 BB\n             B + b \u2192 Bb\n             b + B \u2192 Bb\n             b + b \u2192 bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% C B (C B)\n- 25% C b (C b)\n- 25% c B (c B)\n- 25% c b (c b)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes, so the phenotype is determined by both C and B.\n\n- C B: C dominant \u2192 red, B dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown\n- C b: C dominant \u2192 red, b recessive \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigmented red and checkered\n- c B: c recessive \u2192 plain, B dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and brown\n- c b: c recessive \u2192 plain, b recessive \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the task is to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2.\n\nLooking at the genotypes:\n\n- 25% C B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% C b \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% c B \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% c b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo each phenotype has a 25% occurrence. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, this suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would imply a trihybrid cross with three loci, possibly with dominance and incomplete dominance. But in our current analysis, we have only two loci (C and B), each with two phenotypes, leading to four phenotypes in F2 with equal ratios. Therefore, the observed ratio would be ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, it won't. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible genotypes for each gene and then determine the corresponding phenotype. But that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the genes are independent, the number of phenotypic classes is (number of pigment classes) * (number of color classes). Here, each bird can have pigment red or plain (two options), and color brown or checkered (two options), making four phenotypic classes.\n\nNow, let's compute the frequency of each class:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): c recessive, B dominant \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): both recessive \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive, given the parent's genotypes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant). Parent 2 is cc bb (both recessive for both genes).\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C):\n  - Parent 1: CC \u2192 always C (dominant)\n  - Parent 2: cc \u2192 always c (recessive)\n\n- For the color gene (B):\n  - Parent 1: BB \u2192 always B (dominant)\n  - Parent 2: bb \u2192 always b (recessive)\n\nTherefore, all offspring will inherit CC from Parent 1 and bb from Parent 2, leading to Cc for the pigment gene and Bb for the color gene. Because all offspring will have the same genotype (Cc Bb), their phenotypes will be the same.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then each F1 must receive one allele from each parent. So the F1 will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc for the pigment gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb for the color gene. Thus, all F1 individuals are Cc Bb, which results in:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSince all F1 are Cc Bb, they all exhibit the same phenotype. Wait, that's confusing because earlier I thought the F1 would be different, but according to this analysis, all F1 are Cc Bb, hence all phenotypes are the same. So in F1, all birds have the same phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs to produce F2, all F2 will also be Cc Bb, thus all phenotypes will be the same. This seems contradictory because in reality, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and selfing would lead to F2 with various combinations. But according to our analysis, all F1 are Cc Bb, hence all phenotypes are the same. So the F2 will all have the same phenotype as F1.\n\nWait, but the user's options don't seem to align with this conclusion. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Option A says checkered red 6, etc. So none of them match my calculation where all F2 have the same phenotype.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes, and Parent 2 is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So all F1 will be Cc Bb, leading to all the same phenotype. Hence, in F2, all will have the same phenotype. But looking at the answer choices, none directly state this. However, option D shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous, but instead, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are 'checkered.' Similarly, homozygous plain brown would have both alleles as 'plain.' Therefore, Parent 1 is Cc BB? Wait, no\u2014wait, the notation is usually written as CC for dominant, so Homozygous checkered red would be Cc BB? Wait, no\u2014that's not possible because the notation is usually CC for dominant. Wait, confusion arises because sometimes uppercase letters denote dominant, lowercase recessive. So Homozygous checkered red bird would be Cc BB? No, that's not right because if it's checkered, it's recessive, so both alleles would be 'checkered.' So Homozygous checkered red would be cc BB? Wait, no\u2014that can't be because both parents are stated differently. Wait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me clarify: the problem states that one parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, and the other is a plain brown bird. So for Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red. Since checkered is recessive, both alleles must be 'checkered,' so the genotype would be cc BB. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because if the bird is checkered, it's recessive, so both alleles are 'checkered.' So the genotype would be cc BB. But wait, that's impossible because if the bird is checkered, both alleles are recessive. So Homozygous checkered red bird would be cc BB. And Homozygous plain brown bird would be cc bb. That makes more sense because then the F1 would be Cc Bb, as previously considered, leading to all F2 having the same phenotype. But according to the options, none directly reflect this. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation uses uppercase for dominant and lowercase for recessive, regardless of the bird's phenotype. So, for example, Homozygous checkered red bird would be cc BB because both alleles are recessive. Homozygous plain brown bird would be cc bb. Therefore, Parent 1 is cc BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. In this case, all F1 would receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1: cc (so both alleles are recessive, hence 'checkered') and Parent 2: cc (also 'checkered'). So F1 would get one allele from each, resulting in cc (for both genes). Wait, but that would make F1 as cc BB, which is a homozygous dominant, which would be red and brown. Then F2 would be all cc BB, leading to the same phenotype. Again, this brings us back to all F2 having the same phenotype, which isn't reflected in the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me try interpreting the parents as such: Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). So F1 would be Cc Bb, and all F1 would have the same genotype, hence same phenotype. Then, F2 would all be Cc Bb, same phenotype. But the options don't show this. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the parents.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one parent is homozygous dominant for pigment (CC) and the other is homozygous recessive for pigment (cc). But the problem specifies \"homogeneous,\" so probably both are homozygous. Therefore, F1 would be Cc Bb, and all F2 would also be Cc Bb, same phenotype. But the options don't include this situation. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Wait a minute, perhaps the notation is reversed. Instead of checkingered being recessive, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe in the problem, the notation is such that dominant uppercase letters represent dominant traits, and recessive lowercase letters represent recessive traits. So, for example, if a bird is checkered, it's recessive (lowercase), so genotype would be cc. But the problem states that checkered is a dominant color, which contradicts standard notation unless the capital letters represent dominant traits. Alternatively, perhaps the capital letters represent the phenotype, and lowercases the genotype. So, if a bird is checkered, it's genotype cc and phenotype checkered. Similarly, a plain bird is genotype BB (assuming uppercase is dominant, but that's conflicting because if checkered is recessive, it should have lowercase). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the assumption that the parents are as described, and see what happens.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), then F1 would be Cc Bb. All F1 would inherit one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. Therefore, their phenotype would be Pigmented red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant), i.e., phenotype 1.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, all F2 will inherit Cc Bb, leading to the same phenotype. Therefore, all F2 are Pigmented red and Brown. So in the F2 generation, all birds will exhibit the same phenotype: Pigmented red and Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options provided. This suggests that I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me reconsider the parents. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Perhaps Parent 1 is CC (heterozygous) and Parent 2 is cc (heterozygous), but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, perhaps Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), leading to F1 being Cc Bb and all F2 being Cc Bb, same phenotype. But again, the options don't reflect this.\n\nPerhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me look up similar problems to confirm. Typically, in genetics problems, uppercase letters denote dominant traits, and lowercase denote recessive. So, for example, a bird with genotype BB will be Phenotype B, and a bird with genotype Bb will be Phenotype B (dominant), while a bird with genotype bb will be Phenotype b.\n\nIn this problem, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, implying that C is dominant and checkered is dominant. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts because if C is dominant, then checkered (which is recessive) would be expressed only when C is absent. Wait, that can't be. Checkered is recessive, so the presence of at least one dominant allele (C) would mask the checkered phenotype. So, if C is dominant, then checkered (c) is expressed only when C is present (i.e., when the bird is Cc or CC). Conversely, if C is recessive, then checkered would be dominant. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me define the terms properly.\n\nLet me assign:\n\n- Gene C: Determines pigment color.\n  - C (dominant): Red (phenotype R)\n  - c (recessive): Checkered (phenotype r)\n- Gene B: Determines body color.\n  - B (dominant): Brown (phenotype W)\n  - b (recessive): Checkered (phenotype w)\n\nTherefore, the phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. If both C and B are present (C is dominant, B is dominant), the bird will have both red and brown features, resulting in a specific phenotype. If any of the required alleles are missing, the phenotype changes accordingly.\n\nGiven this, let's analyze the parents again. Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes). Therefore, all offspring will inherit CC for gene C and BB for gene B. Therefore, their phenotype will be Pigmented red (R) and Brown (W), specifically Phenotype 1.\n\nParent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Therefore, all offspring will inherit cc for gene C and bb for gene B. Therefore, their phenotype will be Plain red (r) and Checkered (w), specifically Phenotype 2.\n\nThus, F1 will be all Cc Bb (as the parents produce only Cc Bb gametes due to independent assortment), leading to all F2 being Cc Bb as well. Therefore, all F2 will have the same phenotype: Pigmented red and Brown. So, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 100% for that phenotype, which isn't among the options. This suggests that either the parents are not both homozygous, or there's a miscalculation elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but rather one is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive. Let's suppose Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). As before, F1 is Cc Bb, and all F2 are Cc Bb, leading to same phenotype. But the options don't support this outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both heterozygous. Let me reinterpret the parents as:\n\nParent 1: Cc BB (heterozygous dominant for C, homozygous dominant for B)\nParent 2: cc bb (heterozygous recessive for C, homozygous recessive for B)\n\nIn this case, F1 would be a combination of Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), since each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will consist of combinations:\n\n- CC (from Cc x Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 will be calculated using Punnett squares. For the C locus (gene C):\n\nParent 1: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c\nParent 2: cc \u2192 can produce c\n\nSo F1 (Cc) x F1 (cc):\n\nPossible gametes:\n- C (from Cc)\n- c (from Cc)\n- c (from cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 (Cc) from Parent 1 (Cc BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb) would produce gametes:\n\nFor C (gene C):\n\nFrom Parent 1: C and c (since it's Cc)\nFrom Parent 2: c (since it's cc)\n\nSo possible gametes for C: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\nSimilarly, for B (gene B):\n\nParent 1: BB (so only B)\nParent 2: bb (so only b)\nThus, possible gametes for B: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nTherefore, F1 (Cc BB) x F1 (cc bb) will produce gametes:\n\nFor C: C (parent 1) and c (parent 2)\nFor B: B (parent 1) and b (parent 2)\n\nSo F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor C: C (from C) + B (from B) \u2192 C B\n           C (from C) + b (from B) \u2192 C b\n           c (from C) + B \u2192 c B\n           c (from C) + b \u2192 c b\n\nFor B: B (from B) + B \u2192 BB\n             B + b \u2192 Bb\n             b + B \u2192 Bb\n             b + b \u2192 bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% C B (C B)\n- 25% C b (C b)\n- 25% c B (c B)\n- 25% c b (c b)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes, so the phenotype is determined by both C and B.\n\n- C B: C dominant \u2192 red, B dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown\n- C b: C dominant \u2192 red, b recessive \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigmented red and checkered\n- c B: c recessive \u2192 plain, B dominant \u2192 brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and brown\n- c b: c recessive \u2192 plain, b recessive \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the task is to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2.\n\nLooking at the genotypes:\n\n- 25% C B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% C b \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% c B \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% c b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo each phenotype has a 25% occurrence. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none of them match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, this suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would imply a trihybrid cross with three loci, possibly with dominance and incomplete dominance. But in our current analysis, we have only two loci (C and B), each with two phenotypes, leading to four phenotypes in F2 with equal ratios. Therefore, the observed ratio would be ",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't fully expressed due to incomplete dominance or something else, but the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, implying that the checkered pattern is recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy.

So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- CC Bb (25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%)\n- CC bb (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- Cc BB (50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%)\n- Cc Bb (50% \u00d7 50% = 25%)\n- Cc bb (50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%)\n- cc BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- cc Bb (25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%)\n- cc bb (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet's list each possible genotype and what phenotype it results in:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C recessive (as cc), B dominant \u2192 Plain, brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Both recessive (C and c) and dominant (B) \u2192 Plain, brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C recessive (cc), B recessive (bb) \u2192 Plain, checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain, checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain, checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (Phenotype A): Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 Total 6.25%\n- Pigment red and plain (Phenotype B): Case 4 \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain and brown (Phenotype C): Cases 5,6,7 \u2192 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 31.25%\n- Plain and checkered (Phenotype D): Cases 8,9 \u2192 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly, but let's see. The options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Ratios 6:2:6:2 (Total 16 parts)\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Ratios 8:4:0:4 (Total 16 parts)\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16 parts\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12+2+2+0=16\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12 \u2192 Not 16\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F\n\nLooking back, our calculations gave us:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: ~6.25% \u2192 Approximately 6 parts\n- Pigment red and plain: ~12.5% \u2192 Approximately 2 parts (but exact numbers vary)\n- Plain and brown: ~31.25% \u2192 About 3 parts (but needs precise calculation)\n- Plain and checkered: ~12.5% \u2192 Approximately 1 part\n\nHowever, the given answer choices don't directly align with my calculation. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express the probabilities in fractions to get exact counts.\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 (since 2^4 for each gene, but since it's dihybrid, 16 possible combinations).\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (A): CC BB \u2192 1/16\n2. Pigment red and plain (B): CC bb \u2192 1/16\n3. Plain and brown (C): Cc BB \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain and checkered (D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n5. Plain and brown (same as C): Cc BB \u2192 1/16\n6. Plain and checkered (same as D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n7. Plain and brown (same as C): Cc BB \u2192 1/16\n8. Plain and checkered (same as D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n9. Plain and checkered (same as D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, this approach seems confusing. Let me instead count how many of the 16 cases fall into each phenotype.\n\nEach possible genotype corresponds to one of the nine F2 genotypes, but some may combine into the same phenotype. However, when counting phenotypes, each unique phenotype is counted once regardless of how many genotypes lead to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square layout. Let me construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nThe F2 grid for a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red Plain)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Red Checkered)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain Brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5 (Plain Checkered)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1\n- Phenotype 2: 1\n- Phenotype 3: 1\n- Phenotype 4: 3 (cases 4,5,7)\n- Phenotype 5: 3 (cases 6,8,9)\n\nThis adds up to 1+1+1+3+3=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I missed some cases. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some phenotypes combine. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 9 cases:\n\n1. Red Brown\n2. Red Plain\n3. Red Checkered\n4. Plain Brown\n5. Plain Brown\n6. Plain Checkered\n7. Plain Brown\n8. Plain Checkered\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Red Brown: 1\n- Red Plain: 1\n- Red Checkered: 1\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 3\n\nTotal: 9, which is indeed 9 parts. But the options don't include 9 parts; option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypes based on the original description.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele, so a bird with both c and c (cc) will be checkered. Similarly, a bird with bb (both b) will be plain. Also, if a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it will be plain because the B locus is recessive. Similarly, if it has c and B, it'll be red because the C locus is recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's the reverse.\n\nNo, wait: C is dominant over c, so a bird with at least one C will have pigment red. B is dominant over b, so a bird with at least one B will have brown color. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C (from C/B) and B (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Pigment red and plain: C (from C/B) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Pigment red and checkered: c (from C/C) and B (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and brown: c (from C/C) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and checkered: c (from C/C) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So each of these four phenotypes represents 25% of the F2 population, totaling 100%. But then, why does the previous analysis show different counts?\n\nAh, I realize now\u2014I confused the phenotype grouping earlier. Let me recast the entire approach.\n\nEach of the 16 possible F2 genotypes maps to a specific phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's create a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Pigment red, brown\nCC Bb | Pigment red, plain\nCC bb | Pigment red, checkered\nCc BB | Plain, brown\nCc Bb | Plain, brown\nCc bb | Plain, checkered\ncc BB | Plain, brown\ncc Bb | Plain, checkered\ncc bb | Plain, checkered\n\nNow, assigning each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: CC BB \u2192 1\n- Pigment red and plain: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Pigment red and checkered: CC Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and brown: c c BB \u2192 1\n- Plain and brown: c c Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c BB \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c bb \u2192 1\n\nWait, this approach still seems off. Instead, let me assign each genotype to the corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1\n- Phenotype B: 1\n- Phenotype C: 1\n- Phenotype D: 4 (cases 4,5,7)\n- Phenotype E: 5 (cases 6,8,9)\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1+1+1+4+5=12, but the options don't have 12 parts. This indicates I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me reconsider the definition of phenotypes based on the presence or absence of certain traits.\n\nActually, the presence of pigment red and/or brown determines the main color, and the presence of checkered or plain determines the texture. So:\n\n- If a bird has pigment red and brown, it's either red (if it also has plain or checkered), but more accurately, it's simply red and brown. Similarly for other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the phenotypes based on the combination of presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Each bird's phenotype can be determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIn this case, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. Therefore, each of these four phenotypes would occupy 25% of the F2 population. However, this contradicts the previous analysis where some phenotypes had more counts. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting the actual number of genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet me try counting the actual number of F2 individuals leading to each phenotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: C and B are dominant \u2192 CC BB \u2192 1\n2. Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 CC bb \u2192 1\n3. Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 cc BB \u2192 1\n4. Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1\n\nAdding these up: 1+1+1+1=4, which is 4 parts out of 16, or 25%. But this doesn't align with the previous examples I considered, suggesting I must have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basics. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involves four possible phenotypes, each represented by a quarter of the population. However, sometimes these can overlap if certain conditions apply. In this case, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype would occur in 25% of the F2, so:\n\n- Red and brown: 1/4 of F2\n- Red and plain: 1/4\n- Red and checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and brown: 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: 1/4\n\nBut adding these up: 5 phenotypes, each 25%, totals 125%, which exceeds 100%. Thus, there must be overlaps. Wait, no\u2014if each bird can only have one phenotype, then the correct way is to categorize the phenotypes without overlapping. Let me map them correctly.\n\nActually, each bird can only have one phenotype. For example, a bird cannot be both red and plain unless it has both dominant alleles for both genes. Wait, no\u2014a bird can be both red and plain only if it has at least one dominant allele for pigment red and at least one dominant allele for plain color. But the definitions are separate: red pigment is from C, plain color is from B. So, a bird with C and B will have both red pigment and plain color, making it Phenotype 1. A bird with C and b will have red pigment but plain color, making it Phenotype 2. A bird with c and B will have plain color but red pigment, making it Phenotype 3. A bird with c and c will have plain color regardless of B, making it Phenotype 4.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases. Therefore, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 population. Hence, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes, sum",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So all F2 birds will display both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, but the options don't reflect that. Wait, but looking back, the options given include ratios like 6:2:6:2, which suggest multiple phenotypes. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't fully expressed due to incomplete dominance or something else, but the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, implying that the checkered pattern is recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: \n\n- Gene C: \n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\n- Gene B:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If a bird has C (dominant), it will have red pigment.\n- If a bird has B (dominant), it will have brown body color.\nTherefore, a bird with C and B will have both traits (red and brown).\nA bird with C and b will have red pigment but checkered body.\nA bird with c and B will have plain body but brown color.\nAnd a bird with c and b will have plain and checkered.\n\nNow, considering the parents: \n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All C and B alleles, so all offspring will be C and B, hence all red and brown.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All c and b alleles, so all offspring will be c and b, hence all plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but the F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb. Because each parent contributes either C or c for the C locus, and B or b for the B locus. So F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) would produce F2 with the following genotypes:\n\nFor C locus: \n- 25% CC (C from C and C)\n- 50% Cc (C and c)\n- 25% cc (c and c)\n\nFor B locus:\nSimilarly,\n- 25% BB (B and B)\n- 50% Bb (B and b)\n- 25% bb (b and b)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- CC Bb (25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%)\n- CC bb (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- Cc BB (50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%)\n- Cc Bb (50% \u00d7 50% = 25%)\n- Cc bb (50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5%)\n- cc BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- cc Bb (25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%)\n- cc bb (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet's list each possible genotype and what phenotype it results in:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C recessive (as cc), B dominant \u2192 Plain, brown\n5.

Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express the probabilities in fractions to get exact counts.\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 (since 2^4 for each gene, but since it's dihybrid, 16 possible combinations).\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (A): CC BB \u2192 1/16\n2. Pigment red and plain (B): CC bb \u2192 1/16\n3. Plain and brown (C): Cc BB \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain and checkered (D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n5.

Plain and checkered (same as D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n9. Plain and checkered (same as D): Cc bb \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, this approach seems confusing. Let me instead count how many of the 16 cases fall into each phenotype.\n\nEach possible genotype corresponds to one of the nine F2 genotypes, but some may combine into the same phenotype. However, when counting phenotypes, each unique phenotype is counted once regardless of how many genotypes lead to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square layout. Let me construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nThe F2 grid for a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red Plain)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Red Checkered)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain Brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5 (Plain Checkered)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 5\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1\n- Phenotype 2: 1\n- Phenotype 3: 1\n- Phenotype 4: 3 (cases 4,5,7)\n- Phenotype 5: 3 (cases 6,8,9)\n\nThis adds up to 1+1+1+3+3=9, which is less than 16. Hmm, perhaps I missed some cases. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some phenotypes combine. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 9 cases:\n\n1. Red Brown\n2. Red Plain\n3. Red Checkered\n4. Plain Brown\n5. Plain Brown\n6. Plain Checkered\n7. Plain Brown\n8. Plain Checkered\n9. Plain Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Red Brown: 1\n- Red Plain: 1\n- Red Checkered: 1\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 3\n\nTotal: 9, which is indeed 9 parts. But the options don't include 9 parts; option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypes based on the original description.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele, so a bird with both c and c (cc) will be checkered. Similarly, a bird with bb (both b) will be plain. Also, if a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it will be plain because the B locus is recessive. Similarly, if it has c and B, it'll be red because the C locus is recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's the reverse.\n\nNo, wait: C is dominant over c, so a bird with at least one C will have pigment red. B is dominant over b, so a bird with at least one B will have brown color. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C (from C/B) and B (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Pigment red and plain: C (from C/B) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Pigment red and checkered: c (from C/C) and B (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and brown: c (from C/C) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and checkered: c (from C/C) and b (from B/b) \u2192 25% of F2\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So each of these four phenotypes represents 25% of the F2 population, totaling 100%. But then, why does the previous analysis show different counts?\n\nAh, I realize now\u2014I confused the phenotype grouping earlier. Let me recast the entire approach.\n\nEach of the 16 possible F2 genotypes maps to a specific phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's create a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Pigment red, brown\nCC Bb | Pigment red, plain\nCC bb | Pigment red, checkered\nCc BB | Plain, brown\nCc Bb | Plain, brown\nCc bb | Plain, checkered\ncc BB | Plain, brown\ncc Bb | Plain, checkered\ncc bb | Plain, checkered\n\nNow, assigning each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: CC BB \u2192 1\n- Pigment red and plain: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Pigment red and checkered: CC Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and brown: c c BB \u2192 1\n- Plain and brown: c c Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c BB \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c Bb \u2192 1\n- Plain and checkered: c c bb \u2192 1\n\nWait, this approach still seems off. Instead, let me assign each genotype to the corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype E\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: 1\n- Phenotype B: 1\n- Phenotype C: 1\n- Phenotype D: 4 (cases 4,5,7)\n- Phenotype E: 5 (cases 6,8,9)\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1+1+1+4+5=12, but the options don't have 12 parts. This indicates I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me reconsider the definition of phenotypes based on the presence or absence of certain traits.\n\nActually, the presence of pigment red and/or brown determines the main color, and the presence of checkered or plain determines the texture. So:\n\n- If a bird has pigment red and brown, it's either red (if it also has plain or checkered), but more accurately, it's simply red and brown. Similarly for other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the phenotypes based on the combination of presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Each bird's phenotype can be determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Both C and B recessive: Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIn this case, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. Therefore, each of these four phenotypes would occupy 25% of the F2 population. However, this contradicts the previous analysis where some phenotypes had more counts. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting the actual number of genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet me try counting the actual number of F2 individuals leading to each phenotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: C and B are dominant \u2192 CC BB \u2192 1\n2. Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 CC bb \u2192 1\n3. Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 cc BB \u2192 1\n4. Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1\n\nAdding these up: 1+1+1+1=4, which is 4 parts out of 16, or 25%. But this doesn't align with the previous examples I considered, suggesting I must have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basics. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross involves four possible phenotypes, each represented by a quarter of the population. However, sometimes these can overlap if certain conditions apply. In this case, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype would occur in 25% of the F2, so:\n\n- Red and brown: 1/4 of F2\n- Red and plain: 1/4\n- Red and checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and brown: 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: 1/4\n\nBut adding these up: 5 phenotypes, each 25%, totals 125%, which exceeds 100%. Thus, there must be overlaps. Wait, no\u2014if each bird can only have one phenotype, then the correct way is to categorize the phenotypes without overlapping. Let me map them correctly.\n\nActually, each bird can only have one phenotype. For example, a bird cannot be both red and plain unless it has both dominant alleles for both genes. Wait, no\u2014a bird can be both red and plain only if it has at least one dominant allele for pigment red and at least one dominant allele for plain color. But the definitions are separate: red pigment is from C, plain color is from B. So, a bird with C and B will have both red pigment and plain color, making it Phenotype 1. A bird with C and b will have red pigment but plain color, making it Phenotype 2. A bird with c and B will have plain color but red pigment, making it Phenotype 3. A bird with c and c will have plain color regardless of B, making it Phenotype 4.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases. Therefore, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 population. Hence, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes, sum",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in both traits being expressed.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in both traits being expressed. So in this case, every bird in the F2 generation would have pigment red and brown, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, but that contradicts the given options. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation without considering dominance beyond what's given. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual phenotypic ratios based on the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nWait, looking back, the options don't include 100% for any phenotype. The highest option is H with 5 checkered red, 3 brown red, 2 red brown, and 6 brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me approach this differently. Since both genes determine coat color, and the F2 generation consists of 16 possible combinations, each with a certain probability. The phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Phenotype A: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this would imply 100%, which isn't possible)\n- Similarly, Phenotype B: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype C: P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype D: P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis can't be right because it suggests that all birds would have both traits, which isn't realistic. Instead, I must be missing something. Perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome. Wait, in this case, both genes are acting independently. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. Therefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will have the respective trait. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C): Always true unless both c alleles are present.\n- Brown (B): Always true unless both b alleles are present.\n\nSo the only way a bird won't have both traits is if it has neither C nor B alleles. Which would require both c and b alleles. But since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the chance of having neither C nor B is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, and similarly for neither B nor b. So the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and brown (has at least one C and one B)\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and checkered (has at least one C but lacks B)\nPhenotype C: Plain and brown (lacks C but has B)\nPhenotype D: Plain and checkered (lacks both)\n\nThe probability for each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 - (probability of neither C nor B) = 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16? Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4 (since only 1/4 has both c alleles). Similarly, the probability of having at least one B allele is also 3/4. Therefore, the probability that a bird has both traits (A) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which again seems off. This suggests that all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the standard genetics where both traits are expressed if any dominant allele is present. So perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations rather than probabilities.\n\nGiven that, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes from a dihybrid cross (parental genotypes: CC BB and cc bb):\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- Cc (for C)\n- Bb (for B)\n\nThus, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (prob: 25%)\n2. CC Bb (prob: 25%)\n3. cc BB (prob: 25%)\n4. cc Bb (prob: 25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor B locus (body color):\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype E\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype E\n3. cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype F\n4. cc Bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nWait, but according to the given options, none of them mention Phenotype E and F as separate. Looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. All equal\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\n\nWait, looking at option K: 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. That seems logical because for the C locus, half the population is red (including checkered), and for the B locus, half the population is brown (including checkered). Therefore, the combinations would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Cc, Bb): (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc, Bb): same, 6.25%\n- Plain red (cc, Bb): 6.25%\n- Plain brown (Cc, bb): 6.25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 25% each, totaling 100%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 6.25% each, but since the options use whole numbers, perhaps they round to 4:4:4:4, which totals 16 parts, but the sum doesn't match 100%. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in terms of counts, ignoring percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait for each gene. For example, if pigment color is considered, regardless of body color. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective trait, leading to all birds having both traits, resulting in a 100% checkered-red and 100% checkered-brown, which isn't matching the options. \n\nWait, looking back at the options, option K says 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. Adding those up gives 16, which might represent 100% across 16 birds. Each category represents 25% of the population, so 4 out of 16 equals 25%. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or simplified, 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none directly say that. Option K is the closest, but it's phrased as \"4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown.\" So that would correspond to 4 each, totaling 16, representing 25% each. Therefore, the answer might be option K, but I'm a bit confused because my initial thought was that all birds would have both traits, but perhaps the question is intended to assume that each bird has a 50% chance for each trait, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing it properly. The F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but actually, each parent produces gametes with either the dominant or recessive allele. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Cc x Bb \u2192 25% CcBb, 50% CcBb (wait, no\u2014correct approach is to combine the two genes separately. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% * 25% = 6.25%)\n- CC Bb (6.25%)\n- cc BB (6.25%)\n- cc Bb (6.25%)\n\nMapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- cc BB: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype F\n- cc Bb: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nSince each phenotype accounts for 6.25% of the F2 population, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 6.25% each, but since the options are in whole numbers, rounding gives 4:4:4:4, which matches option K.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in both traits being expressed. So in this case, every bird in the F2 generation would have pigment red and brown, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, but that contradicts the given options. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation without considering dominance beyond what's given. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual phenotypic ratios based on the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nWait, looking back, the options don't include 100% for any phenotype. The highest option is H with 5 checkered red, 3 brown red, 2 red brown, and 6 brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me approach this differently. Since both genes determine coat color, and the F2 generation consists of 16 possible combinations, each with a certain probability. The phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Phenotype A: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this would imply 100%, which isn't possible)\n- Similarly, Phenotype B: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype C: P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype D: P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis can't be right because it suggests that all birds would have both traits, which isn't realistic. Instead, I must be missing something. Perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome. Wait, in this case, both genes are acting independently. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. Therefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will have the respective trait. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C): Always true unless both c alleles are present.\n- Brown (B): Always true unless both b alleles are present.\n\nSo the only way a bird won't have both traits is if it has neither C nor B alleles. Which would require both c and b alleles. But since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the chance of having neither C nor B is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, and similarly for neither B nor b. So the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and brown (has at least one C and one B)\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and checkered (has at least one C but lacks B)\nPhenotype C: Plain and brown (lacks C but has B)\nPhenotype D: Plain and checkered (lacks both)\n\nThe probability for each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 - (probability of neither C nor B) = 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16? Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the probability that a bird has at least one C allele is 3/4 (since only 1/4 has both c alleles). Similarly, the probability of having at least one B allele is also 3/4. Therefore, the probability that a bird has both traits (A) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which again seems off. This suggests that all birds would have both traits, which contradicts the standard genetics where both traits are expressed if any dominant allele is present. So perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations rather than probabilities.\n\nGiven that, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes from a dihybrid cross (parental genotypes: CC BB and cc bb):\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- Cc (for C)\n- Bb (for B)\n\nThus, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (prob: 25%)\n2. CC Bb (prob: 25%)\n3. cc BB (prob: 25%)\n4. cc Bb (prob: 25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor B locus (body color):\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype E\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype E\n3. cc BB: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype F\n4. cc Bb: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nWait, but according to the given options, none of them mention Phenotype E and F as separate. Looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. All equal\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nL. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\n\nWait, looking at option K: 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. That seems logical because for the C locus, half the population is red (including checkered), and for the B locus, half the population is brown (including checkered). Therefore, the combinations would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Cc, Bb): (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc, Bb): same, 6.25%\n- Plain red (cc, Bb): 6.25%\n- Plain brown (Cc, bb): 6.25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 25% each, totaling 100%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 6.25% each, but since the options use whole numbers, perhaps they round to 4:4:4:4, which totals 16 parts, but the sum doesn't match 100%. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in terms of counts, ignoring percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait for each gene. For example, if pigment color is considered, regardless of body color. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective trait, leading to all birds having both traits, resulting in a 100% checkered-red and 100% checkered-brown, which isn't matching the options. \n\nWait, looking back at the options, option K says 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. Adding those up gives 16, which might represent 100% across 16 birds. Each category represents 25% of the population, so 4 out of 16 equals 25%. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, or simplified, 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none directly say that. Option K is the closest, but it's phrased as \"4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown.\" So that would correspond to 4 each, totaling 16, representing 25% each. Therefore, the answer might be option K, but I'm a bit confused because my initial thought was that all birds would have both traits, but perhaps the question is intended to assume that each bird has a 50% chance for each trait, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing it properly. The F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but actually, each parent produces gametes with either the dominant or recessive allele. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, which produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n2. Cc x Bb \u2192 25% CcBb, 50% CcBb (wait, no\u2014correct approach is to combine the two genes separately. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% * 25% = 6.25%)\n- CC Bb (6.25%)\n- cc BB (6.25%)\n- cc Bb (6.25%)\n\nMapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- cc BB: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype F\n- cc Bb: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nSince each phenotype accounts for 6.25% of the F2 population, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 6.25% each, but since the options are in whole numbers, rounding gives 4:4:4:4, which matches option K.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "rollout": " So all birds will have both traits because C is always dominant and B is always dominant in this case.

The first parent is CC BB, which means both C and B are dominant. The second parent is cc bb, which means both c and b are recessive. So when they mate, all the offspring must inherit one allele from each parent. Therefore, the F1 will all be CcBb, meaning both C and B are dominant. Thus, all F1 birds will express both traits: red pigment and brown body. Therefore, all F1 and F2 birds will have both traits, resulting in only one phenotype for each genotype. Wait, but then how come the options given include different ratios?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each combination of traits. Since all F2 individuals will have both traits, regardless of their genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for the phenotype that includes both traits. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect a 100% ratio. Perhaps I've misinterpreted something. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014is the checkered red bird a homozygous recessive (cc) and the plain brown bird a homozygous dominant (BB)? No, wait\u2014the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow standard dihybrid patterns. But the key point is that all F2 individuals will express both traits because C and B are dominant. So the phenotypic ratio would be all showing both traits, leading to one phenotype. But the options don't support that; instead, they show various ratios. This suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than the F2, but the wording says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the question's description. Let me reread the entire problem statement to ensure accuracy. Oh! Wait\u2014I think I see the issue. The problem mentions a dihybrid cross but doesn't specify whether it's a test cross or a selfing. The user initially described the cross as a dihybrid cross, but then wrote that the parents are a homozygous checkered red and a plain brown bird, implying that the checkered red bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain brown bird is homozygous dominant (BB). Wait, that makes sense. Because CC BB is homozygous dominant for both traits, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would have the standard dihybrid ratios.\n\nNow, regarding the phenotypic ratios, typically, in a dihybrid cross, we get four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both dominant traits: C and B\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: C and b\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: c and B\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: c and b\n\nEach of these would correspond to specific phenotypes. Assuming that:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown (C and B dominant): Phenotype X\n- Pigmented red and checkered (C and B recessive): Phenotype Y\n- Plain red and brown (c and B dominant): Phenotype Z\n- Plain red and checkered (c and B recessive): Phenotype W\n\nThen, under normal circumstances, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, totaling 16. However, looking at the answer choices provided, most do not reflect this exact ratio. Instead, they seem to focus on specific combinations without accounting for all four phenotypes. Perhaps the problem is asking about the ratio within a subset of phenotypes, such as those with checkered or plain colors, ignoring the pigment color. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on the checkered or plain aspects, excluding the pigment color.\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So if we consider only the checkered and plain traits, ignoring pigment color, the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1 for the checkered (c) and plain (C) traits, giving 9+3+3+1=16. But why would the pigment color matter? Maybe the question is focusing on the coat color aspect, while pigment color isn't directly relevant to the coat color expression. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the coat color phenotypes among the checkered and plain, leading to a 9:3:3:1 distribution among the four coat color classes.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't match exactly this, except for option D, which seems to align with the 9:3:3:1 distribution across the four coat color classes. But the way the question is phrased, it asks for the phenotypic ratio considering both checkered and plain, along with pigmented red and brown. But if pigment color isn't expressed in the F2 due to dominance, then the phenotypic ratio would only include checkered and plain, making it 9:3:3:1, but presented as 1 (checkered red) :3 (checkered brown) :9 (plain red) :3 (plain brown), summing to 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio would be 1:3:9:3, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, adding up to 16. Looking at the options, option D matches this structure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So all birds will have both traits because C is always dominant and B is always dominant in this case. Wait, but that contradicts the typical dihybrid crosses where multiple phenotypes emerge. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are both homozygous. The first parent is CC BB, which means both C and B are dominant. The second parent is cc bb, which means both c and b are recessive. So when they mate, all the offspring must inherit one allele from each parent. Therefore, the F1 will all be CcBb, meaning both C and B are dominant. Thus, all F1 birds will express both traits: red pigment and brown body. Therefore, all F1 and F2 birds will have both traits, resulting in only one phenotype for each genotype. Wait, but then how come the options given include different ratios?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each combination of traits. Since all F2 individuals will have both traits, regardless of their genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for the phenotype that includes both traits. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect a 100% ratio. Perhaps I've misinterpreted something. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014is the checkered red bird a homozygous recessive (cc) and the plain brown bird a homozygous dominant (BB)? No, wait\u2014the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both genes. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow standard dihybrid patterns. But the key point is that all F2 individuals will express both traits because C and B are dominant. So the phenotypic ratio would be all showing both traits, leading to one phenotype. But the options don't support that; instead, they show various ratios. This suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than the F2, but the wording says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the question's description. Let me reread the entire problem statement to ensure accuracy. Oh! Wait\u2014I think I see the issue. The problem mentions a dihybrid cross but doesn't specify whether it's a test cross or a selfing. The user initially described the cross as a dihybrid cross, but then wrote that the parents are a homozygous checkered red and a plain brown bird, implying that the checkered red bird is homozygous recessive (cc), and the plain brown bird is homozygous dominant (BB). Wait, that makes sense. Because CC BB is homozygous dominant for both traits, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would have the standard dihybrid ratios.\n\nNow, regarding the phenotypic ratios, typically, in a dihybrid cross, we get four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both dominant traits: C and B\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: C and b\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: c and B\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: c and b\n\nEach of these would correspond to specific phenotypes. Assuming that:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown (C and B dominant): Phenotype X\n- Pigmented red and checkered (C and B recessive): Phenotype Y\n- Plain red and brown (c and B dominant): Phenotype Z\n- Plain red and checkered (c and B recessive): Phenotype W\n\nThen, under normal circumstances, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, totaling 16. However, looking at the answer choices provided, most do not reflect this exact ratio. Instead, they seem to focus on specific combinations without accounting for all four phenotypes. Perhaps the problem is asking about the ratio within a subset of phenotypes, such as those with checkered or plain colors, ignoring the pigment color. Alternatively, maybe the question is focusing only on the checkered or plain aspects, excluding the pigment color.\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So if we consider only the checkered and plain traits, ignoring pigment color, the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1 for the checkered (c) and plain (C) traits, giving 9+3+3+1=16. But why would the pigment color matter? Maybe the question is focusing on the coat color aspect, while pigment color isn't directly relevant to the coat color expression. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the coat color phenotypes among the checkered and plain, leading to a 9:3:3:1 distribution among the four coat color classes.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't match exactly this, except for option D, which seems to align with the 9:3:3:1 distribution across the four coat color classes. But the way the question is phrased, it asks for the phenotypic ratio considering both checkered and plain, along with pigmented red and brown. But if pigment color isn't expressed in the F2 due to dominance, then the phenotypic ratio would only include checkered and plain, making it 9:3:3:1, but presented as 1 (checkered red) :3 (checkered brown) :9 (plain red) :3 (plain brown), summing to 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio would be 1:3:9:3, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, adding up to 16. Looking at the options, option D matches this structure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait.",

So for pigment color, the probability of being red (C) is 1, and plain (c) is 0. Similarly, for body color, brown (B) is 1, checkered (b) is 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1.

Plain and checkered (c and b): P(c)*P(b) = 0*0 = 0\n\nWait, that suggests that all birds in this scenario will have both traits expressed, which isn't realistic. I must have made a mistake here. Let me reconsider. Oh, no\u2014I think I misapplied the probabilities. Each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes. Let's approach it differently.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only give cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2. Therefore, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 will consist of:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%).\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C is dominant) and body brown (B is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant) and body checkered (b is recessive)\n- cc: Plain color (c is dominant) and body brown (b is recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (25%)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (50%)\n3. Plain and brown (25%)\n4. Plain and checkered (0%)\n\nWait, that seems off because adding up to 100%, it's 25%+50%+25%=100%, but the options don't include 100%, so perhaps my mapping is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the actual number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, considering how many of each genotype survive. But in this case, all birds are alive, so survival rate is 100%. Therefore, the F2 population consists solely of the four genotypes with the given probabilities.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: 50%\n- Plain and brown: 25%\n- Plain and checkered: 0%\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 13, which is more than 100%, so that can't be right.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also sums to 16.\n\nHmm, none of them seem to add up to 100%. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy properly. The problem states that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So in terms of coat color, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment will have red or brown, depending on the other gene.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nFor pigment color:\n\n- C: red\n- c: plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B: brown\n- b: checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nSince all birds are present in F2, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the probability of each combination.\n\nFrom F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain and brown\n\nBecause in the F2 generation, only the cc genotype results in the Plain and checkered phenotype (since c is recessive and b is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Pigment red and brown, 50% Pigment red and checkered, 25% Plain and brown.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total\n\nOption F: 4 each \u2192 16\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nNone of the options sum to 100%, which suggests I might have misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts, not percentages. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, the options are labeled from A to J, each providing a specific count for each phenotype. Let's see what each option represents:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to recalculate the expected numbers instead of percentages. Let's assume that the F2 generation has a certain number of each genotype, and then determine how many of those express each phenotype.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- CC (25%): 25 birds \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%): 50 birds \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%): 25 birds \u2192 Plain and brown\n\nNow, translating these into counts:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 50 birds\n- Plain and brown: 25 birds\n- Plain and checkered: 0 birds\n\nAdding these up: 25+50+25=100, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these counts to the options presented:\n\nLooking at Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16, which doesn't match our 100.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16, still less than 100.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12, too low.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and just count the number of each genotype, leading to 25% each for the four phenotypes. In that case, in 100 birds:\n\n- 25 Pigment red and brown\n- 25 Pigment red and checkered\n- 25 Plain and brown\n- 25 Plain and checkered\n\nWhich would correspond to option D: 1,3,9,3 scaled down to 16, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if we take the counts as 25 each, but the options don't reflect that exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the dominance hierarchy directly without considering the probabilities, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. So for example:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant: Pigment red and brown\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant: Plain and brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each trait are independent. So for pigment color, the probability of being red (C) is 1, and plain (c) is 0. Similarly, for body color, brown (B) is 1, checkered (b) is 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): P(C)*P(b) = 1*0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): P(c)*P(B) = 0*1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b): P(c)*P(b) = 0*0 = 0\n\nWait, that suggests that all birds in this scenario will have both traits expressed, which isn't realistic. I must have made a mistake here. Let me reconsider. Oh, no\u2014I think I misapplied the probabilities. Each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes. Let's approach it differently.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only give cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2. Therefore, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 will consist of:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (50%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%).\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C is dominant) and body brown (B is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (C dominant) and body checkered (b is recessive)\n- cc: Plain color (c is dominant) and body brown (b is recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (25%)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (50%)\n3. Plain and brown (25%)\n4. Plain and checkered (0%)\n\nWait, that seems off because adding up to 100%, it's 25%+50%+25%=100%, but the options don't include 100%, so perhaps my mapping is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the actual number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, considering how many of each genotype survive. But in this case, all birds are alive, so survival rate is 100%. Therefore, the F2 population consists solely of the four genotypes with the given probabilities.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: 50%\n- Plain and brown: 25%\n- Plain and checkered: 0%\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 13, which is more than 100%, so that can't be right.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also sums to 16.\n\nHmm, none of them seem to add up to 100%. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy properly. The problem states that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So in terms of coat color, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment will have red or brown, depending on the other gene.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nFor pigment color:\n\n- C: red\n- c: plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B: brown\n- b: checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nSince all birds are present in F2, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the probability of each combination.\n\nFrom F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain and brown\n\nBecause in the F2 generation, only the cc genotype results in the Plain and checkered phenotype (since c is recessive and b is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% Pigment red and brown, 50% Pigment red and checkered, 25% Plain and brown.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total\n\nOption F: 4 each \u2192 16\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nNone of the options sum to 100%, which suggests I might have misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts, not percentages. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, the options are labeled from A to J, each providing a specific count for each phenotype. Let's see what each option represents:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 16\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to recalculate the expected numbers instead of percentages. Let's assume that the F2 generation has a certain number of each genotype, and then determine how many of those express each phenotype.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- CC (25%): 25 birds \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- Cc (50%): 50 birds \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- cc (25%): 25 birds \u2192 Plain and brown\n\nNow, translating these into counts:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 50 birds\n- Plain and brown: 25 birds\n- Plain and checkered: 0 birds\n\nAdding these up: 25+50+25=100, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these counts to the options presented:\n\nLooking at Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16, which doesn't match our 100.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16, still less than 100.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, same issue.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12, too low.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16, same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and just count the number of each genotype, leading to 25% each for the four phenotypes. In that case, in 100 birds:\n\n- 25 Pigment red and brown\n- 25 Pigment red and checkered\n- 25 Plain and brown\n- 25 Plain and checkered\n\nWhich would correspond to option D: 1,3,9,3 scaled down to 16, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if we take the counts as 25 each, but the options don't reflect that exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the dominance hierarchy directly without considering the probabilities, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and the F2 generation will have a 2:2 ratio between the dominant and recessive phenotypes for each trait, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio overall. But the options suggest different distributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: 5,3,2,6. Which adds to 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

    "rollout": " So, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is indeed 100%, meaning all F2 birds will be either red-brown or whatever else. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, let's go back.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is due to gene C, and the plain color is due to gene B. Wait, but the initial description said: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I got the letters mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, C controls the checkered pattern (so it's dominant), and B controls red color (so it's dominant). The recessives are c and b, respectively. So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the desired color. So, for example, a bird with CB would have both C (checkered) and B (red), resulting in a red checkered bird. A bird with cb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), resulting in a plain checkered bird. Similarly, a bird with BB would have red pigment regardless of the pattern, and a bird with cc would have plain regardless of the pattern.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Each gene contributes to the final phenotype. So, the F2 generation will have various combinations based on the segregation of alleles from each parent.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 generation. Each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Parent 1: CC (all C)\n- Parent 2: cc (all c)\nEach parent contributes either C or c. Since Parent 1 is CC, they'll always pass C. Parent 2 is cc, so they'll always pass c. Thus, all F2 offspring will have Cc for the pattern.\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Parent 1: BB (all B)\n- Parent 2: bb (all b)\nEach parent contributes either B or b. Parent 1 passes B, Parent 2 passes b. So all F2 offspring will be Bb.\n\nTherefore, every F2 bird will have the genotype CcBb.\n\nNow, what are the phenotypes?\n\nSince both genes are under dominant control:\n\n- For the pattern: C is dominant, so all Cc individuals will have the checkered pattern.\n- For the color: B is dominant, so all Bb individuals will have red color.\n\nThus, every F2 bird will have both the checkered pattern and red color, making them red checkered birds.\n\nTherefore, the entire F2 generation will be red checkered birds, with no variation among them.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't align with our conclusion. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also doesn't fit. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Still not matching. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Close but not exactly. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Not matching.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, all F2 birds are red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. Looking at the options, none seem to reflect that exactly. The closest is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that's a 9:3:3:1 ratio, implying three traits. However, in reality, there's only two phenotypes here, both being red checkered. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, none match perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem. The parents are CCBB (homozgyoous dominant) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfed to get F2. As I thought before, F2 will all be CcBb. So all F2 birds will be red checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them say 'all red checkered.' However, option H is: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. None of these suggest all red. Perhaps I misread the question regarding the loci. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I misassigned the genes. The problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c).\n- Red color (B) is dominant over brown (b).\n\nSo, in terms of coat color, the presence of B results in red, and the presence of b results in brown. For the pattern, C results in checkered, and c results in plain.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation will have all Cc (checkered) and Bb (red). So all F2 birds will be red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, and no others. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, which has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting multiple phenotypes. But in this case, there are only two phenotypes: red checkered and plain checkered, but plain color itself also affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014all F2 birds are red checkered, because they have B (Bb) and C (Cc). So their phenotype is red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, but the options don't include that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the genotypes. Let me consider that the parents might not be as I assumed. Wait, the first parent is CCBB, which is CC BB\u2014so both alleles are dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, so both alleles are recessive. So F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce F2 with all CcBb, as each gene segregates completely.\n\nIn any case, all F2 birds are CcBb, which results in red checkered. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the question specifies F2. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied dominance. Let me confirm:\n\nIf a bird is CcBb, then:\n\n- For C (pattern): C is dominant, so checkered (C)\n- For B (color): B is dominant, so red (B)\nThus, all F2 birds have red checkered, so the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. But again, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, but that has four phenotypes, whereas we only have two.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the problem. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now I'm confused. The checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant. The plain color is determined by c, recessive. Red color is determined by B, dominant. Brown by b, recessive. So, for the pattern, C is dominant over c. For color, B is dominant over b.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant B allele. For a bird to be checkered, it must have at least one dominant C allele. So, the presence of either dominant allele in either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nThus, in F2, all F2 individuals will be CcBb. So, their phenotype is red checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But since that's not an option, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about a different aspect, such as the F1 generation, but the question specifically mentions F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the genotypes. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. \n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All C and B alleles (so can only give CB)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All c and b alleles (can only give cb)\n\nWhen crossing CC BB (which is CC BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 would be:\n\n- From CC BB: CB\n- From cc bb: cb\nSo F1 genotype is CB and cb, resulting in CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfing (crossing CcBb x CcBb) would produce the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- (C/C) x (C/C) = CC\n- (C/C) x (c/c) = Cc\n- (c/c) x (C/C) = cC\n- (c/c) x (c/c) = cc\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- (B/B) x (B/B) = BB\n- (B/B) x (b/b) = Bb\n- (b/b) x (B/B) = bB\n- (b/b) x (b/b) = bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cB BB\n- 25% cB Bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus: 100% C (from Parent 1) and 50% c (from Parent 2). So the F1 has 100% C and 50% c. When F1 crosses with F1, each gene segregates as follows:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- 50% C (from F1) x 50% C \u2192 25% CC\n- 50% C x 50% c \u2192 25% Cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 50% B (from F1) x 50% B \u2192 25% BB\n- 50% B x 50% b \u2192 25% Bb\n\nAnd then combining both loci, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent can only contribute one allele for each gene. So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from C and C)\n- 25% Cc (from C and c)\n- 25% cc (from c and c)\n- And similarly for B:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut combining them, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations, leading to 16 possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance.\n\nHowever, when considering dominance, certain genotypes will produce the same phenotype. For example:\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered (dominant C)\n- Cc \u2192 checkered (dominant C)\n- cc \u2192 plain (recessive c)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- bb \u2192 plain (recessive b)\n\nSo, for each gene, the presence of dominant alleles results in the corresponding phenotype. Thus, in F2:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C (CC, Cc, Cc) \u2192 checkered pattern\n- Any bird with at least one dominant B (BB, Bb, Bb) \u2192 brown color\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations where both conditions are met. Therefore:\n\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 red checkered\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and no dominant B \u2192 plain checkered\n- All birds with no dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 brown checkered\n- All birds with neither dominant C nor B \u2192 plain pattern\n\nBut in our case, since F2 is CcBb, which means:\n\n- C locus: C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- B locus: B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nSo all F2 birds will have both dominant C and B alleles, resulting in red checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But this is inconsistent with our calculation, which shows only red checkered. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me verify:\n\nFor the pattern (C):\n- Dominant (C): checkered\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nWait, that changes things. If B is dominant, then brown is expressed unless recessive (checkered). Similarly, c is recessive, so checkered.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red, it needs to have at least one dominant B allele. For a bird to be checkered, it needs to have at least one recessive c allele.\n\nSo, in F2, all F2 birds are CcBb. So:\n\n- Pattern: C is dominant \u2192 checkered (C)\n- Color: B is dominant \u2192 brown (B)\n\nThus, all F2 birds are red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But again, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, which has four phenotypes, but we have only two.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and treat all alleles as equally contributing, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for F1 rather than F2. But the question clearly asks for F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me look back:\n\nThe parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that can't be right because CC BB would mean both alleles are dominant for both genes, while cc bb would mean both are recessive. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the parents are not as described, but the question is referring to a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParents: CC BB (genotype 1) and cc bb (genotype 2)\n\nPossible gametes from genotype 1 (CC BB):\n- Can only give CB\n\nPossible gametes from genotype 2 (cc bb):\n- Can only give cb\n\nF1: CcBb x CcBb\n\nF1 gametes:\n- From C locus: C and c\n- From B locus: B and b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are all possible combinations, including:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nThese correspond to the following phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n- CC Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc Bb: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right because all F2 birds would be red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. But again, the options don't reflect this. The closest is option C, which has four phenotypes, but that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to refer to a different scenario, such as when the parents are CC bb and cc BB. Let me see what happens in that case.\n\nParents: CC bb (parent 1) and cc BB (parent 2)\n\nParent 1 (CC bb) can only give CB gametes (C and B)\nParent 2 (cc BB) can only give cb gametes (c and B)\n\nF1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nF1 gametes:\n- From C locus: C and c\n- From B locus: B and b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc Bb",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is indeed 100%, meaning all F2 birds will be either red-brown or whatever else. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, let's go back.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is due to gene C, and the plain color is due to gene B. Wait, but the initial description said: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I got the letters mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, C controls the checkered pattern (so it's dominant), and B controls red color (so it's dominant). The recessives are c and b, respectively. So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the desired color. So, for example, a bird with CB would have both C (checkered) and B (red), resulting in a red checkered bird. A bird with cb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), resulting in a plain checkered bird. Similarly, a bird with BB would have red pigment regardless of the pattern, and a bird with cc would have plain regardless of the pattern.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Each gene contributes to the final phenotype. So, the F2 generation will have various combinations based on the segregation of alleles from each parent.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 generation. Each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Parent 1: CC (all C)\n- Parent 2: cc (all c)\nEach parent contributes either C or c. Since Parent 1 is CC, they'll always pass C. Parent 2 is cc, so they'll always pass c. Thus, all F2 offspring will have Cc for the pattern.\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Parent 1: BB (all B)\n- Parent 2: bb (all b)\nEach parent contributes either B or b. Parent 1 passes B, Parent 2 passes b. So all F2 offspring will be Bb.\n\nTherefore, every F2 bird will have the genotype CcBb.\n\nNow, what are the phenotypes?\n\nSince both genes are under dominant control:\n\n- For the pattern: C is dominant, so all Cc individuals will have the checkered pattern.\n- For the color: B is dominant, so all Bb individuals will have red color.\n\nThus, every F2 bird will have both the checkered pattern and red color, making them red checkered birds.\n\nTherefore, the entire F2 generation will be red checkered birds, with no variation among them.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't align with our conclusion. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also doesn't fit. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Still not matching. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Close but not exactly. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Not matching.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, all F2 birds are red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. Looking at the options, none seem to reflect that exactly. The closest is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that's a 9:3:3:1 ratio, implying three traits. However, in reality, there's only two phenotypes here, both being red checkered. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, none match perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem. The parents are CCBB (homozgyoous dominant) and ccbb (homozygous recessive). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfed to get F2. As I thought before, F2 will all be CcBb. So all F2 birds will be red checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them say 'all red checkered.' However, option H is: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. None of these suggest all red. Perhaps I misread the question regarding the loci. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I misassigned the genes. The problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c).\n- Red color (B) is dominant over brown (b).\n\nSo, in terms of coat color, the presence of B results in red, and the presence of b results in brown. For the pattern, C results in checkered, and c results in plain.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation will have all Cc (checkered) and Bb (red). So all F2 birds will be red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, and no others. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, which has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, suggesting multiple phenotypes. But in this case, there are only two phenotypes: red checkered and plain checkered, but plain color itself also affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014all F2 birds are red checkered, because they have B (Bb) and C (Cc). So their phenotype is red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, but the options don't include that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the genotypes. Let me consider that the parents might not be as I assumed. Wait, the first parent is CCBB, which is CC BB\u2014so both alleles are dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, so both alleles are recessive. So F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce F2 with all CcBb, as each gene segregates completely.\n\nIn any case, all F2 birds are CcBb, which results in red checkered. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the question specifies F2. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied dominance. Let me confirm:\n\nIf a bird is CcBb, then:\n\n- For C (pattern): C is dominant, so checkered (C)\n- For B (color): B is dominant, so red (B)\nThus, all F2 birds have red checkered, so the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. But again, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, but that has four phenotypes, whereas we only have two.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the problem. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now I'm confused. The checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant. The plain color is determined by c, recessive. Red color is determined by B, dominant. Brown by b, recessive. So, for the pattern, C is dominant over c. For color, B is dominant over b.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one dominant B allele. For a bird to be checkered, it must have at least one dominant C allele. So, the presence of either dominant allele in either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nThus, in F2, all F2 individuals will be CcBb. So, their phenotype is red checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But since that's not an option, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about a different aspect, such as the F1 generation, but the question specifically mentions F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the genotypes. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. \n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All C and B alleles (so can only give CB)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All c and b alleles (can only give cb)\n\nWhen crossing CC BB (which is CC BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 would be:\n\n- From CC BB: CB\n- From cc bb: cb\nSo F1 genotype is CB and cb, resulting in CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfing (crossing CcBb x CcBb) would produce the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- (C/C) x (C/C) = CC\n- (C/C) x (c/c) = Cc\n- (c/c) x (C/C) = cC\n- (c/c) x (c/c) = cc\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- (B/B) x (B/B) = BB\n- (B/B) x (b/b) = Bb\n- (b/b) x (B/B) = bB\n- (b/b) x (b/b) = bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cB BB\n- 25% cB Bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus: 100% C (from Parent 1) and 50% c (from Parent 2). So the F1 has 100% C and 50% c. When F1 crosses with F1, each gene segregates as follows:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- 50% C (from F1) x 50% C \u2192 25% CC\n- 50% C x 50% c \u2192 25% Cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 50% B (from F1) x 50% B \u2192 25% BB\n- 50% B x 50% b \u2192 25% Bb\n\nAnd then combining both loci, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent can only contribute one allele for each gene. So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from C and C)\n- 25% Cc (from C and c)\n- 25% cc (from c and c)\n- And similarly for B:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut combining them, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations, leading to 16 possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance.\n\nHowever, when considering dominance, certain genotypes will produce the same phenotype. For example:\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered (dominant C)\n- Cc \u2192 checkered (dominant C)\n- cc \u2192 plain (recessive c)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- bb \u2192 plain (recessive b)\n\nSo, for each gene, the presence of dominant alleles results in the corresponding phenotype. Thus, in F2:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C (CC, Cc, Cc) \u2192 checkered pattern\n- Any bird with at least one dominant B (BB, Bb, Bb) \u2192 brown color\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations where both conditions are met. Therefore:\n\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 red checkered\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and no dominant B \u2192 plain checkered\n- All birds with no dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 brown checkered\n- All birds with neither dominant C nor B \u2192 plain pattern\n\nBut in our case, since F2 is CcBb, which means:\n\n- C locus: C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- B locus: B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nSo all F2 birds will have both dominant C and B alleles, resulting in red checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But this is inconsistent with our calculation, which shows only red checkered. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me verify:\n\nFor the pattern (C):\n- Dominant (C): checkered\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor color (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nWait, that changes things. If B is dominant, then brown is expressed unless recessive (checkered). Similarly, c is recessive, so checkered.\n\nSo, for a bird to be red, it needs to have at least one dominant B allele. For a bird to be checkered, it needs to have at least one recessive c allele.\n\nSo, in F2, all F2 birds are CcBb. So:\n\n- Pattern: C is dominant \u2192 checkered (C)\n- Color: B is dominant \u2192 brown (B)\n\nThus, all F2 birds are red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered. But again, none of the options reflect this. The closest is option C, which has four phenotypes, but we have only two.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and treat all alleles as equally contributing, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for F1 rather than F2. But the question clearly asks for F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me look back:\n\nThe parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that can't be right because CC BB would mean both alleles are dominant for both genes, while cc bb would mean both are recessive. So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the parents are not as described, but the question is referring to a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParents: CC BB (genotype 1) and cc bb (genotype 2)\n\nPossible gametes from genotype 1 (CC BB):\n- Can only give CB\n\nPossible gametes from genotype 2 (cc bb):\n- Can only give cb\n\nF1: CcBb x CcBb\n\nF1 gametes:\n- From C locus: C and c\n- From B locus: B and b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are all possible combinations, including:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nThese correspond to the following phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n- CC Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc Bb: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right because all F2 birds would be red checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is 100% red checkered. But again, the options don't reflect this. The closest is option C, which has four phenotypes, but that's not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to refer to a different scenario, such as when the parents are CC bb and cc BB. Let me see what happens in that case.\n\nParents: CC bb (parent 1) and cc BB (parent 2)\n\nParent 1 (CC bb) can only give CB gametes (C and B)\nParent 2 (cc BB) can only give cb gametes (c and B)\n\nF1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb\n\nF1 gametes:\n- From C locus: C and c\n- From B locus: B and b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc Bb: Pattern checkered (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB: Pattern plain (c), Color brown (B) \u2192 red checkered\n- cc Bb",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, then the other trait may or may not be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, then the other trait may or may not be expressed. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Both genes must be present for both traits to be expressed. So, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (let's call this phenotype A)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered (phenotype B)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red and brown (phenotype C)\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain red and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because the presence of the dominant allele for one gene affects the overall phenotype regardless of the other. For example, if a bird has C dominant (red pigment), it will always have red color, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has B dominant (brown), it will always have brown body color. So the actual phenotypes are combinations where the presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in the corresponding traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) pigment and brown (B): Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) pigment and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c: 0 (since the bird must be C to have red pigment, but wait\u2014if the bird is Cc, does that mean it still has red pigment?) Yes, because C is dominant. So all birds with C have red pigment, regardless of the B gene.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n- Probability of B: 1 (all B)\n- Probability of b: 0 (all b)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are combinations where either or both C and B are dominant.\n\nWait, but how do the genes interact? Let me approach this differently. The probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B dominant \u2192 (1)(1) = 1 \u2192 100% chance? That seems too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the interaction. Perhaps both genes are needed for the trait to be expressed. Let me consider that. In reality, a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to manifest. So:\n\n- To have red pigment, the bird must have at least one C allele.\n- To have brown body color, the bird must have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. Has C and not B \u2192 Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n3. Has not C and B \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each:\n\n- Phenotype A: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype B: (Probability of C) * (Probability of not B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype C: (Probability of not C) * (Probability of B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype D: (Probability of not C) * (Probability of not B) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis can't be right because all birds in this scenario must have at least one dominant allele for both traits, which isn't true. For example, a bird could have CcBB, which has red pigment and brown body, but also a bird like Ccbb, which has red pigment and checkered body. Or a bird like ccBB, which has plain pigment and brown body. And finally, a bird like ccbb, which has plain pigment and checkered body.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations above, Phenotype A has a 100% chance, which contradicts the fact that some birds don't have dominant alleles for both genes. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me re-express the problem. Each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to display the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): if the bird has at least one C, it'll have red pigment.\n- For body color (B): if the bird has at least one B, it'll have brown body.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. not C and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. not C and not B \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C * B = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 2: C * not B = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype 3: not C * B = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype 4: not C * not B = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThat can't be right because it suggests that all birds have at least one dominant allele for both traits, which isn't necessarily the case. Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has C but not B, it still has red pigment, so Phenotype 2 is Red and Checkered. Similarly, a bird with not C and B is Plain and Brown, and not C and not B is Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo the probabilities are indeed:\n\nPhenotype A: 100%\nPhenotype B: 0%\nPhenotype C: 0%\nPhenotype D: 0%\n\nWhich would imply that all birds have both traits expressed, which isn't realistic. This suggests that my initial approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits.\n- If it has at least one C and none B, it will have only the red pigment trait.\n- If it has none C and at least one B, it will have only the brown body trait.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it will have neither trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the number of possible genotypes and their likelihoods. Since the genes are independent, each combination of alleles occurs with a certain probability.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (probability 25%): Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. Cc (probability 50%): Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n3. cC (same as Cc) \u2192 same as above\n4. cc (probability 25%): Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach counts the same genotype twice, leading to confusion. Instead, the correct way is to consider each possible combination of alleles for each gene separately.\n\nGene C (pale vs. red):\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nGene B (brown vs. checkered):\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each genotype (for C and B) has a probability equal to the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, grouping these into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype A (C dominant and B dominant): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 Total probability: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 37.5%\n\nPhenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype C (C recessive, B dominant): Cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 12.5% + 12.5% = 25%\n\nPhenotype D (C recessive, B recessive): cc bb \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 37.5% + 18.75% + 25% + 6.25% = 87.5%, which exceeds 100%. That indicates an error in calculation. Let me recalculate the groupings properly.\n\nCorrect grouping:\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C is present (i.e., CC, Cc) AND B is present (i.e., BB, Bb). So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 sum = 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 37.5%\n\nPhenotype B: Genotypes where C is present BUT B is absent (i.e., bb). So, CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype C: Genotypes where C is absent BUT B is present (i.e., Bb). So, Cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 12.5 + 12.5 = 25%\n\nPhenotype D: Genotypes where both C and B are absent (i.e., cc bb) \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 37.5 + 18.75 + 25 + 6.25 = 87.5% \u2192 This still doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in the method. It's clear that simply adding probabilities without considering overlapping cases is causing issues. Instead, it's better to count the number of favorable outcomes over total possibilities.\n\nEach bird has four alleles: two for C and two for B. For each gene, the number of possible combinations is 4 (AA, Aa, aa). Since the genes are independent, the total number of possible genotypes is 4 (for C) * 4 (for B) = 16. But in reality, due to dominance, some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. However, for simplicity, we can calculate the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype A: C present AND B present \u2192 Number of such genotypes = (number of C present genotypes) * (number of B present genotypes). \n\nNumber of C present genotypes: For gene C, any C allele (so in terms of alleles, if we consider each C as contributing to presence, it's 3/4 of the time). Similarly for B. But instead, considering all possible genotypes:\n\nTotal genotypes for C: 4 (CC, Cc, cC, cc) \u2192 4 possibilities. Wait, actually, for a diploid organism, each gene has 3 possible genotypes: AA, Aa, aa. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since only aa is recessive).\n\nWait, but for our purposes, we can calculate the number of favorable genotypes:\n\nPhenotype A requires at least one C and at least one B. So, the number of favorable genotypes is the number of genotypes where C is present and B is present.\n\nTo calculate this, we can subtract the unfavorable cases (where C is missing OR B is missing) from the total.\n\nTotal possible genotypes for C: 4 (but considering all alleles together, perhaps it's easier to look at all possible combinations across both genes.)\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately, the total number of possible combinations is 4 (for C) * 4 (for B) = 16. Each combination represents a unique genotype.\n\nNow, let's enumerate the genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, now this approach lists all 16 possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype. From this, we can count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Only CC BB \u2192 1\nPhenotype B: CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 2\nPhenotype C: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nPhenotype D: Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \u2192 8 out of 16, so 50%.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations gave different percentages. It seems I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nActually, each bird has four alleles: two for C and two for B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- C: CC (prob 25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhen combining these, each bird has a genotype for C and a genotype for B. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we can create a table:\n\n| Phenotype | Frequency |\n|------------|-----------|\n| A          | ?         |\n| B          | ?         |\n| C          | ?         |\n| D          | ?         |\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. **Phenotype A (C present and B present)**:\n   - C present: Any genotype where at least one C.\n     - Cc and cc for C.\n   - B present: Any genotype where at least one B.\n     - Bb and bb for B.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where both C and B are present.\n     - These are:\n       - CC BB\n       - CC Bb\n       - Cc BB\n       - Cc Bb\n     - Total: 4 genotypes.\n\n2. **Phenotype B (C present and B absent)**:\n   - C present: As above.\n   - B absent: bb.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where C is present and B is absent.\n     - CC bb\n     - Cc bb\n     - Total: 2 genotypes.\n\n3. **Phenotype C (C absent and B present)**:\n   - C absent: cc.\n   - B present: Bb.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where C is absent and B is present.\n     - cc BB\n     - cc Bb\n     - Total: 2 genotypes.\n\n4. **Phenotype D (Both C and B absent)**:\n   - C absent: cc.\n   - B absent: bb.\n   - Intersection: cc bb.\n   - Total: 1 genotype.\n\nNow, summing these up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. Wait, that's 9 out of 16, which is 56.25%. But this contradicts previous calculations. I think I messed up the counting. Let's try another approach.\n\nInstead of listing all 16 genotypes, let's use probabilities. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for C is 3/4 (since only aa is recessive, and the probability of aa is 1/4). Similarly, for B, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the probability of both events happening is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16, which is approximately 56.25%. But this doesn't align with the earlier detailed count. I think I'm making a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the presence of dominant alleles translates to the phenotype. In reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will have both traits expressed. However, if it has only one dominant allele for one trait and the other is recessive, it won't express that trait. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both red and brown coloration.\n- If it has at least one C and no B, it will have red and plain.\n- If it has no C but at least one B, it will have plain and brown.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it will have plain and plain.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the probabilities correctly.\n\nProbability of having at least one C: 3/4 (since the probability of cc is 1/4)\nProbability of having at least one B: 3/4\n\nAssuming independence, the probability of having both traits expressed (i.e., having at least one C and at least one B) is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%.\n\nIf only one of the traits is expressed, the probability is lower. However, calculating the exact distribution of each phenotype requires considering all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the possible phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C and not B): ?\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, for the given cross, we can directly determine the phenotypic ratio.\n\nGiven the parents: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, then the other trait may or may not be expressed. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Both genes must be present for both traits to be expressed. So, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (let's call this phenotype A)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered (phenotype B)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red and brown (phenotype C)\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain red and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because the presence of the dominant allele for one gene affects the overall phenotype regardless of the other. For example, if a bird has C dominant (red pigment), it will always have red color, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has B dominant (brown), it will always have brown body color. So the actual phenotypes are combinations where the presence of dominant alleles for each gene results in the corresponding traits.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) pigment and brown (B): Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) pigment and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c: 0 (since the bird must be C to have red pigment, but wait\u2014if the bird is Cc, does that mean it still has red pigment?) Yes, because C is dominant. So all birds with C have red pigment, regardless of the B gene.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n- Probability of B: 1 (all B)\n- Probability of b: 0 (all b)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are combinations where either or both C and B are dominant.\n\nWait, but how do the genes interact? Let me approach this differently. The probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C and B dominant \u2192 (1)(1) = 1 \u2192 100% chance? That seems too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the interaction. Perhaps both genes are needed for the trait to be expressed. Let me consider that. In reality, a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to manifest. So:\n\n- To have red pigment, the bird must have at least one C allele.\n- To have brown body color, the bird must have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. Has C and not B \u2192 Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n3. Has not C and B \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each:\n\n- Phenotype A: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype B: (Probability of C) * (Probability of not B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype C: (Probability of not C) * (Probability of B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype D: (Probability of not C) * (Probability of not B) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis can't be right because all birds in this scenario must have at least one dominant allele for both traits, which isn't true. For example, a bird could have CcBB, which has red pigment and brown body, but also a bird like Ccbb, which has red pigment and checkered body. Or a bird like ccBB, which has plain pigment and brown body. And finally, a bird like ccbb, which has plain pigment and checkered body.\n\nWait, but according to the calculations above, Phenotype A has a 100% chance, which contradicts the fact that some birds don't have dominant alleles for both genes. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me re-express the problem. Each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to display the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): if the bird has at least one C, it'll have red pigment.\n- For body color (B): if the bird has at least one B, it'll have brown body.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and not B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. not C and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. not C and not B \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C * B = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 2: C * not B = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype 3: not C * B = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Phenotype 4: not C * not B = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThat can't be right because it suggests that all birds have at least one dominant allele for both traits, which isn't necessarily the case. Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has C but not B, it still has red pigment, so Phenotype 2 is Red and Checkered. Similarly, a bird with not C and B is Plain and Brown, and not C and not B is Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo the probabilities are indeed:\n\nPhenotype A: 100%\nPhenotype B: 0%\nPhenotype C: 0%\nPhenotype D: 0%\n\nWhich would imply that all birds have both traits expressed, which isn't realistic. This suggests that my initial approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, regardless of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits.\n- If it has at least one C and none B, it will have only the red pigment trait.\n- If it has none C and at least one B, it will have only the brown body trait.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it will have neither trait.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the number of possible genotypes and their likelihoods. Since the genes are independent, each combination of alleles occurs with a certain probability.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (probability 25%): Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n2. Cc (probability 50%): Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n3. cC (same as Cc) \u2192 same as above\n4. cc (probability 25%): Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach counts the same genotype twice, leading to confusion. Instead, the correct way is to consider each possible combination of alleles for each gene separately.\n\nGene C (pale vs. red):\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nGene B (brown vs. checkered):\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So each genotype (for C and B) has a probability equal to the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, grouping these into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype A (C dominant and B dominant): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 Total probability: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 37.5%\n\nPhenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype C (C recessive, B dominant): Cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 12.5% + 12.5% = 25%\n\nPhenotype D (C recessive, B recessive): cc bb \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 37.5% + 18.75% + 25% + 6.25% = 87.5%, which exceeds 100%. That indicates an error in calculation. Let me recalculate the groupings properly.\n\nCorrect grouping:\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C is present (i.e., CC, Cc) AND B is present (i.e., BB, Bb). So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 sum = 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 37.5%\n\nPhenotype B: Genotypes where C is present BUT B is absent (i.e., bb). So, CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype C: Genotypes where C is absent BUT B is present (i.e., Bb). So, Cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 12.5 + 12.5 = 25%\n\nPhenotype D: Genotypes where both C and B are absent (i.e., cc bb) \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 37.5 + 18.75 + 25 + 6.25 = 87.5% \u2192 This still doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in the method. It's clear that simply adding probabilities without considering overlapping cases is causing issues. Instead, it's better to count the number of favorable outcomes over total possibilities.\n\nEach bird has four alleles: two for C and two for B. For each gene, the number of possible combinations is 4 (AA, Aa, aa). Since the genes are independent, the total number of possible genotypes is 4 (for C) * 4 (for B) = 16. But in reality, due to dominance, some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. However, for simplicity, we can calculate the number of genotypes that result in each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype A: C present AND B present \u2192 Number of such genotypes = (number of C present genotypes) * (number of B present genotypes). \n\nNumber of C present genotypes: For gene C, any C allele (so in terms of alleles, if we consider each C as contributing to presence, it's 3/4 of the time). Similarly for B. But instead, considering all possible genotypes:\n\nTotal genotypes for C: 4 (CC, Cc, cC, cc) \u2192 4 possibilities. Wait, actually, for a diploid organism, each gene has 3 possible genotypes: AA, Aa, aa. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since only aa is recessive).\n\nWait, but for our purposes, we can calculate the number of favorable genotypes:\n\nPhenotype A requires at least one C and at least one B. So, the number of favorable genotypes is the number of genotypes where C is present and B is present.\n\nTo calculate this, we can subtract the unfavorable cases (where C is missing OR B is missing) from the total.\n\nTotal possible genotypes for C: 4 (but considering all alleles together, perhaps it's easier to look at all possible combinations across both genes.)\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately, the total number of possible combinations is 4 (for C) * 4 (for B) = 16. Each combination represents a unique genotype.\n\nNow, let's enumerate the genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, now this approach lists all 16 possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype. From this, we can count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Only CC BB \u2192 1\nPhenotype B: CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 2\nPhenotype C: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nPhenotype D: Cc Bb, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \u2192 8 out of 16, so 50%.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations gave different percentages. It seems I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nActually, each bird has four alleles: two for C and two for B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- C: CC (prob 25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhen combining these, each bird has a genotype for C and a genotype for B. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we can create a table:\n\n| Phenotype | Frequency |\n|------------|-----------|\n| A          | ?         |\n| B          | ?         |\n| C          | ?         |\n| D          | ?         |\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. **Phenotype A (C present and B present)**:\n   - C present: Any genotype where at least one C.\n     - Cc and cc for C.\n   - B present: Any genotype where at least one B.\n     - Bb and bb for B.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where both C and B are present.\n     - These are:\n       - CC BB\n       - CC Bb\n       - Cc BB\n       - Cc Bb\n     - Total: 4 genotypes.\n\n2. **Phenotype B (C present and B absent)**:\n   - C present: As above.\n   - B absent: bb.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where C is present and B is absent.\n     - CC bb\n     - Cc bb\n     - Total: 2 genotypes.\n\n3. **Phenotype C (C absent and B present)**:\n   - C absent: cc.\n   - B present: Bb.\n   - Intersection: Genotypes where C is absent and B is present.\n     - cc BB\n     - cc Bb\n     - Total: 2 genotypes.\n\n4. **Phenotype D (Both C and B absent)**:\n   - C absent: cc.\n   - B absent: bb.\n   - Intersection: cc bb.\n   - Total: 1 genotype.\n\nNow, summing these up: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. Wait, that's 9 out of 16, which is 56.25%. But this contradicts previous calculations. I think I messed up the counting. Let's try another approach.\n\nInstead of listing all 16 genotypes, let's use probabilities. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for C is 3/4 (since only aa is recessive, and the probability of aa is 1/4). Similarly, for B, the probability of at least one dominant allele is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the probability of both events happening is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16, which is approximately 56.25%. But this doesn't align with the earlier detailed count. I think I'm making a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the presence of dominant alleles translates to the phenotype. In reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will have both traits expressed. However, if it has only one dominant allele for one trait and the other is recessive, it won't express that trait. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both red and brown coloration.\n- If it has at least one C and no B, it will have red and plain.\n- If it has no C but at least one B, it will have plain and brown.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it will have plain and plain.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the probabilities correctly.\n\nProbability of having at least one C: 3/4 (since the probability of cc is 1/4)\nProbability of having at least one B: 3/4\n\nAssuming independence, the probability of having both traits expressed (i.e., having at least one C and at least one B) is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%.\n\nIf only one of the traits is expressed, the probability is lower. However, calculating the exact distribution of each phenotype requires considering all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the possible phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B): 9/16\nPhenotype B (C and not B): ?\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, for the given cross, we can directly determine the phenotypic ratio.\n\nGiven the parents: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",

C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by looking at the possible gametes each parent can contribute.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only contribute CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only contribute cb gametes.\n\nSo when crossing CB and cb, each F1 bird will receive one allele from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB: C and B\nFrom cb: c and b\n\nSo possible F1 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc (from C and c) and Bb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Each bird contributes one allele from each gene. So for the C locus: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. For the B locus: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. Therefore, F1 genotypes are Cc (for C) and Bb (for B). Thus, the F1 birds are CcBb. When selfing, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has an equal chance of occurring, so the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- C (present) \u2192 red\n- c (absent) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus: \n- B (present) \u2192 brown\n- b (absent) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. Each trait's presence is determined by the dominant allele. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All CcBb individuals will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when c is present and B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when c is present and B is absent.\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because it suggests all F2 birds have both traits expressed, which contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Maybe my approach is flawed. Let me try a different method.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. The F2 generation consists of four types of F2 birds:\n\n1. CC (25% of F2)\n2. Cc (50% of F2)\n3. cc (25% of F2)\n4. bb (25% of F2)\n\nEach of these has a specific phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the number of birds for each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype type. Assuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes (which isn't exactly true due to dominance, but here the genes are acting independently, so each phenotype's count is based on the product of probabilities).\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since all F2 must have either C or c, and B or b, but here we have four phenotypes, so I think the 'bb' is part of the phenotypic category where both are recessive.)\n\nWait, but actually, the 'bb' phenotype is separate from the 'cc' phenotype. Because 'cc' is a different genotype than 'bb.' So 'cc' would be 25%, and 'bb' would be 25%. Similarly, 'C' is 50%, and 'c' is 50%. So the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n\nPhenotype 3: cc (25%) \u2192 Plain, Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: bb (25%) \u2192 Plain, Checkered (25%)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because it assumes that all F2 birds have one of these four phenotypes, but without considering dominance. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead use the standard Punnett square approach. \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation includes four types of birds:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are all possible combinations of these. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe frequencies for each phenotype are determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene. Since each gene has a 50% chance of being present or recessive, the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n- Phenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192(1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\u219225%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but that doesn't match the options given. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 plain red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these seem to add up to 100%, which makes me think I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, and the possible phenotypes are the four combinations. But perhaps the actual counts aren't all equal because of the dominance hierarchy. Let me approach it differently by listing all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes, then summing the frequencies.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Cc (red, checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc (plain, brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. bb (plain, checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and the two genes are independent, the phenotype percentages are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Total: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red, Checkered):\n\n- C present (1), B recessive (0)\n- Total: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain, Brown):\n\n- C recessive (0), B present (1)\n- Total: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered):\n\n- C recessive (0), B recessive (0)\n- Total: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis suggests that all F2 birds have both traits expressed, which can't be right because that would mean 100% of the population has both traits. This indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Perhaps I misunderstood how the traits combine. Let me reconsider. In reality, a bird can exhibit either trait or neither, depending on the alleles. For example, a bird could have C (pigment red) and c (plain), resulting in red and plain, regardless of B. Similarly, it could have B (brown) and b (checkered), leading to brown and checkered. So the possible combinations are indeed four, but the probabilities aren't necessarily 25% each.\n\nWait, no\u2014because each trait is expressed only if the allele is dominant. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding trait. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nBut this can't be right because that would imply all F2 have both traits. However, considering that each trait is expressed only if the allele is dominant, the presence of dominant alleles ensures the trait is expressed. So in reality, the four phenotypes are possible, but their frequencies depend on the combinations of the two genes.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n   - B dominant \u2192 Brown\n   - Phenotype 1: Pigment red, Brown\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n   - B recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   - Phenotype 2: Pigment red, Checkered\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - c dominant \u2192 Plain\n   - B dominant \u2192 Brown\n   - Phenotype 3: Plain, Brown\n\n4. bb (25%):\n   - c dominant \u2192 Plain\n   - b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   - Phenotype 4: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, adding up the contributions:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n- Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nTotal: 100%\n\nBut according to the options given, none of them have 25% for each phenotype. Instead, they vary in the numbers. Let me look at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown. That sums to 16, which is less than 100%. Option H: 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown. Sum is 16. Option D: 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown. Sum is 16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option E: 3+9+1+3=16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Option B: 8+4+4+4=20. Option C:9+3+3+1=16. Option I:7+5+1+3=16.\n\nHmm, all options except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I sum to 16, which doesn't account for the entire population. That's confusing because the total number of birds should add up to 100%. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio\" after showing the expected phenotypes and the genotypes. So perhaps the options represent the number of each phenotype relative to the total, rather than absolute counts. For example, if there are 16 birds, the phenotypes would be represented as a fraction of 16.\n\nLooking at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown. That's 16 birds. The phenotypic ratio would be 12:2:2:0, simplifying to 6:1:1:0. But none of the options seem to align perfectly with this. Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the exact number based on the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts based on the F2 genotypes. Each genotype corresponds to a certain phenotype, and the number of birds with each genotype is proportional to their frequency. So:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 birds\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- bb: 0% (since all F2 must have either C or c, and B or b, but here we have four phenotypes, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, no\u2014the 'bb' phenotype is part of the phenotypic categories, but perhaps in terms of the F2 generation, the 'bb' phenotype refers to the same as 'cc' but with the opposite traits, i.e., plain and checkered. So 'bb' is equivalent to 'cc' in terms of phenotypes but a different genotype. Therefore, the number of 'bb' birds would correspond to 'cc' birds.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation has:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 birds\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- bb: 0% \u2192 0 birds (assuming the 'bb' phenotype is equivalent to 'cc')\n\nThus, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1): CC (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n2. Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2): Cc (50) + bb (0) = 50 birds\n3. Plain and brown (phenotype 3): cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n4. Plain and checkered (phenotype 4): cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125 birds, which seems excessive. Clearly, I'm making a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'bb' phenotype is not zero. Maybe I was wrong earlier about the 'bb' phenotype. Let me clarify: the 'bb' phenotype is the phenotype when both alleles are recessive, which would be plain and checkered. But since in F2, the genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (0%). So the 'bb' phenotype would correspond to the 'cc' phenotype in terms of appearance, but with different alleles. So the counts would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: CC (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Cc (50) + bb (0) = 50 birds\n- Plain and brown: cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n- Plain and checkered: cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n\nBut this still totals 125 birds, which is impossible. I must be missing something. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the 'bb' phenotype is not entirely absent. Perhaps I should consider that in F2, the 'bb' phenotype is actually present, but with the opposite traits compared to 'cc'. So, for example, 'bb' would correspond to 'cc' but with checkered instead of brown. Therefore, the 'bb' phenotype would have the same count as 'cc', which is 25%.\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (25 + 25) = 50%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (50 + 25) = 75%\n3. Plain and brown (25 + 25) = 50%\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by looking at the possible gametes each parent can contribute.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only contribute CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only contribute cb gametes.\n\nSo when crossing CB and cb, each F1 bird will receive one allele from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB: C and B\nFrom cb: c and b\n\nSo possible F1 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc (from C and c) and Bb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Each bird contributes one allele from each gene. So for the C locus: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. For the B locus: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. Therefore, F1 genotypes are Cc (for C) and Bb (for B). Thus, the F1 birds are CcBb. When selfing, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has an equal chance of occurring, so the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- C (present) \u2192 red\n- c (absent) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus: \n- B (present) \u2192 brown\n- b (absent) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. Each trait's presence is determined by the dominant allele. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All CcBb individuals will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when c is present and B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when c is present and B is absent.\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because it suggests all F2 birds have both traits expressed, which contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Maybe my approach is flawed. Let me try a different method.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes. The F2 generation consists of four types of F2 birds:\n\n1. CC (25% of F2)\n2. Cc (50% of F2)\n3. cc (25% of F2)\n4. bb (25% of F2)\n\nEach of these has a specific phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the number of birds for each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype type. Assuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes (which isn't exactly true due to dominance, but here the genes are acting independently, so each phenotype's count is based on the product of probabilities).\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since all F2 must have either C or c, and B or b, but here we have four phenotypes, so I think the 'bb' is part of the phenotypic category where both are recessive.)\n\nWait, but actually, the 'bb' phenotype is separate from the 'cc' phenotype. Because 'cc' is a different genotype than 'bb.' So 'cc' would be 25%, and 'bb' would be 25%. Similarly, 'C' is 50%, and 'c' is 50%. So the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 2: Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered (25%)\n\nPhenotype 3: cc (25%) \u2192 Plain, Brown (25%)\n\nPhenotype 4: bb (25%) \u2192 Plain, Checkered (25%)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because it assumes that all F2 birds have one of these four phenotypes, but without considering dominance. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead use the standard Punnett square approach. \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation includes four types of birds:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are all possible combinations of these. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe frequencies for each phenotype are determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene. Since each gene has a 50% chance of being present or recessive, the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 \u219225%\n- Phenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192(1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\u219225%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but that doesn't match the options given. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 plain red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 plain red, 1 checkered brown, 3 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these seem to add up to 100%, which makes me think I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, and the possible phenotypes are the four combinations. But perhaps the actual counts aren't all equal because of the dominance hierarchy. Let me approach it differently by listing all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes, then summing the frequencies.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n1. BB (25%)\n2. Bb (50%)\n3. bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Cc (red, checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc (plain, brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. bb (plain, checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and the two genes are independent, the phenotype percentages are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Total: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red, Checkered):\n\n- C present (1), B recessive (0)\n- Total: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain, Brown):\n\n- C recessive (0), B present (1)\n- Total: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered):\n\n- C recessive (0), B recessive (0)\n- Total: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis suggests that all F2 birds have both traits expressed, which can't be right because that would mean 100% of the population has both traits. This indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Perhaps I misunderstood how the traits combine. Let me reconsider. In reality, a bird can exhibit either trait or neither, depending on the alleles. For example, a bird could have C (pigment red) and c (plain), resulting in red and plain, regardless of B. Similarly, it could have B (brown) and b (checkered), leading to brown and checkered. So the possible combinations are indeed four, but the probabilities aren't necessarily 25% each.\n\nWait, no\u2014because each trait is expressed only if the allele is dominant. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the corresponding trait. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nBut this can't be right because that would imply all F2 have both traits. However, considering that each trait is expressed only if the allele is dominant, the presence of dominant alleles ensures the trait is expressed. So in reality, the four phenotypes are possible, but their frequencies depend on the combinations of the two genes.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n   - B dominant \u2192 Brown\n   - Phenotype 1: Pigment red, Brown\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n   - B recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   - Phenotype 2: Pigment red, Checkered\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - c dominant \u2192 Plain\n   - B dominant \u2192 Brown\n   - Phenotype 3: Plain, Brown\n\n4. bb (25%):\n   - c dominant \u2192 Plain\n   - b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n   - Phenotype 4: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, adding up the contributions:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n- Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nTotal: 100%\n\nBut according to the options given, none of them have 25% for each phenotype. Instead, they vary in the numbers. Let me look at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown. That sums to 16, which is less than 100%. Option H: 5 checkered red, 3 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain brown. Sum is 16. Option D: 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown. Sum is 16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option E: 3+9+1+3=16. Option F: 4+4+4+4=16. Option B: 8+4+4+4=20. Option C:9+3+3+1=16. Option I:7+5+1+3=16.\n\nHmm, all options except A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I sum to 16, which doesn't account for the entire population. That's confusing because the total number of birds should add up to 100%. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio\" after showing the expected phenotypes and the genotypes. So perhaps the options represent the number of each phenotype relative to the total, rather than absolute counts. For example, if there are 16 birds, the phenotypes would be represented as a fraction of 16.\n\nLooking at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 checkered brown, 0 plain brown. That's 16 birds. The phenotypic ratio would be 12:2:2:0, simplifying to 6:1:1:0. But none of the options seem to align perfectly with this. Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the exact number based on the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts based on the F2 genotypes. Each genotype corresponds to a certain phenotype, and the number of birds with each genotype is proportional to their frequency. So:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 birds\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- bb: 0% (since all F2 must have either C or c, and B or b, but here we have four phenotypes, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, no\u2014the 'bb' phenotype is part of the phenotypic categories, but perhaps in terms of the F2 generation, the 'bb' phenotype refers to the same as 'cc' but with the opposite traits, i.e., plain and checkered. So 'bb' is equivalent to 'cc' in terms of phenotypes but a different genotype. Therefore, the number of 'bb' birds would correspond to 'cc' birds.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation has:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 birds\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 birds\n- bb: 0% \u2192 0 birds (assuming the 'bb' phenotype is equivalent to 'cc')\n\nThus, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1): CC (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n2. Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2): Cc (50) + bb (0) = 50 birds\n3. Plain and brown (phenotype 3): cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n4. Plain and checkered (phenotype 4): cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125 birds, which seems excessive. Clearly, I'm making a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'bb' phenotype is not zero. Maybe I was wrong earlier about the 'bb' phenotype. Let me clarify: the 'bb' phenotype is the phenotype when both alleles are recessive, which would be plain and checkered. But since in F2, the genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (0%). So the 'bb' phenotype would correspond to the 'cc' phenotype in terms of appearance, but with different alleles. So the counts would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: CC (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Cc (50) + bb (0) = 50 birds\n- Plain and brown: cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n- Plain and checkered: cc (25) + bb (0) = 25 birds\n\nBut this still totals 125 birds, which is impossible. I must be missing something. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the 'bb' phenotype is not entirely absent. Perhaps I should consider that in F2, the 'bb' phenotype is actually present, but with the opposite traits compared to 'cc'. So, for example, 'bb' would correspond to 'cc' but with checkered instead of brown. Therefore, the 'bb' phenotype would have the same count as 'cc', which is 25%.\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (25 + 25) = 50%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (50 + 25) = 75%\n3. Plain and brown (25 + 25) = 50%\n",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, each bird has two independent genes, so each gene contributes to one trait.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, each bird has two independent genes, so each gene contributes to one trait. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, it expresses both traits. But in our case, since the genes are independent, each bird could potentially have either trait or neither, depending on the alleles. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not how dominance works. In dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. So a bird with at least one dominant C allele will have pigment red, regardless of B. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant B allele will have brown color, regardless of C. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: if both C and B are present (either C dominant and/or B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: if C is present (so red) but B is absent (so checkered)\n3. Plain and brown: if C is absent (so plain) but B is present (so brown)\n4. Plain and checkered: if C is absent and B is absent\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each trait is determined separately. Pigment red is determined by C, and brown is determined by B. So a bird with C (dominant) will have pigment red, and a bird with B (dominant) will have brown color. So the phenotype is a combination of the traits determined by each gene. Thus, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain AND checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by finding the probability of each gene combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nFor the C gene:\n\n- Probability of C (C_: pigment red) = 1 (since both parents are CC, so all offspring get C)\n- Probability of c (c_: plain) = 0 (all offspring get c)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- Probability of B (B_: brown) = 1 (both parents are BB, so all offspring get B)\n- Probability of b (b_: checkered) = 0 (all offspring get b)\n\nWait, hold on! That can\u2019t be right because then all offspring would have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100% for each phenotype, which isn't the case here. I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is governed by gene C, where C is dominant (so any C allele results in checkered) and c is recessive (plain). Similarly, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant (any B allele results in brown), and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of whether they have pigment red or plain and whether they have brown or checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_)\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_)\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in the offspring.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes because both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, all F1 offspring will receive CB and cb gametes, resulting in the F1 genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment, any color for B):\n   - Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_: brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc (red pigment, checkered):\n   - Pigment red (C_), Checkered (b_: checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n3. cc (plain pigment, any color for B):\n   - Pigment plain (c_), Brown (B_: brown)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. bb (plain pigment, checkered):\n   - Pigment plain (c_), Checkered (b_: checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits:\n\n- Pigment: determined by C (red) and c (plain)\n- Color: determined by B (brown) and b (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2.\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Plain brown)\n- 25% bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the four phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits. So each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Therefore, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 50% (25% + 25%)\n\nBecause both cc and bb result in Plain brown, adding up to 50%.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 1 : 2\n\nWhich corresponds to option A: 6, 2, 6. But wait, that adds up to 1+1+2=4 parts. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the actual numbers, each phenotype occurs in a certain proportion. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 2 parts\n- Plain brown: same as above\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:2, which is option A. But looking back, the options given include various ratios. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A: 6, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 14 \u2192 6:6:2 = 3:3:1\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nWait, perhaps the approach was wrong. Maybe instead of counting percentages directly, I should consider all possible combinations of gametes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me try that approach. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the gametes are CB and cb in equal amounts (assuming random assortment). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but that seems incomplete. Let me list all possible gamete combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the four genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_: brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Checkered (b_: checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c_), Brown (b_: brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, the number of each genotype in the F2 population:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc Bb: 50% (2/4)\n- cc bb: 25% (1/4)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Plain red \u2192 50%\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 50% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:2:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Wait, but maybe I'm miscounting the numbers. Let me see:\n\nIf each of the four phenotypes (Checkered red, Plain red, Plain brown) occur in 25%, 50%, and 25% respectively, then the ratio is 1:2:1. But none of the options match that exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6 \u2192 6:2:6 \u2192 3:1:3\nB. Checkered red 8, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:4 \u2192 2:1:1\nC. Checkered red 9, Plain red 3, Plain brown 3 \u2192 9:3:3 \u2192 3:1:1\nD. Checkered red 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 2:6:2 \u2192 1:3:1\nE. Checkered red 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:3 \u2192 1:3:1\nF. Checkered red 4, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1\nG. Checkered red 12, Plain red 2, Plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2 \u2192 6:1:1\nH. Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2\nI. Checkered red 7, Plain red 5, Plain brown 1 \u2192 7:5:1\n\nHmm, my calculation shows a ratio of 1:2:1, which isn't among the options. Let me reconsider. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Perhaps the presence of both dominant alleles leads to a different phenotype than just one dominant. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the checkered pattern is determined by C, and brown by B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the phenotypic classes should indeed combine both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSince brown and checkered are distinct traits, the last two phenotypes are both Plain brown. Therefore, the ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 50% : 25% \u2192 1:2:1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. But perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Let me go back to the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present: Plain, Brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C absent, B absent: Plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Plain brown, totaling 100%. None of the options reflect this exactly, but let me check the options again.\n\nWait, option G says Checkered red 12, Plain red 2, Plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2 \u2192 6:1:1. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E: Checkered red 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:3 \u2192 1:3:1. That also doesn't match. Option F: All 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1. Option D: Checkered red 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 2:6:2 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option H: Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2. Not matching. Option I: 7:5:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the gamete formation was incorrect. Let me revisit the gamete formation. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, what are the possible gametes?\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB gametes because both C and B are dominant.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb gametes because both c and b are recessive.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will receive CB and cb gametes, so F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, this seems to contradict earlier analysis. If F1 is CcBb, then F2 would have these genotypes. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment, any color for B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (red pigment, checkered) \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (plain pigment, any B) \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. bb (plain pigment, checkered) \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 50% (25% + 25%)\n\nThis gives a ratio of 1:1:2. But looking at the options, none directly match. However, perhaps the problem expects us to count the actual numbers of each phenotype based on the number of possible combinations, rather than relying solely on the percentage distribution. Let me try that approach.\n\nAssuming that each F2 individual is equally likely, and the four phenotypes correspond to the four genotypes above, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of the population \u2192 1 out of every 4\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1 out of every 4\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 2 out of every 4\n\nIf the total population is, say, 100, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Plain red: 25\n- Plain brown: 50\n\nBut the options don't provide such a split. Looking at option H: Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2. That sums to 10, which doesn't fit 25:25:50. Option F: All 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1. Not matching. Option D: 2,6,2 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option E: 3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option G: 12,2,2 \u2192 6:1:1. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem entirely. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Control involves a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.

The dihybrid cross refers to a cross between two birds: one that is homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and one that is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by selfing F1. But earlier analysis suggested that the F2 would have a 1:2:1 ratio for the phenotypes. However, perhaps the problem expects us to account for all possible combinations without relying solely on the percentage distribution, especially since the answer choices don't align perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the genotypic frequencies.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, each bird has two independent genes, so each gene contributes to one trait. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, it expresses both traits. But in our case, since the genes are independent, each bird could potentially have either trait or neither, depending on the alleles. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not how dominance works. In dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. So a bird with at least one dominant C allele will have pigment red, regardless of B. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant B allele will have brown color, regardless of C. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: if both C and B are present (either C dominant and/or B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: if C is present (so red) but B is absent (so checkered)\n3. Plain and brown: if C is absent (so plain) but B is present (so brown)\n4. Plain and checkered: if C is absent and B is absent\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each trait is determined separately. Pigment red is determined by C, and brown is determined by B. So a bird with C (dominant) will have pigment red, and a bird with B (dominant) will have brown color. So the phenotype is a combination of the traits determined by each gene. Thus, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red AND brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red AND checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain AND brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain AND checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by finding the probability of each gene combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nFor the C gene:\n\n- Probability of C (C_: pigment red) = 1 (since both parents are CC, so all offspring get C)\n- Probability of c (c_: plain) = 0 (all offspring get c)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- Probability of B (B_: brown) = 1 (both parents are BB, so all offspring get B)\n- Probability of b (b_: checkered) = 0 (all offspring get b)\n\nWait, hold on! That can\u2019t be right because then all offspring would have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100% for each phenotype, which isn't the case here. I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is governed by gene C, where C is dominant (so any C allele results in checkered) and c is recessive (plain). Similarly, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant (any B allele results in brown), and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of whether they have pigment red or plain and whether they have brown or checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_)\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_)\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_)\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in the offspring.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes because both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, all F1 offspring will receive CB and cb gametes, resulting in the F1 genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment, any color for B):\n   - Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_: brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc (red pigment, checkered):\n   - Pigment red (C_), Checkered (b_: checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n3. cc (plain pigment, any color for B):\n   - Pigment plain (c_), Brown (B_: brown)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n4. bb (plain pigment, checkered):\n   - Pigment plain (c_), Checkered (b_: checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits:\n\n- Pigment: determined by C (red) and c (plain)\n- Color: determined by B (brown) and b (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C_) and checkered (b_) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain (c_) and brown (B_) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain (c_) and checkered (b_) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2.\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered red)\n- 25% Cc (Plain red)\n- 25% cc (Plain brown)\n- 25% bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the four phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits. So each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Therefore, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 50% (25% + 25%)\n\nBecause both cc and bb result in Plain brown, adding up to 50%.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 1 : 2\n\nWhich corresponds to option A: 6, 2, 6. But wait, that adds up to 1+1+2=4 parts. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the actual numbers, each phenotype occurs in a certain proportion. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 2 parts\n- Plain brown: same as above\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:2, which is option A. But looking back, the options given include various ratios. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A: 6, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 14 \u2192 6:6:2 = 3:3:1\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nWait, perhaps the approach was wrong. Maybe instead of counting percentages directly, I should consider all possible combinations of gametes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me try that approach. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the gametes are CB and cb in equal amounts (assuming random assortment). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but that seems incomplete. Let me list all possible gamete combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the four genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_: brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Checkered (b_: checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c_), Brown (b_: brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, the number of each genotype in the F2 population:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc Bb: 50% (2/4)\n- cc bb: 25% (1/4)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Plain red \u2192 50%\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 50% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:2:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Wait, but maybe I'm miscounting the numbers. Let me see:\n\nIf each of the four phenotypes (Checkered red, Plain red, Plain brown) occur in 25%, 50%, and 25% respectively, then the ratio is 1:2:1. But none of the options match that exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6 \u2192 6:2:6 \u2192 3:1:3\nB. Checkered red 8, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:4 \u2192 2:1:1\nC. Checkered red 9, Plain red 3, Plain brown 3 \u2192 9:3:3 \u2192 3:1:1\nD. Checkered red 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 2:6:2 \u2192 1:3:1\nE. Checkered red 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:3 \u2192 1:3:1\nF. Checkered red 4, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1\nG. Checkered red 12, Plain red 2, Plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2 \u2192 6:1:1\nH. Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2\nI. Checkered red 7, Plain red 5, Plain brown 1 \u2192 7:5:1\n\nHmm, my calculation shows a ratio of 1:2:1, which isn't among the options. Let me reconsider. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Perhaps the presence of both dominant alleles leads to a different phenotype than just one dominant. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the checkered pattern is determined by C, and brown by B. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the phenotypic classes should indeed combine both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSince brown and checkered are distinct traits, the last two phenotypes are both Plain brown. Therefore, the ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Plain red : Plain brown = 25% : 50% : 25% \u2192 1:2:1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. But perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Let me go back to the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. C absent, B present: Plain, Brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C absent, B absent: Plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the ratio is 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Plain brown, totaling 100%. None of the options reflect this exactly, but let me check the options again.\n\nWait, option G says Checkered red 12, Plain red 2, Plain brown 2 \u2192 12:2:2 \u2192 6:1:1. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E: Checkered red 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:3 \u2192 1:3:1. That also doesn't match. Option F: All 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1. Option D: Checkered red 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 2:6:2 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option H: Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2. Not matching. Option I: 7:5:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the gamete formation was incorrect. Let me revisit the gamete formation. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, what are the possible gametes?\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB gametes because both C and B are dominant.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb gametes because both c and b are recessive.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will receive CB and cb gametes, so F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, this seems to contradict earlier analysis. If F1 is CcBb, then F2 would have these genotypes. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment, any color for B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (red pigment, checkered) \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. cc (plain pigment, any B) \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Plain brown\n4. bb (plain pigment, checkered) \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 50% (25% + 25%)\n\nThis gives a ratio of 1:1:2. But looking at the options, none directly match. However, perhaps the problem expects us to count the actual numbers of each phenotype based on the number of possible combinations, rather than relying solely on the percentage distribution. Let me try that approach.\n\nAssuming that each F2 individual is equally likely, and the four phenotypes correspond to the four genotypes above, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of the population \u2192 1 out of every 4\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1 out of every 4\n- Plain brown: 50% \u2192 2 out of every 4\n\nIf the total population is, say, 100, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25\n- Plain red: 25\n- Plain brown: 50\n\nBut the options don't provide such a split. Looking at option H: Checkered red 5, Plain red 3, Plain brown 2 \u2192 5:3:2. That sums to 10, which doesn't fit 25:25:50. Option F: All 4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1. Not matching. Option D: 2,6,2 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option E: 3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:1. Not matching. Option G: 12,2,2 \u2192 6:1:1. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem entirely. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Control involves a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, wait! The dihybrid cross refers to a cross between two birds: one that is homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and one that is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by selfing F1. But earlier analysis suggested that the F2 would have a 1:2:1 ratio for the phenotypes. However, perhaps the problem expects us to account for all possible combinations without relying solely on the percentage distribution, especially since the answer choices don't align perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the genotypic frequencies. Let me recount the possible F2 genotypes:\n\nAfter F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- Cc (from cb x CB)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n\nSo the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, c c, and cc. Now, translating these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Plain brown\n\nSo the genotypic frequencies are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. But given the parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring would have both traits expressed. Wait, but looking back at the options, the answer choices don't include all four phenotypes. Hmm, that suggests I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, the user provided options where each option lists four phenotypes with specific counts. For example, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But wait, all the options sum up to 16 (6+2+6+2=16), suggesting 16 possible phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Perhaps the issue is that the parents are not both fully expressing the traits, but according to the problem statement, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, meaning they are pure breed for both traits. Thus, all their offspring would have both traits expressed. But then why do the options list four phenotypes instead of one? This seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, considering the number of birds with each phenotype. Wait, but according to the user's problem statement, the options seem to list four phenotypes with specific counts, implying that the actual count isn't 16, but perhaps less. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider the actual number of birds with each phenotype based on their genotypes. So each bird in the F2 generation will have a certain genotype, and based on that, determine the phenotype. Then, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options suggest that there are four phenotypes, each with a specific count. So perhaps the way to approach this is to first determine the possible genotypes in F2, then map those to phenotypes, and finally compute the ratio.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed:\n\nThe F1 generated from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, as established earlier. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at a 50% frequency. When these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C locus)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- cb + CB \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- Cc \u00d7 cc\n- cc \u00d7 Cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- C_: Pigment red (dominant)\n- cc_: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb_: Checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So each bird will have a phenotype based on both loci.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider the number of birds with each possible combination of C/Cc and B/Bb.\n\nWait, but each bird is diploid, so each gene acts independently. So the number of phenotypic categories is 3 (for C) \u00d7 3 (for B) = 9 possible phenotypes. However, the options only list four, so perhaps the question is focusing on the count of birds with each phenotype rather than the distinct phenotypes themselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the recessive traits and focus only on the dominant ones. But that wouldn't make much sense because the question specifically mentions both pigment color and body color.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b). Each trait is determined by one gene. The presence of a dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So a bird will have both traits unless both genes are recessive (which is impossible here since the parents are pure and can't produce such offspring).\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are CC BB and cc bb, all their offspring will be CcBb. So every bird in F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, leading to one phenotype for both traits. But none of the options have a single phenotype. Instead, they list four different phenotypes, which suggests that my previous understanding is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about expressing both traits but about the presence or absence of one trait regardless of the other. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it might still be considered as having red color, and similarly for body color. But in reality, since both genes are always dominant, all birds would exhibit both traits. This inconsistency makes me think that perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering each trait separately. For instance, the phenotypic ratio could be broken down into the number of birds with each trait, regardless of the other. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) would have red color, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for body color (B) would have brown color. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nSince all F2 birds have at least one dominant allele for both genes, all will have both traits expressed, making them belong to the first phenotype. But the options don't reflect that\u2014they each sum to 16, but indicate four phenotypes. This suggests that perhaps the question is intended to focus on the number of dominant and recessive alleles, leading to a different calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles, without considering the recessive ones. But in reality, all birds would have both traits expressed, so it's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering only the presence of pigment (C) and body color (B), treating them as separate traits, ignoring dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment present (C): red\n2. Body color present (B): brown\nCombined, the phenotypes would be four combinations:\n\na. Both present: red brown\nb. Pigment present, body absent: red checkered\nc. Pigment absent, body present: plain brown\nd. Both absent: plain checkered\n\nIn this interpretation, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of birds with each combination. Since all F2 birds have both traits expressed, all would be categorized under the first phenotype (red brown). But again, the options don't align with this, indicating I must have misunderstood something.\n\nPerhaps the key lies in the fact that the problem involves dihybrid crosses and requires constructing a Punnett square, but the options suggest a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, let me try recalculating the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes in F2.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype for both genes, which can be represented as:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - CC: Pigment red\n  - Cc: Pigment red\n  - cc: Plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB: Brown\n  - Bb: Brown\n  - bb: Checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC \u00d7 bb = Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB = CcBB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb = Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc \u00d7 BB = ccBB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb = ccBb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc \u00d7 bb = ccbb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, categorizing each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Phenotype 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Phenotype 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Checkered: Phenotype 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, but the options sum to 16, so perhaps the question considers the number of birds with each phenotype as the count, not the distinct types. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including the recessive ones, leading to different phenotypic ratios.\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest that the phenotypic ratio is being calculated as 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16 (6+2+6+2=16), matching the 16 possible F2 birds. But according to our analysis, the phenotypic distribution would be 4 (pigment red and brown) + 2 (pigment red and checkered) + 2 (plain and brown) + 1 (plain and checkered) = 9, which doesn't match the options. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, without considering the recessive ones. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is considered to have red color, and similarly for body color. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one for body color: red brown\n2. At least one dominant allele for pigment but none for body: red checkered\n3. None for pigment but at least one for body: plain brown\n4. Neither for pigment nor body: plain checkered\n\nCalculating the number of birds for each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: All birds with at least one dominant allele in both genes \u2192 Phenotype 1: 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 3) + 2 (phenotype 6) + 1 (phenotype 9) = 9\n- Phenotype 2: Birds with pigment red (phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5) but not brown (phenotype 3, 6) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 4 + 2 = 6\n- Phenotype 3: Birds with body brown (phenotype 3, 6) but not pigment red (phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 2 + 2 = 4\n- Phenotype 4: Birds with neither dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThis gives a ratio of 9:6:4:1, which also doesn't match any of the options. \n\nAt this point, I realize that perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe the question is simply asking for the standard F2 phenotypic ratio without considering the recessive traits, which is typically 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on the observed dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of birds that carry dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring the recessive ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each phenotype, irrespective of the number of dominant or recessive alleles. For example, each bird may be classified as having red pigment (dominant) and/or brown color (dominant), leading to four phenotypes:\n\n1. Red and Brown\n2. Red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nAssuming that all F2 birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all would be categorized as Phenotype 1, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of birds that exhibit each trait, regardless of the other. For example:\n\n- Pigment red: all birds with at least one dominant allele for pigment \u2192 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 4) + 2 (phenotype 5) + 1 (phenotype 7) + 1 (phenotype 8) = 12\n- Pigment brown: all birds with at least one dominant allele for brown \u2192 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 3) + 2 (phenotype 6) + 1 (phenotype 9) = 9\n- Plain: all birds with none dominant for pigment \u2192 1 (phenotype 7) + 1 (phenotype 8) = 2\n- Checkered: all birds with none dominant for body color \u2192 1 (phenotype 9)\n\nBut this approach doesn't fit the options either. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for a different angle. Maybe the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of the dihybrid cross, considering each gene's independent assortment and dominance.\n\nGiven that, the standard F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypic categories. However, depending on the dominance pattern, the numbers might change. For example, if both traits are dominant, the ratio remains the same, but if one trait is recessive, the numbers adjust accordingly.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option J states a phenotypic ratio of 2:6:3:1, but that sums to 12, whereas the total number of F2 birds is 16. Option G states 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't add up to 16. Option D is 1:1:3:9, which sums to 14, which is inconsistent. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 5+3+2+6=16. Yes, that matches the total number of F2 birds (assuming each parent contributes two alleles, resulting in four gametes, and the Punnett square would yield 16 possible combinations).\n\nBut how does this correspond to the phenotypic ratio? Let me map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to know the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Each bird's genotype will determine its phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Genotype: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes are:\n\n- CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nWhen combined, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C locus)\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for both)\n- cC \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- cC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n- cC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that after dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for pigment\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for color\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (cc) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (cc) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of birds with each phenotype. To find the ratio, I'll need to calculate how many birds have each phenotype.\n\nUsing the standard dihybrid cross results:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nBut this assumes that both traits are dominant. However, if only pigment is dominant and color is recessive, the calculations change. Similarly, vice versa.\n\nLooking back at the problem, the first parent is CC BB (pure red, pure brown), and the second is cc bb (pure plain, pure checkered). The dihybrid cross would involve crossing these, but the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing.\n\nHowever, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be all possible combinations. The phenotypic ratio would depend on the dominance patterns of each trait.\n\nBut given the options, I think the intended approach is to use the dihybrid cross formula and apply it to the given phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds with each phenotype, disregarding the exact dominance. For example, if pigment is dominant, all birds with at least one dominant allele for pigment have red color, and similarly for body color. In this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to a different ratio. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is considered to have red color, and similarly for body color. In",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. But given the parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring would have both traits expressed. Wait, but looking back at the options, the answer choices don't include all four phenotypes. Hmm, that suggests I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, the user provided options where each option lists four phenotypes with specific counts. For example, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But wait, all the options sum up to 16 (6+2+6+2=16), suggesting 16 possible phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Perhaps the issue is that the parents are not both fully expressing the traits, but according to the problem statement, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, meaning they are pure breed for both traits. Thus, all their offspring would have both traits expressed. But then why do the options list four phenotypes instead of one? This seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, considering the number of birds with each phenotype. Wait, but according to the user's problem statement, the options seem to list four phenotypes with specific counts, implying that the actual count isn't 16, but perhaps less. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider the actual number of birds with each phenotype based on their genotypes. So each bird in the F2 generation will have a certain genotype, and based on that, determine the phenotype. Then, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by counting how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options suggest that there are four phenotypes, each with a specific count. So perhaps the way to approach this is to first determine the possible genotypes in F2, then map those to phenotypes, and finally compute the ratio.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed:\n\nThe F1 generated from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, as established earlier. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at a 50% frequency. When these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C locus)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- cb + CB \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- Cc \u00d7 cc\n- cc \u00d7 Cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- C_: Pigment red (dominant)\n- cc_: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb_: Checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So each bird will have a phenotype based on both loci.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider the number of birds with each possible combination of C/Cc and B/Bb.\n\nWait, but each bird is diploid, so each gene acts independently. So the number of phenotypic categories is 3 (for C) \u00d7 3 (for B) = 9 possible phenotypes. However, the options only list four, so perhaps the question is focusing on the count of birds with each phenotype rather than the distinct phenotypes themselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the recessive traits and focus only on the dominant ones. But that wouldn't make much sense because the question specifically mentions both pigment color and body color.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b). Each trait is determined by one gene. The presence of a dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So a bird will have both traits unless both genes are recessive (which is impossible here since the parents are pure and can't produce such offspring).\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are CC BB and cc bb, all their offspring will be CcBb. So every bird in F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, leading to one phenotype for both traits. But none of the options have a single phenotype. Instead, they list four different phenotypes, which suggests that my previous understanding is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about expressing both traits but about the presence or absence of one trait regardless of the other. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it might still be considered as having red color, and similarly for body color. But in reality, since both genes are always dominant, all birds would exhibit both traits. This inconsistency makes me think that perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering each trait separately. For instance, the phenotypic ratio could be broken down into the number of birds with each trait, regardless of the other. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) would have red color, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for body color (B) would have brown color. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nSince all F2 birds have at least one dominant allele for both genes, all will have both traits expressed, making them belong to the first phenotype. But the options don't reflect that\u2014they each sum to 16, but indicate four phenotypes. This suggests that perhaps the question is intended to focus on the number of dominant and recessive alleles, leading to a different calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles, without considering the recessive ones. But in reality, all birds would have both traits expressed, so it's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering only the presence of pigment (C) and body color (B), treating them as separate traits, ignoring dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment present (C): red\n2. Body color present (B): brown\nCombined, the phenotypes would be four combinations:\n\na. Both present: red brown\nb. Pigment present, body absent: red checkered\nc. Pigment absent, body present: plain brown\nd. Both absent: plain checkered\n\nIn this interpretation, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of birds with each combination. Since all F2 birds have both traits expressed, all would be categorized under the first phenotype (red brown). But again, the options don't align with this, indicating I must have misunderstood something.\n\nPerhaps the key lies in the fact that the problem involves dihybrid crosses and requires constructing a Punnett square, but the options suggest a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, let me try recalculating the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes in F2.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype for both genes, which can be represented as:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - CC: Pigment red\n  - Cc: Pigment red\n  - cc: Plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - BB: Brown\n  - Bb: Brown\n  - bb: Checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC \u00d7 bb = Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc \u00d7 BB = CcBB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc \u00d7 Bb = CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc \u00d7 bb = Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc \u00d7 BB = ccBB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb = ccBb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc \u00d7 bb = ccbb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, categorizing each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Phenotype 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Phenotype 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Checkered: Phenotype 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, but the options sum to 16, so perhaps the question considers the number of birds with each phenotype as the count, not the distinct types. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including the recessive ones, leading to different phenotypic ratios.\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest that the phenotypic ratio is being calculated as 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16 (6+2+6+2=16), matching the 16 possible F2 birds. But according to our analysis, the phenotypic distribution would be 4 (pigment red and brown) + 2 (pigment red and checkered) + 2 (plain and brown) + 1 (plain and checkered) = 9, which doesn't match the options. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles, without considering the recessive ones. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is considered to have red color, and similarly for body color. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one for body color: red brown\n2. At least one dominant allele for pigment but none for body: red checkered\n3. None for pigment but at least one for body: plain brown\n4. Neither for pigment nor body: plain checkered\n\nCalculating the number of birds for each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: All birds with at least one dominant allele in both genes \u2192 Phenotype 1: 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 3) + 2 (phenotype 6) + 1 (phenotype 9) = 9\n- Phenotype 2: Birds with pigment red (phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5) but not brown (phenotype 3, 6) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 4 + 2 = 6\n- Phenotype 3: Birds with body brown (phenotype 3, 6) but not pigment red (phenotype 1, 2, 4, 5) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 2 + 2 = 4\n- Phenotype 4: Birds with neither dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThis gives a ratio of 9:6:4:1, which also doesn't match any of the options. \n\nAt this point, I realize that perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe the question is simply asking for the standard F2 phenotypic ratio without considering the recessive traits, which is typically 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on the observed dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of birds that carry dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring the recessive ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each phenotype, irrespective of the number of dominant or recessive alleles. For example, each bird may be classified as having red pigment (dominant) and/or brown color (dominant), leading to four phenotypes:\n\n1. Red and Brown\n2. Red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nAssuming that all F2 birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all would be categorized as Phenotype 1, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the number of birds that exhibit each trait, regardless of the other. For example:\n\n- Pigment red: all birds with at least one dominant allele for pigment \u2192 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 4) + 2 (phenotype 5) + 1 (phenotype 7) + 1 (phenotype 8) = 12\n- Pigment brown: all birds with at least one dominant allele for brown \u2192 4 (phenotype 1) + 2 (phenotype 3) + 2 (phenotype 6) + 1 (phenotype 9) = 9\n- Plain: all birds with none dominant for pigment \u2192 1 (phenotype 7) + 1 (phenotype 8) = 2\n- Checkered: all birds with none dominant for body color \u2192 1 (phenotype 9)\n\nBut this approach doesn't fit the options either. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for a different angle. Maybe the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of the dihybrid cross, considering each gene's independent assortment and dominance.\n\nGiven that, the standard F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypic categories. However, depending on the dominance pattern, the numbers might change. For example, if both traits are dominant, the ratio remains the same, but if one trait is recessive, the numbers adjust accordingly.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option J states a phenotypic ratio of 2:6:3:1, but that sums to 12, whereas the total number of F2 birds is 16. Option G states 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't add up to 16. Option D is 1:1:3:9, which sums to 14, which is inconsistent. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 5+3+2+6=16. Yes, that matches the total number of F2 birds (assuming each parent contributes two alleles, resulting in four gametes, and the Punnett square would yield 16 possible combinations).\n\nBut how does this correspond to the phenotypic ratio? Let me map the F2 genotypes to phenotypes based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to know the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Each bird's genotype will determine its phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Genotype: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes are:\n\n- CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nWhen combined, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C locus)\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 cc (for C locus)\n- Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for both)\n- cC \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc \u00d7 Cc (for c locus)\n- cC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n- cC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc \u00d7 cc (for c locus)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that after dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for pigment\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for color\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (cc) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (cc) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of birds with each phenotype. To find the ratio, I'll need to calculate how many birds have each phenotype.\n\nUsing the standard dihybrid cross results:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nBut this assumes that both traits are dominant. However, if only pigment is dominant and color is recessive, the calculations change. Similarly, vice versa.\n\nLooking back at the problem, the first parent is CC BB (pure red, pure brown), and the second is cc bb (pure plain, pure checkered). The dihybrid cross would involve crossing these, but the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing.\n\nHowever, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be all possible combinations. The phenotypic ratio would depend on the dominance patterns of each trait.\n\nBut given the options, I think the intended approach is to use the dihybrid cross formula and apply it to the given phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds with each phenotype, disregarding the exact dominance. For example, if pigment is dominant, all birds with at least one dominant allele for pigment have red color, and similarly for body color. In this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to a different ratio. For example, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment is considered to have red color, and similarly for body color. In",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So all birds in this cross will have either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered.",
    "rollout": " So all birds in this cross will have either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's see:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 must produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 must produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 will be CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (prob 25%)\n- Cc (prob 50%)\n- cc (prob 25%)\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- CC: pigment red\n- Cc: pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: pigment plain\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nNow, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both genes. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider how many F2 individuals exhibit each combination.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC ( pigment red )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - So, Phenotype 1a: Pigment red and brown\n   - Phenotype 1b: Pigment red and checkered\n\n2. Cc ( pigment red )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - Phenotype 2a: Pigment red and brown\n   - Phenotype 2b: Pigment red and checkered\n\n3. cc ( pigment plain )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - Phenotype 3a: Pigment plain and brown\n   - Phenotype 3b: Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype. Since each F2 individual is produced by a random combination of F1 gametes, and each F1 gamete is equally likely (25% CB, 25% cb), we can model the possible F2 genotypes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes after selfing are:\n\n- 25% CC (all red)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n- 25% Cc (all red)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 1b: Red and Checkered\n- 25% cc (all plain)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 3a: Plain and Brown\n- 25% cc (all plain)\n   - 100% bb (all checkered)\n      - Phenotype 3b: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, that's not quite accurate. Because when you self CC, you get all C, so all red, and Bb will always have B, so all brown. Similarly, Cc selfed will give C (red) and B (brown), so all red and brown. cc selfed will give c (plain) and B (brown), so all plain and brown. And cc selfed again with bb gives c (plain) and bb (checkered), so all plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% Red and Brown (phenotype 1a)\n- 25% Red and Checkered (phenotype 1b)\n- 25% Plain and Brown (phenotype 3a)\n- 25% Plain and Checkered (phenotype 3b)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype category. But looking at the options, none directly say that. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6 checkered red : 2 checkered brown : 6 plain red : 2 plain brown \u2192 Not matching our calculation.\n\nB. 8 checkered red : 4 checkered brown : 0 plain red : 4 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown \u2192 Our calculation shows 25% each, so 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. None of the options show 1:1:1:1, except perhaps option D.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems off because according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 25%, so 25 each. But the options don't reflect that. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (which is CcBB?) Wait no, CC BB means both alleles are dominant, so the gametes are CB. Similarly, cc bb means both alleles are recessive, so gametes are cb.\n\nWhen F1 is CcBB (wait, no, F1 is CcBb, as each parent contributes CB and cb gametes).\n\nWait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so in F2, the possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, for each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nEach combination is a unique phenotype. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC + BB: red and brown (1)\n- CC + Bb: red and brown (1)\n- CC + bb: red and checkered (1)\n- Cc + BB: red and brown (1)\n- Cc + Bb: red and brown (1)\n- Cc + bb: red and checkered (1)\n- cc + BB: plain and brown (1)\n- cc + Bb: plain and brown (1)\n- cc + bb: plain and checkered (1)\n\nSo each of the nine possible combinations has 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. But in reality, each bird will display exactly one phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts would be 9 parts, with each part corresponding to each phenotype. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nWait, option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that adds up to 16. Wait, but in reality, each bird can only be one type, so the sum shouldn't exceed the number of birds. Wait, but the options probably assume a large population where the ratios hold approximately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of birds rather than phenotypes. But the question asks for phenotypic ratios, so each phenotype should account for a quarter of the population. But the answer options suggest different distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The F2 generation is generated by the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, for pigment color (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of both. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Red and Brown\n2. C_Bb: Red and Brown\n3. C_bb: Red and Checkered\n4. c_B_: Plain and Brown\n5. c_Bb: Plain and Brown\n6. c_bb: Plain and Checkered\n7. c_c_: Plain and Checkered (Wait, no, c is recessive, so if C is recessive, it's 'c', same for B.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a Punnett square approach. Let me create a table:\n\n|           | C (parent) | c (parent) |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| B (parent) | CB        | cb        |\n| b         | CB        | cb        |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the gametes. The Punnett square combines the gametes. Each row represents the alleles from one parent, each column from the other.\n\nSo the rows are C and c (from Cc), columns are B and b (from BB).\n\nWait, no, the parents are CcBb, so each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbb    | cbbBb  |\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me instead represent the F2 phenotypes based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, each of these will have specific phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n2. Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2a: Red and Brown\n3. cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3a: Plain and Brown\n4. CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1a again\n5. Cc: Same as above\n6. cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3a\n7. CC: Again Phenotype 1a\n8. Cc: Again Phenotype 2a\n9. cc: Again Phenotype 3a\n\nBut in reality, each bird will be categorized into one of these four phenotypes. So in terms of count, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. However, none of the answer options match this. Perhaps I've misunderstood the question's requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio but something else. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Wait, that sums to 16 birds. So if each phenotype is represented by a certain number, let's see:\n\nIf the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, adding up to 16. This could correspond to 3/8, 1/8, 3/8, 1/8. Hmm, perhaps the actual ratios are 3:1:3:1 for each pair. But without knowing the exact mapping, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype, regardless of their order. So, for example, if 6 are checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which can be simplified to 3:1:3:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly say 3:1:3:1. However, option C is 9:3:3:1, which might be relevant if considering dominance within each gene separately. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and should refer back to the initial understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a Punnett square based on the F1 (CcBb) crossing itself. The F1 produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The Punnett square would be:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbb    | cbbBb  |\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The correct Punnett square for F1 x F1 would combine each gamete from F1 with each gamete from F1.\n\nSo:\n\n- From F1: each gamete is CB or cb.\n- So the F2 square is:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbB    | cbbB   |\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to list the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n- 50% cc (from cb and cb)\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct breakdown is:\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n- 25% cC (same as Cc)\n- 25% cc (from cb and cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb and cb)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to realize that the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n2. CC (pigment red) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 1b: Red and Brown\n3. CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 3a: Red and Checkered\n4. Cc (pigment red) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 2a: Red and Brown\n5. Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 2b: Red and Brown\n6. Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 3b: Red and Checkered\n7. cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 4a: Plain and Brown\n8. cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 4b: Plain and Brown\n9. cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 4c: Plain and Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 1a, 1b, 3a, 2a, 2b, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c \u2192 9 phenotypes.\n\nIn terms of count, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so in a large population, the ratio would be roughly 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 across the nine phenotypes. However, since the question is about the four main phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown), each appearing 25% of the time, the ratio among them would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them say 1:1:1:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to a situation where one phenotype is thrice as common as others. That might relate to considering dominance within each gene individually, such as 3/4 for pigment and 3/4 for body color, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each, hence 9:3:3:1. But that's a different approach, focusing on dominance, whereas the current question deals with independent assortment and combined traits.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that seems inconsistent with the 25% distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the percentage of each phenotype based on the possible combinations, leading to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, implying that one phenotype is three times as frequent as the others.\n\nWait, another thought: when considering the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each of the four phenotypes. So, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But perhaps the options are scaled differently. Looking at the options, none seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps option C is intended to represent the fact that checkered red and plain red are more common than checkered brown and plain brown, but that contradicts the 25% distribution.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. Let me try to compute the actual numbers. In the F2 generation, each bird can be classified into one of the four phenotypes. The number of birds with each phenotype would be proportional to their frequency. Since each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, if we're counting the number of birds for each phenotype, it would add up to 4 birds per F2 generation. But the options don't align with that. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of dominant vs recessive traits, not the actual bird count. So, for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: 3 dominant (RR, Rr, rR, rr?), but wait, no. For the pigment gene, dominant (C) leads to red, recessive (c) to plain. So, the phenotypes for pigment are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC, Cc \u2192 3/4 of the time\n- Plain red: cc \u2192 1/4 of the time\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Checkered brown: BB, Bb \u2192 3/4\n- Plain brown: bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. So, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- (3/4 pigment) * (3/4 body) = 9/16 checkered red\n- (3/4 pigment) * (1/4 body) = 3/16 checkered brown\n- (1/4 pigment) * (3/4 body) = 3/16 plain red\n- (1/4 pigment) * (1/4 body) = 1/16 plain brown\n\nThis gives us a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. So despite the initial confusion, the correct",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So all birds in this cross will have either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's see:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 must produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 must produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 will be CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (prob 25%)\n- Cc (prob 50%)\n- cc (prob 25%)\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- CC: pigment red\n- Cc: pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: pigment plain\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nNow, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both genes. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider how many F2 individuals exhibit each combination.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC ( pigment red )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - So, Phenotype 1a: Pigment red and brown\n   - Phenotype 1b: Pigment red and checkered\n\n2. Cc ( pigment red )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - Phenotype 2a: Pigment red and brown\n   - Phenotype 2b: Pigment red and checkered\n\n3. cc ( pigment plain )\n   - Bb or bb \u2192 brown or checkered\n   - Phenotype 3a: Pigment plain and brown\n   - Phenotype 3b: Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype. Since each F2 individual is produced by a random combination of F1 gametes, and each F1 gamete is equally likely (25% CB, 25% cb), we can model the possible F2 genotypes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes after selfing are:\n\n- 25% CC (all red)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n- 25% Cc (all red)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 1b: Red and Checkered\n- 25% cc (all plain)\n   - 100% Bb (all brown)\n      - Phenotype 3a: Plain and Brown\n- 25% cc (all plain)\n   - 100% bb (all checkered)\n      - Phenotype 3b: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, that's not quite accurate. Because when you self CC, you get all C, so all red, and Bb will always have B, so all brown. Similarly, Cc selfed will give C (red) and B (brown), so all red and brown. cc selfed will give c (plain) and B (brown), so all plain and brown. And cc selfed again with bb gives c (plain) and bb (checkered), so all plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% Red and Brown (phenotype 1a)\n- 25% Red and Checkered (phenotype 1b)\n- 25% Plain and Brown (phenotype 3a)\n- 25% Plain and Checkered (phenotype 3b)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype category. But looking at the options, none directly say that. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6 checkered red : 2 checkered brown : 6 plain red : 2 plain brown \u2192 Not matching our calculation.\n\nB. 8 checkered red : 4 checkered brown : 0 plain red : 4 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown \u2192 Our calculation shows 25% each, so 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. None of the options show 1:1:1:1, except perhaps option D.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems off because according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 25%, so 25 each. But the options don't reflect that. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (which is CcBB?) Wait no, CC BB means both alleles are dominant, so the gametes are CB. Similarly, cc bb means both alleles are recessive, so gametes are cb.\n\nWhen F1 is CcBB (wait, no, F1 is CcBb, as each parent contributes CB and cb gametes).\n\nWait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so in F2, the possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, for each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nEach combination is a unique phenotype. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC + BB: red and brown (1)\n- CC + Bb: red and brown (1)\n- CC + bb: red and checkered (1)\n- Cc + BB: red and brown (1)\n- Cc + Bb: red and brown (1)\n- Cc + bb: red and checkered (1)\n- cc + BB: plain and brown (1)\n- cc + Bb: plain and brown (1)\n- cc + bb: plain and checkered (1)\n\nSo each of the nine possible combinations has 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. But in reality, each bird will display exactly one phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts would be 9 parts, with each part corresponding to each phenotype. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to match 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nWait, option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that adds up to 16. Wait, but in reality, each bird can only be one type, so the sum shouldn't exceed the number of birds. Wait, but the options probably assume a large population where the ratios hold approximately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of birds rather than phenotypes. But the question asks for phenotypic ratios, so each phenotype should account for a quarter of the population. But the answer options suggest different distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The F2 generation is generated by the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, for pigment color (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of both. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Red and Brown\n2. C_Bb: Red and Brown\n3. C_bb: Red and Checkered\n4. c_B_: Plain and Brown\n5. c_Bb: Plain and Brown\n6. c_bb: Plain and Checkered\n7. c_c_: Plain and Checkered (Wait, no, c is recessive, so if C is recessive, it's 'c', same for B.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a Punnett square approach. Let me create a table:\n\n|           | C (parent) | c (parent) |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| B (parent) | CB        | cb        |\n| b         | CB        | cb        |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the gametes. The Punnett square combines the gametes. Each row represents the alleles from one parent, each column from the other.\n\nSo the rows are C and c (from Cc), columns are B and b (from BB).\n\nWait, no, the parents are CcBb, so each gamete is CB or cb. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbb    | cbbBb  |\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me instead represent the F2 phenotypes based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, each of these will have specific phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n2. Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2a: Red and Brown\n3. cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3a: Plain and Brown\n4. CC: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 1a again\n5. Cc: Same as above\n6. cc: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 3a\n7. CC: Again Phenotype 1a\n8. Cc: Again Phenotype 2a\n9. cc: Again Phenotype 3a\n\nBut in reality, each bird will be categorized into one of these four phenotypes. So in terms of count, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. However, none of the answer options match this. Perhaps I've misunderstood the question's requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio but something else. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Wait, that sums to 16 birds. So if each phenotype is represented by a certain number, let's see:\n\nIf the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, adding up to 16. This could correspond to 3/8, 1/8, 3/8, 1/8. Hmm, perhaps the actual ratios are 3:1:3:1 for each pair. But without knowing the exact mapping, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype, regardless of their order. So, for example, if 6 are checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown, the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which can be simplified to 3:1:3:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none directly say 3:1:3:1. However, option C is 9:3:3:1, which might be relevant if considering dominance within each gene separately. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and should refer back to the initial understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a Punnett square based on the F1 (CcBb) crossing itself. The F1 produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. The Punnett square would be:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbb    | cbbBb  |\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The correct Punnett square for F1 x F1 would combine each gamete from F1 with each gamete from F1.\n\nSo:\n\n- From F1: each gamete is CB or cb.\n- So the F2 square is:\n\n|       | CB     | cb    |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| CB    | CcBB   | CcBb   |\n| cb    | cBbB    | cbbB   |\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to list the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n- 50% cc (from cb and cb)\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The correct breakdown is:\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB and cb)\n- 25% cC (same as Cc)\n- 25% cc (from cb and cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb and cb)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to realize that the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 1a: Red and Brown\n2. CC (pigment red) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 1b: Red and Brown\n3. CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 3a: Red and Checkered\n4. Cc (pigment red) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 2a: Red and Brown\n5. Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 2b: Red and Brown\n6. Cc (pigment red) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 3b: Red and Checkered\n7. cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown): Phenotype 4a: Plain and Brown\n8. cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown): Phenotype 4b: Plain and Brown\n9. cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered): Phenotype 4c: Plain and Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 1a, 1b, 3a, 2a, 2b, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c \u2192 9 phenotypes.\n\nIn terms of count, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so in a large population, the ratio would be roughly 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 across the nine phenotypes. However, since the question is about the four main phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown), each appearing 25% of the time, the ratio among them would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them say 1:1:1:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to a situation where one phenotype is thrice as common as others. That might relate to considering dominance within each gene individually, such as 3/4 for pigment and 3/4 for body color, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each, hence 9:3:3:1. But that's a different approach, focusing on dominance, whereas the current question deals with independent assortment and combined traits.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that seems inconsistent with the 25% distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as considering the percentage of each phenotype based on the possible combinations, leading to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, implying that one phenotype is three times as frequent as the others.\n\nWait, another thought: when considering the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each of the four phenotypes. So, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But perhaps the options are scaled differently. Looking at the options, none seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps option C is intended to represent the fact that checkered red and plain red are more common than checkered brown and plain brown, but that contradicts the 25% distribution.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. Let me try to compute the actual numbers. In the F2 generation, each bird can be classified into one of the four phenotypes. The number of birds with each phenotype would be proportional to their frequency. Since each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, if we're counting the number of birds for each phenotype, it would add up to 4 birds per F2 generation. But the options don't align with that. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of dominant vs recessive traits, not the actual bird count. So, for each gene:\n\n- Pigment: 3 dominant (RR, Rr, rR, rr?), but wait, no. For the pigment gene, dominant (C) leads to red, recessive (c) to plain. So, the phenotypes for pigment are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC, Cc \u2192 3/4 of the time\n- Plain red: cc \u2192 1/4 of the time\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Checkered brown: BB, Bb \u2192 3/4\n- Plain brown: bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. So, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- (3/4 pigment) * (3/4 body) = 9/16 checkered red\n- (3/4 pigment) * (1/4 body) = 3/16 checkered brown\n- (1/4 pigment) * (3/4 body) = 3/16 plain red\n- (1/4 pigment) * (1/4 body) = 1/16 plain brown\n\nThis gives us a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. So despite the initial confusion, the correct",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain body, Brown pigment (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain body, Checkered pigment (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nAdding up, 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which makes sense. Now, looking back at the options given, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio across the F2 generation. The options provided are A to H, each with different ratios. Let's compare them with our calculation.\n\nOur calculation shows that each phenotype (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered) occurs with equal frequency, each at 25% of the population. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly state 25% each. Instead, the closest option seems to be H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Because in the options, numbers add up to 16, which isn't matching 25%, but perhaps the options represent approximate counts based on actual F2 ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The possible phenotypes are indeed four, each occurring at 25% of the F2 population. But the answer choices don't match exactly. Option H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these up: 5+3+2+6=16. Each phenotype corresponds to 25%, so 16 units would mean each phenotype accounts for 1 unit (since 16/4=4, which is 25% per unit). Wait, no\u2014if each phenotype is 25%, then 16 units correspond to 25% each. Hmm, maybe the question expects the number of birds with each phenotype, assuming a large enough sample where the distribution approximates the theoretical probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the actual gametes and create the Punnett square properly.\n\nWait, the user provided an initial attempt with gametes (CB, cb) leading to F1 (CcBb), and then created a Punnett square for F2. They labeled the gametes as CB, cb, cB, cb, and formed F2 with 4 types of gametes, each at 25%. Then, they mapped the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me re-examine the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation described.\n\nThe user's initial analysis was that the F2 has phenotypic ratios: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Adding those up: 6+2+6+2=16. So each phenotype is 25% (since 16 units / 4 phenotypes = 4 units per phenotype). Alternatively, maybe the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, with each phenotype being 25%. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, that sums to 16 as well. But none of the options reflect 25% each. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted. Let me try to recount the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2, each bird will have a certain phenotype based on the combination of C and B alleles. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C dominant (R) and B dominant (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body (Phenotype 1)\n2. C dominant (R) and B recessive (b) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body (Phenotype 2)\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B) \u2192 Plain body, Brown pigment (Phenotype 3)\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b) \u2192 Plain body, Checkered pigment (Phenotype 4)\n\nEach of these phenotypes occurs in a 25% proportion of the F2 population, assuming independent assortment and complete dominance. Therefore, the expected ratio should be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. However, the answer choices do not reflect this exact ratio. The closest option is H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't sum to 16. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure why. Let me look at the answer choices again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nSo, each option represents the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation. The correct ratio should be 4 parts (since 16 units divided into 4 phenotypes equals 4 units per phenotype), making each phenotype 4 units. Looking at the options, option H has checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16, which fits. But how does that translate to the number of each phenotype? If each phenotype is represented equally, each should have 4 units. So option H assigns 5,3,2,6, which totals 16. But that's unequal distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the F2 counts without perfect 25% each.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios based on the F1 selfing. The F1 is CcBb, and selfing results in four F2 genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb, each at 25% frequency. Then, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For the C locus, presence (red) or absence (plain). For the B locus, presence (brown) or absence (checkered).\n\nSo, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. C dominant (R) and B dominant (B): 25% \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n2. C dominant (R) and B recessive (b): 25% \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body\n3. C recessive (c) and B dominant (B): 25% \u2192 Plain body, Brown pigment\n4. C recessive (c) and B recessive (b): 25% \u2192 Plain body, Checkered pigment\n\nAssuming a large population, each phenotype will occur approximately 25% of the time. Thus, the F2 ratio should be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. However, none of the options perfectly reflects this 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. But wait, 5+3+2+6=16, which matches the total. However, the ratios aren't equal, which contradicts my previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in counting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that in F2, the number of each phenotype is proportional to the squares of the Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the F2 ratios.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 includes all combinations of C/B gametes. Each gene is independent, so the possible combinations are:\n\n- From F1 gametes: CB, cb, cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (50%).\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C dominant), Brown body (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain body, Brown pigment \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc: Plain body, Checkered pigment \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these 25% contributions to the F2 population will lead to the corresponding phenotype. Assuming equal representation among the F2 individuals, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. Therefore, the F2 population should have equal numbers of each phenotype. However, looking at the answer choices, none have equal distribution except for option H, which has unequal distribution. \n\nWait, perhaps the user used a different method to calculate the phenotypic ratio. Let me consider the possibility that the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is typical for two independent genes. Here, the phenotypes would be grouped by their dominance patterns. For instance, dominant B (brown) over dominant b (checkered) would group some phenotypes together.\n\nIf we treat each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles, we can categorize them as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 9\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 3\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain body, Brown pigment \u2192 3\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain body, Checkered pigment \u2192 1\n\nThis grouping would lead to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. But according to standard Mendelian ratios, this is the case. However, the user's initial analysis suggested a different ratio, possibly due to a misunderstanding of how the phenotypes are categorized.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio based on the F2 generation would be 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that the checkered color is recessive, so the presence of 'b' in the B locus leads to checkering. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio could be 9:3:3:1 based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nHowever, the user's initial analysis led them to the ratio 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16 and divides into 4 parts of 4 each. This suggests that the user might have incorrectly assumed that each phenotype occurs with equal frequency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the calculations would be option H, assigning checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. But this doesn't perfectly align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the F1 generation to determine the F2 ratios, leading them to the 6:2:6:2 ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option H, despite the uneven distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16 and aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but it groups the checkered phenotype under plain body, which may not be accurate based on the dominance hierarchy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either is recessive, it won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each gene determines a specific trait. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it will have red pigment regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B, it will have brown body regardless of C. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown body\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered body\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain body and Brown pigment\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain body and Checkered pigment\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (since both parents are CC)\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes after selfing would include both dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. Wait, no, each parent contributes either dominant or recessive alleles based on their gametes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. In F2, the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- 25% CC (C dominant, red)\n- 25% Cc (C dominant, red)\n- 25% cc (c recessive, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- 25% BB (B dominant, brown)\n- 25% Bb (B dominant, brown)\n- 25% bb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are the product of these probabilities. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain body, Brown pigment (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain body, Checkered pigment (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n\nAdding up, 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which makes sense. Now, looking back at the options given, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio across the F2 generation. The options provided are A to H, each with different ratios. Let's compare them with our calculation.\n\nOur calculation shows that each phenotype (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered) occurs with equal frequency, each at 25% of the population. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly state 25% each. Instead, the closest option seems to be H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Because in the options, numbers add up to 16, which isn't matching 25%, but perhaps the options represent approximate counts based on actual F2 ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The possible phenotypes are indeed four, each occurring at 25% of the F2 population. But the answer choices don't match exactly. Option H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these up: 5+3+2+6=16. Each phenotype corresponds to 25%, so 16 units would mean each phenotype accounts for 1 unit (since 16/4=4, which is 25% per unit).

Alternatively, maybe the correct ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, but that doesn't seem to fit the options.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, with each phenotype being 25%. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, that sums to 16 as well. But none of the options reflect 25% each. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are counted.

For instance, dominant B (brown) over dominant b (checkered) would group some phenotypes together.\n\nIf we treat each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles, we can categorize them as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 9\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 3\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain body, Brown pigment \u2192 3\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain body, Checkered pigment \u2192 1\n\nThis grouping would lead to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. But according to standard Mendelian ratios, this is the case. However, the user's initial analysis suggested a different ratio, possibly due to a misunderstanding of how the phenotypes are categorized.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio based on the F2 generation would be 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that the checkered color is recessive, so the presence of 'b' in the B locus leads to checkering. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio could be 9:3:3:1 based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nHowever, the user's initial analysis led them to the ratio 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16 and divides into 4 parts of 4 each. This suggests that the user might have incorrectly assumed that each phenotype occurs with equal frequency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the calculations would be option H, assigning checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. But this doesn't perfectly align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the F1 generation to determine the F2 ratios, leading them to the 6:2:6:2 ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option H, despite the uneven distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16 and aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but it groups the checkered phenotype under plain body, which may not be accurate based on the dominance hierarchy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't. So let's see:\n\nThe possible phenotypic combinations are:\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, brown.\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Pigment red, checkered.\n3. C recessive, B dominant (c and B): Plain, brown.\n4. C recessive, B recessive (c and b): Plain, checkered.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, the gametes will always carry the same alleles. For example, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, while Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Thus, the F1 will receive CB from each parent, making all F1 individuals CcBb. \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (with probability 25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (with probability 50%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc (with probability 50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc (with probability 25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes. Since each bird has two traits determined by separate genes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment (C): dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- Body color (B): dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC:\n- Pigment: C \u2192 red\n- Body color: C \u2192 brown\n\u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc:\n- Pigment: C \u2192 red\n- Body color: c \u2192 checkered\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\n3. Cc:\n- Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n\n4. cc:\n- Pigment: c \u2192 plain\n- Body color: b \u2192 checkered\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two independent traits, so the presence of one does not affect the other. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for example, if a bird has C (red) and B (brown), it will have both traits: checkered red. Similarly, if it has C and b, it'll have red and checkered: plain red. If it has c and B, it'll have plain and brown: plain brown. If it has c and b, it'll have plain and checkered: plain brown? Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because if both genes are recessive, then the bird will have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not a valid option here. Wait, no\u2014the options are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n- C dominant, b recessive (C and b): Plain red\n- c dominant, B dominant (c and B): Plain brown\n- c recessive, b recessive (c and b): Plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, the phenotype depends on whether the genes are dominant or recessive. So:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- If at least one C allele, pigment (red)\n- If none, plain\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- If at least one B allele, brown\n- If none, checkered\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), Body color brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C), Body color checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Body color checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this seems off because in F2, each bird's phenotype combines both traits. So the actual phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. c recessive, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, actually, if both genes are recessive, the bird will have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not an option here because the possible phenotypes are based on presence of dominant alleles. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (both dominant)\n2. Plain red (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain brown (wait, that's redundant)\n\nNo, actually, if a bird has both recessive alleles (c and b), it will have neither pigment nor body color, but in this context, that's not considered a phenotype. Instead, the presence of at least one dominant allele determines the phenotype. So the four phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. c recessive, B recessive: Plain brown? No\u2014that's not correct because if c is recessive for both genes, the bird would have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not an option here. Instead, the correct phenotypic ratios would consider the presence of dominant alleles for each gene separately. So the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene. Now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Let's define the probabilities for each trait:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- P(Pigment red) = 1 (since any C allele results in red)\n- P(Pigment plain) = 0\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- P(Brown) = 1 (any B allele results in brown)\n- P(Checkered) = 0\n\nHowever, this approach isn't directly applicable because the presence of one trait affects the phenotype without affecting the other. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this is not possible because it implies certainty, which contradicts the idea of independence. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will exhibit both traits, but the probability of each trait is certain given the dominant alleles.)\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is entirely determined by both traits. So the probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 100%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 0% (because if C is present, it must have brown)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): 100%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): 0% (same reason)\n\nThis suggests that all birds will display either checkered red or plain red or plain brown, depending on the alleles. But that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratios should reflect the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Considering the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n- Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%)\n- Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Cc (50%)\n- Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc (25%)\n- Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this grouping is incorrect because the F2 genotypes include CC, Cc, and cc. The phenotypes for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Plain brown\n\nBecause Cc results in Pigment red (since C is dominant) and checkered (since c is recessive), and cc results in Pigment plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, where:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAlternatively, written as 1 : 2 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our 1:2:1\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Hmm, 9+3+3+1=16, which is 16 birds, but my calculation shows 1:2:1, totaling 4 parts. Maybe scaled up differently.\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That's 1+3+9+3=16, but again, the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 1:2:1.\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16, but the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is different.\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 birds, but the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is different.\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds, but again, the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our expectation.\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is not matching.\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds, ratio 7:5:1:3, still not matching.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the F2 phenotypic distribution. In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (from CC)\n2. Plain red (from Cc)\n3. Plain brown (from cc)\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. Which can be represented as a 1:2:1 ratio when simplified.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match 1:2:1, except perhaps option G, which says 12:2:2:0, but that sums to 16 and doesn't follow the 1:2:1 pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as counting the number of each genotype and assigning phenotypes accordingly.\n\nIf we count the number of each genotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- CC: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc: 50% of 16 = 8\n- cc: 25% of 16 = 4\n\nThen, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red (8)\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown (4)\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are 4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts rather than percentages. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of the percentage. So, if there are 16 birds in total, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Plain red: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 4:8:4, simplifying to 1:2:1.\n\nBut none of the answer choices seem to match this exactly. Perhaps I need to revisit the original question. The user wrote:\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of counts, not percentages. If so, with 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\nTotal: 16\n\nSo the ratio is 4:8:4, which can be written as 1:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That adds up to 16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is not 1:2:1. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nOption D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16, but the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is a different pattern altogether.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 ratios. Let me double-check. In a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio under independent assumptions is indeed 1:2:1:1, which can be broken down into 1 part Checkered red, 2 parts Plain red, and 1 part Plain brown. Wait, but that would mean 1:2:1, but that sums to 4 parts. To get 16 birds, the counts would be 4, 8, 4, respectively.\n\nWait, but looking at option G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2192 12+2+2+0=16. This suggests that all 16 birds are checkered red, which can't be right because the other phenotypes exist.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken in how the phenotypes are determined. Let me reconsider:\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 3\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25%:50%:25%, or 1:2:1.\n\nTo represent this with counts for 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 2: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Phenotype 3: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nSo the ratio is 4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none of them match exactly. However, option G states \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which suggests that all 16 birds are checkered red, which contradicts our expectations. Another possibility is that the user made a mistake in the question, but I'll proceed with what I understand.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16 birds, but the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is not 1:2:1. Alternatively, option G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums to 16 but incorrectly groups the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the F2 generation. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross (Cc x cc). The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, leading to 16 birds with 4 checkered red, 8 plain red, and 4 plain brown.\n\nTherefore,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't. So let's see:\n\nThe possible phenotypic combinations are:\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, brown.\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C and b): Pigment red, checkered.\n3. C recessive, B dominant (c and B): Plain, brown.\n4. C recessive, B recessive (c and b): Plain, checkered.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, the gametes will always carry the same alleles. For example, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, while Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Thus, the F1 will receive CB from each parent, making all F1 individuals CcBb. \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (with probability 25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (with probability 50%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc (with probability 50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc (with probability 25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes. Since each bird has two traits determined by separate genes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment (C): dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n- Body color (B): dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC:\n- Pigment: C \u2192 red\n- Body color: C \u2192 brown\n\u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc:\n- Pigment: C \u2192 red\n- Body color: c \u2192 checkered\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\n3. Cc:\n- Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n\n4. cc:\n- Pigment: c \u2192 plain\n- Body color: b \u2192 checkered\n\u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two independent traits, so the presence of one does not affect the other. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for example, if a bird has C (red) and B (brown), it will have both traits: checkered red. Similarly, if it has C and b, it'll have red and checkered: plain red. If it has c and B, it'll have plain and brown: plain brown. If it has c and b, it'll have plain and checkered: plain brown? Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because if both genes are recessive, then the bird will have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not a valid option here. Wait, no\u2014the options are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n- C dominant, b recessive (C and b): Plain red\n- c dominant, B dominant (c and B): Plain brown\n- c recessive, b recessive (c and b): Plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, the phenotype depends on whether the genes are dominant or recessive. So:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- If at least one C allele, pigment (red)\n- If none, plain\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- If at least one B allele, brown\n- If none, checkered\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), Body color brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red (C), Body color checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Body color checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this seems off because in F2, each bird's phenotype combines both traits. So the actual phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. c recessive, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, actually, if both genes are recessive, the bird will have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not an option here because the possible phenotypes are based on presence of dominant alleles. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (both dominant)\n2. Plain red (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain brown (wait, that's redundant)\n\nNo, actually, if a bird has both recessive alleles (c and b), it will have neither pigment nor body color, but in this context, that's not considered a phenotype. Instead, the presence of at least one dominant allele determines the phenotype. So the four phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain brown\n4. c recessive, B recessive: Plain brown? No\u2014that's not correct because if c is recessive for both genes, the bird would have neither pigment nor body color, but that's not an option here. Instead, the correct phenotypic ratios would consider the presence of dominant alleles for each gene separately. So the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene. Now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Let's define the probabilities for each trait:\n\nFor Pigment (C):\n- P(Pigment red) = 1 (since any C allele results in red)\n- P(Pigment plain) = 0\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- P(Brown) = 1 (any B allele results in brown)\n- P(Checkered) = 0\n\nHowever, this approach isn't directly applicable because the presence of one trait affects the phenotype without affecting the other. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this is not possible because it implies certainty, which contradicts the idea of independence. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will exhibit both traits, but the probability of each trait is certain given the dominant alleles.)\n\nActually, each bird's phenotype is entirely determined by both traits. So the probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 100%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 0% (because if C is present, it must have brown)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): 100%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): 0% (same reason)\n\nThis suggests that all birds will display either checkered red or plain red or plain brown, depending on the alleles. But that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratios should reflect the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Considering the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n- Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%)\n- Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Cc (50%)\n- Same as above \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc (25%)\n- Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this grouping is incorrect because the F2 genotypes include CC, Cc, and cc. The phenotypes for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Plain brown\n\nBecause Cc results in Pigment red (since C is dominant) and checkered (since c is recessive), and cc results in Pigment plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, where:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nAlternatively, written as 1 : 2 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our 1:2:1\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Hmm, 9+3+3+1=16, which is 16 birds, but my calculation shows 1:2:1, totaling 4 parts. Maybe scaled up differently.\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 That's 1+3+9+3=16, but again, the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which doesn't align with our 1:2:1.\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16, but the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is different.\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 birds, but the ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is different.\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 birds, but again, the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our expectation.\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is not matching.\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 birds, ratio 7:5:1:3, still not matching.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the F2 phenotypic distribution. In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (from CC)\n2. Plain red (from Cc)\n3. Plain brown (from cc)\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Plain brown. Which can be represented as a 1:2:1 ratio when simplified.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match 1:2:1, except perhaps option G, which says 12:2:2:0, but that sums to 16 and doesn't follow the 1:2:1 pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as counting the number of each genotype and assigning phenotypes accordingly.\n\nIf we count the number of each genotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- CC: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc: 50% of 16 = 8\n- cc: 25% of 16 = 4\n\nThen, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red (8)\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown (4)\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are 4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts rather than percentages. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question refers to the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of the percentage. So, if there are 16 birds in total, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Plain red: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 4:8:4, simplifying to 1:2:1.\n\nBut none of the answer choices seem to match this exactly. Perhaps I need to revisit the original question. The user wrote:\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nPerhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio expressed in terms of counts, not percentages. If so, with 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\nTotal: 16\n\nSo the ratio is 4:8:4, which can be written as 1:2:1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That adds up to 16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is not 1:2:1. Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which sums to 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nOption D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16, but the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is a different pattern altogether.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 ratios. Let me double-check. In a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio under independent assumptions is indeed 1:2:1:1, which can be broken down into 1 part Checkered red, 2 parts Plain red, and 1 part Plain brown. Wait, but that would mean 1:2:1, but that sums to 4 parts. To get 16 birds, the counts would be 4, 8, 4, respectively.\n\nWait, but looking at option G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2192 12+2+2+0=16. This suggests that all 16 birds are checkered red, which can't be right because the other phenotypes exist.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken in how the phenotypes are determined. Let me reconsider:\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 3\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25%:50%:25%, or 1:2:1.\n\nTo represent this with counts for 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype 2: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Phenotype 3: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nSo the ratio is 4:8:4, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none of them match exactly. However, option G states \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which suggests that all 16 birds are checkered red, which contradicts our expectations. Another possibility is that the user made a mistake in the question, but I'll proceed with what I understand.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16 birds, but the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is not 1:2:1. Alternatively, option G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums to 16 but incorrectly groups the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the F2 generation. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross (Cc x cc). The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, leading to 16 birds with 4 checkered red, 8 plain red, and 4 plain brown.\n\nTherefore,",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, the other trait may or may not be expressed, depending on the dominance hierarchy.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, the other trait may or may not be expressed, depending on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, no, actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red. Similarly, for body color, at least one B allele makes it brown. So the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes results in those traits being expressed. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): This happens when the bird has at least one C but no B (i.e., b).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): This happens when the bird has no C (c) but at least one B (B).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): This happens when the bird has neither C nor B (c and b).\n\nSo now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. The F2 generation is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself, so each gene segregates independently. Each gene has a 50% chance of passing on either allele. So for each gene, the possible gametes are: C (50%), c (50%) for the C locus; and B (50%), b (50%) for the B locus. Therefore, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (probability 25%)\n- cc BB (probability 25%)\n- cc Bb (probability 25%)\n\nNow, let's map these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, so the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, totaling 4 parts. But wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance hierarchy. For example, does the presence of a dominant allele always mask the other? No, dominance refers to whether the allele is expressed regardless of others. So the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed.\n\nTherefore, each of the four phenotypes indeed occurs with equal probability (25% each), leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I've derived. Alternatively, perhaps the original question was misinterpreted regarding the genes' roles. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user mentioned: - Checkered pattern is due to gene c, which is recessive.\n- Plain color is due to gene c, which is recessive.\n- Red color is due to gene B, which is dominant.\n- Brown color is due to gene b, which is recessive.\n\nWait, hold on! The user wrote:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nCheckered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\nSo, correcting myself: \n\n- B is dominant (red)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\n- C is dominant (pigment)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the correct mapping is:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype:\n\n- C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n\n- C and b \u2192 Plain red\n\n- c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n- c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, same as before. But looking at the options, none directly state that. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums up to 16 (but divided into 6+2+6+2=16, but the actual count isn't matching our expectation). Wait, perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect in the way the F2 is being considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of each type of bird rather than phenotypes. Let me reread the question carefully.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio and other aspects like genotypes and genotypic frequencies. So, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant): Pigment red\n- c (recessive): Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (dominant): Brown\n- b (recessive): Checkered\n\nSo, each bird will have a combination of these traits. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, to determine the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use a Punnett square. Each gene segregates independently, so we'll create a grid where each row represents the alleles from one parent (CcBb) and each column the alleles from the other parent (CcBb). However, since both parents are the same, the Punnett square will consist of the products of their gametes.\n\nEach gene has alleles C and c, and B and b. The possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance. The Punnett square will thus have four possible F2 genotypes, each producing a certain number of birds in the F1 generation, but since the question is about the F2, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that F1 is CcBb, the F2 will be the squares formed by pairing these gametes. Each F2 bird will have the combined alleles from two F1 parents. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to determine how many of each phenotype occur among the F2 population.\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of being Checkered red (C and B) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But that seems off because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The presence of a dominant allele masks the recessive one, so the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or at least one dominant allele for color (B). Thus, the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, hence 25% each. Summing up, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer options reflect this. Looking at the options, option D states a ratio of 1,3,9,3 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown respectively. That suggests a different calculation method, possibly considering the number of each trait rather than the actual bird counts.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, not the proportion. In that case, the F2 generation would have a certain number of each phenotype. Let's try calculating the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and thus a 25% chance of each phenotype. Assuming a large population, the number of each phenotype would be approximately 25% of the total. However, the options don't align with this either. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but that doesn't fit the given information.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, the user provided a detailed list of gametes and F1 squares, but perhaps the F2 generation involves multiple generations, but in reality, the F2 comes from F1 selfing. However, the user's initial setup seems to describe the F1 and F2 correctly. So perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the F2 generation is actually the F1 selfed twice, but the user presented the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1. Therefore, proceeding under that assumption.\n\nIf F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, looking at the options, option D mentions a ratio of 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. That suggests that perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds rather than the proportion. For instance, if there are 16 birds in total, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 9 birds\n- Plain brown: 3 birds\n\nThis totals to 16 birds. How could that happen? Let me see. If each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, but perhaps the counts are arranged in a way that combines multiple genotypes into the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the user mistakenly included F2 in the question.\n\nAssuming the question is about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which matches option A. However, option A lists 6,2,6,2, which sum to 16, suggesting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring, not the proportion. For example, if the F1 is crossed with itself, the F2 would have a certain number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. Suppose we are only looking at the F2 generation after two selfings. Then, the F2 would consist of F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation. However, this doesn't match any of the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the user mixed up the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E is 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16. That would imply a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for two gene interactions, but in this case, each bird has two independent traits. Maybe the user confused the F2 ratio with something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, considering the possible combinations. Let me attempt to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, there are 16 possible genotypes (as each gene segregates independently into two alleles, leading to 4^2 = 16 possible combinations). These correspond to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: C and B \u2192 1 genotype (CB)\n2. Plain red: C and b \u2192 1 genotype (Cb)\n3. Checkered brown: c and B \u2192 1 genotype (cB)\n4. Plain brown: c and b \u2192 1 genotype (cb)\n\nHowever, each phenotype corresponds to multiple genotypes. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 1) includes all genotypes with C and B, which is 1 genotype (CB)\n- Plain red (phenotype 2) includes all genotypes with C but not B, which is 4 genotypes (CB, Cb, cB, cb) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C but not B, it would have genotype CB (C and B), CB (same as above?), no\u2014I'm getting confused. Wait, no\u2014a bird with C and B is Checkered red, while a bird with C and b is Plain red. So the genotypes contributing to each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: All genotypes with C (C_B_, C_bb, c_BB, c_bbb?) Wait, no, in terms of gametes, each bird has a genotype consisting of two alleles for each gene. So for the C gene, any C allele means red pigment, and for the B gene, any B allele means brown color.\n\nThus, for the C gene:\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n- Plain red (C_ and bb)\n- Checkered brown (cc and B_)\n- Plain brown (cc and bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 16 birds. Each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, so:\n\n- Number of Checkered red birds (C_ and B_): 4 (genotypes: CB, Cb, cB, cb)\n- Number of Plain red birds (C_ and bb): 4 (genotypes: Cb, cB, CB, cb)\n- Number of Checkered brown birds (cc and B_): 4 (genotypes: B_, bB, Bb, bB)\n- Number of Plain brown birds (cc and bb): 4 (genotypes: bb, bB, Bb, bB)\n\nWait, that would mean each phenotype has 4 birds, making a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match this. Looking back, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of birds. If the F2 generation is from F1 \u00d7 F1, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation (assuming two loci are independent). However, this doesn't explain the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to refer to the F1 generation, not F2. If so, the F1 generation would be 1:1:1:1, matching option A. But option A shows 6,2,6,2, which adds to 16. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in indicating F2 as the generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring, not the proportion.\n\nAnother angle: the user provided a detailed F1 \u00d7 F1 table showing the possible gametes and their frequencies. From this, the F1 generation would have four possible genotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. The phenotypic ratio for F1 would still be 1:1:1:1, as each trait is equally likely. However, the options suggest otherwise. Option D claims a ratio of 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 and suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which typically applies to two loci without interference. But in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 generation should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Yet, option D doesn't match this either.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, assuming each bird contributes to the next generation. However, this line of reasoning doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly labeled, and it's asking about the F1 generation instead of the F2. If that were the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, matching option A. But option A's numbers are 6,2,6,2, which add up to 16, implying six of one phenotype, two of another, etc. That doesn't align with the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial understanding. Let me clarify: The question is about a dihybrid cross (two genes) and specifically the F2 generation. The options provided seem to represent various phenotypic ratios, including those from a two-gene interaction. However, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 generation should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Among the options, none match this exactly, except perhaps if the user made a mistake in the question setup.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, matching option A. However, none of the options directly state 1:1:1:1. Option D, for example, mentions 1,3,9,3, which is characteristic of a two-gene interaction without interference, such as in a test cross or a trihybrid cross. But in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the user expects an answer, I'll have to choose the closest option, which might be option D. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something crucial. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring produced, not the proportion. For example, if the F2 generation results in 9 birds with Checkered red, 3 with Plain red, 3 with Checkered brown, and 1 with Plain brown, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But this is typical for a two-gene interaction without interference, such as in a test cross. However, in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, the other trait may or may not be expressed, depending on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, no, actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red. Similarly, for body color, at least one B allele makes it brown. So the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes results in those traits being expressed. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): This happens when the bird has at least one C but no B (i.e., b).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): This happens when the bird has no C (c) but at least one B (B).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): This happens when the bird has neither C nor B (c and b).\n\nSo now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. The F2 generation is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself, so each gene segregates independently. Each gene has a 50% chance of passing on either allele. So for each gene, the possible gametes are: C (50%), c (50%) for the C locus; and B (50%), b (50%) for the B locus. Therefore, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (probability 25%)\n- cc BB (probability 25%)\n- cc Bb (probability 25%)\n\nNow, let's map these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, so the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, totaling 4 parts. But wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance hierarchy. For example, does the presence of a dominant allele always mask the other? No, dominance refers to whether the allele is expressed regardless of others. So the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed.\n\nTherefore, each of the four phenotypes indeed occurs with equal probability (25% each), leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I've derived. Alternatively, perhaps the original question was misinterpreted regarding the genes' roles. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user mentioned: - Checkered pattern is due to gene c, which is recessive.\n- Plain color is due to gene c, which is recessive.\n- Red color is due to gene B, which is dominant.\n- Brown color is due to gene b, which is recessive.\n\nWait, hold on! The user wrote:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nCheckered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\nSo, correcting myself: \n\n- B is dominant (red)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\n- C is dominant (pigment)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the correct mapping is:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype:\n\n- C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n\n- C and b \u2192 Plain red\n\n- c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n\n- c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, same as before. But looking at the options, none directly state that. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums up to 16 (but divided into 6+2+6+2=16, but the actual count isn't matching our expectation). Wait, perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect in the way the F2 is being considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of each type of bird rather than phenotypes. Let me reread the question carefully.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio and other aspects like genotypes and genotypic frequencies. So, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant): Pigment red\n- c (recessive): Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (dominant): Brown\n- b (recessive): Checkered\n\nSo, each bird will have a combination of these traits. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nNow, to determine the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can use a Punnett square. Each gene segregates independently, so we'll create a grid where each row represents the alleles from one parent (CcBb) and each column the alleles from the other parent (CcBb). However, since both parents are the same, the Punnett square will consist of the products of their gametes.\n\nEach gene has alleles C and c, and B and b. The possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance. The Punnett square will thus have four possible F2 genotypes, each producing a certain number of birds in the F1 generation, but since the question is about the F2, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that F1 is CcBb, the F2 will be the squares formed by pairing these gametes. Each F2 bird will have the combined alleles from two F1 parents. To find the phenotypic ratio, we need to determine how many of each phenotype occur among the F2 population.\n\nSince each gene is segregating independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of being Checkered red (C and B) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But that seems off because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The presence of a dominant allele masks the recessive one, so the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or at least one dominant allele for color (B). Thus, the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, hence 25% each. Summing up, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer options reflect this. Looking at the options, option D states a ratio of 1,3,9,3 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown respectively. That suggests a different calculation method, possibly considering the number of each trait rather than the actual bird counts.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, not the proportion. In that case, the F2 generation would have a certain number of each phenotype. Let's try calculating the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and thus a 25% chance of each phenotype. Assuming a large population, the number of each phenotype would be approximately 25% of the total. However, the options don't align with this either. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but that doesn't fit the given information.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, the user provided a detailed list of gametes and F1 squares, but perhaps the F2 generation involves multiple generations, but in reality, the F2 comes from F1 selfing. However, the user's initial setup seems to describe the F1 and F2 correctly. So perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the F2 generation is actually the F1 selfed twice, but the user presented the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1. Therefore, proceeding under that assumption.\n\nIf F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. However, looking at the options, option D mentions a ratio of 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. That suggests that perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds rather than the proportion. For instance, if there are 16 birds in total, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Checkered brown: 9 birds\n- Plain brown: 3 birds\n\nThis totals to 16 birds. How could that happen? Let me see. If each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, but perhaps the counts are arranged in a way that combines multiple genotypes into the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but the user mistakenly included F2 in the question.\n\nAssuming the question is about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which matches option A. However, option A lists 6,2,6,2, which sum to 16, suggesting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring, not the proportion. For example, if the F1 is crossed with itself, the F2 would have a certain number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. Suppose we are only looking at the F2 generation after two selfings. Then, the F2 would consist of F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation. However, this doesn't match any of the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps the user mixed up the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E is 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16. That would imply a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for two gene interactions, but in this case, each bird has two independent traits. Maybe the user confused the F2 ratio with something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, considering the possible combinations. Let me attempt to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, there are 16 possible genotypes (as each gene segregates independently into two alleles, leading to 4^2 = 16 possible combinations). These correspond to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: C and B \u2192 1 genotype (CB)\n2. Plain red: C and b \u2192 1 genotype (Cb)\n3. Checkered brown: c and B \u2192 1 genotype (cB)\n4. Plain brown: c and b \u2192 1 genotype (cb)\n\nHowever, each phenotype corresponds to multiple genotypes. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 1) includes all genotypes with C and B, which is 1 genotype (CB)\n- Plain red (phenotype 2) includes all genotypes with C but not B, which is 4 genotypes (CB, Cb, cB, cb) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C but not B, it would have genotype CB (C and B), CB (same as above?), no\u2014I'm getting confused. Wait, no\u2014a bird with C and B is Checkered red, while a bird with C and b is Plain red. So the genotypes contributing to each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: All genotypes with C (C_B_, C_bb, c_BB, c_bbb?) Wait, no, in terms of gametes, each bird has a genotype consisting of two alleles for each gene. So for the C gene, any C allele means red pigment, and for the B gene, any B allele means brown color.\n\nThus, for the C gene:\n\n- C_: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n- Plain red (C_ and bb)\n- Checkered brown (cc and B_)\n- Plain brown (cc and bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 16 birds. Each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, so:\n\n- Number of Checkered red birds (C_ and B_): 4 (genotypes: CB, Cb, cB, cb)\n- Number of Plain red birds (C_ and bb): 4 (genotypes: Cb, cB, CB, cb)\n- Number of Checkered brown birds (cc and B_): 4 (genotypes: B_, bB, Bb, bB)\n- Number of Plain brown birds (cc and bb): 4 (genotypes: bb, bB, Bb, bB)\n\nWait, that would mean each phenotype has 4 birds, making a ratio of 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match this. Looking back, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of birds. If the F2 generation is from F1 \u00d7 F1, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation (assuming two loci are independent). However, this doesn't explain the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to refer to the F1 generation, not F2. If so, the F1 generation would be 1:1:1:1, matching option A. But option A shows 6,2,6,2, which adds to 16. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in indicating F2 as the generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring, not the proportion.\n\nAnother angle: the user provided a detailed F1 \u00d7 F1 table showing the possible gametes and their frequencies. From this, the F1 generation would have four possible genotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. The phenotypic ratio for F1 would still be 1:1:1:1, as each trait is equally likely. However, the options suggest otherwise. Option D claims a ratio of 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 and suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which typically applies to two loci without interference. But in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 generation should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Yet, option D doesn't match this either.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds, assuming each bird contributes to the next generation. However, this line of reasoning doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly labeled, and it's asking about the F1 generation instead of the F2. If that were the case, the F1 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, matching option A. But option A's numbers are 6,2,6,2, which add up to 16, implying six of one phenotype, two of another, etc. That doesn't align with the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial understanding. Let me clarify: The question is about a dihybrid cross (two genes) and specifically the F2 generation. The options provided seem to represent various phenotypic ratios, including those from a two-gene interaction. However, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 generation should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Among the options, none match this exactly, except perhaps if the user made a mistake in the question setup.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, matching option A. However, none of the options directly state 1:1:1:1. Option D, for example, mentions 1,3,9,3, which is characteristic of a two-gene interaction without interference, such as in a test cross or a trihybrid cross. But in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the user expects an answer, I'll have to choose the closest option, which might be option D. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something crucial. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of offspring produced, not the proportion. For example, if the F2 generation results in 9 birds with Checkered red, 3 with Plain red, 3 with Checkered brown, and 1 with Plain brown, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But this is typical for a two-gene interaction without interference, such as in a test cross. However, in this case, each bird has two independent traits, so the F2 ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't be expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): All such birds will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive): These will express red pigment but not brown.\n3. Plain (c dominant) and brown (B dominant): Plain body but brown color.\n4. Plain (c dominant) and checkered (B recessive): Both plain.\n\nSo now, to find the number of each phenotype in the F2 population, we'll use the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Since the genes are independent, we can model the distribution accordingly. Each bird has four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations. But many of these will overlap. Instead, it's easier to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. In reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color, the presence of at least one dominant C allele results in red pigment. Similarly, for body color, the presence of at least one dominant B allele results in brown. So, the phenotypic classes are determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nLet me re-express the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 all birds with C and B\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 plain body, brown color\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 plain body, checkered\n\nNow, to compute the probability of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C gives red pigment)\nWait, no\u2014wait, actually, the presence of at least one C allele determines pigment red. So, the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 minus the probability that both alleles are recessive (c c). Since each parent contributes a c allele with 50%, the probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So P(red) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- P(brown) = 1 - P(bb) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for example, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is P(red) * P(brown) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having red pigment and checkered is P(red) * P(not brown) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having plain (c) and brown is P(not red) * P(brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of having plain (c) and checkered is P(not red) * P(not brown) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the four phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Red and Brown: 9/16\n2. Red and Checkered: 3/16\n3. Checkered and Brown: 3/16\n4. Checkered and Checkered: 1/16\n\nTo get the actual counts, we'd look at the total number of F2 individuals, say N. Then:\n\n1. N * 9/16\n2. N * 3/16\n3. N * 3/16\n4. N * 1/16\n\nThese add up to N*(9+3+3+1)/16 = N*16/16 = N, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 (Red, brown, checkered, checkered)\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nFrom my calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't be expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): All such birds will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive): These will express red pigment but not brown.\n3. Plain (c dominant) and brown (B dominant): Plain body but brown color.\n4. Plain (c dominant) and checkered (B recessive): Both plain.\n\nSo now, to find the number of each phenotype in the F2 population, we'll use the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Since the genes are independent, we can model the distribution accordingly. Each bird has four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations. But many of these will overlap. Instead, it's easier to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. In reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color, the presence of at least one dominant C allele results in red pigment. Similarly, for body color, the presence of at least one dominant B allele results in brown. So, the phenotypic classes are determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nLet me re-express the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 all birds with C and B\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red pigment, plain body\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B dominant) \u2192 plain body, brown color\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (B recessive) \u2192 plain body, checkered\n\nNow, to compute the probability of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C gives red pigment)\nWait, no\u2014wait, actually, the presence of at least one C allele determines pigment red. So, the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 minus the probability that both alleles are recessive (c c). Since each parent contributes a c allele with 50%, the probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So P(red) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- P(brown) = 1 - P(bb) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for example, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is P(red) * P(brown) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having red pigment and checkered is P(red) * P(not brown) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having plain (c) and brown is P(not red) * P(brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd the probability of having plain (c) and checkered is P(not red) * P(not brown) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the four phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Red and Brown: 9/16\n2. Red and Checkered: 3/16\n3. Checkered and Brown: 3/16\n4. Checkered and Checkered: 1/16\n\nTo get the actual counts, we'd look at the total number of F2 individuals, say N. Then:\n\n1. N * 9/16\n2. N * 3/16\n3. N * 3/16\n4. N * 1/16\n\nThese add up to N*(9+3+3+1)/16 = N*16/16 = N, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 (Red, brown, checkered, checkered)\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nFrom my calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and B is present (brown). So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's find the probability for each phenotype.\n\nEach bird must inherit one allele from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 will be CcBb, as previously established.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb):\n- The C locus will determine pigment color: dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- The B locus will determine body color: dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 50% for the dominant allele and 50% for the recessive allele. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B)\nP = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right. Because if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, actually, the probability of each phenotype isn't just 1, but rather the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor each bird:\n- Probability of pigment red (C): 1 (since any C makes it red)\n- Probability of brown (B): 1 (since any B makes it brown)\nSo, the probability of having both traits is 1 * 1 = 1 (100%), but that seems off because it implies all birds have both traits. That's not correct. Instead, the correct way is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. Since both genes are dominant, all birds will have both traits. Wait, but that contradicts reality, where some birds don't have one trait unless they have the corresponding dominant allele. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try another method. Using a Punnett square for the two genes, considering each gene separately, then combining them.\n\nFor the C locus (p = C, q = c):\n\nParent 1 contributes C (as both alleles are C)\nParent 2 contributes c (both alleles are c)\n\nSo the F1 will have C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. Thus, in terms of pigment color, the F1 will have a 50% chance of having pigment red (C) and 50% chance of having plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (p = B, q = b):\n\nParent 1 contributes B (both alleles are B)\nParent 2 contributes b (both alleles are b)\n\nThus, the F1 will have B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. So, in terms of body color, the F1 will have a 50% chance of being brown (B) and 50% chance of being checkered (b).\n\nSince the two genes are acting independently, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nSo, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. But looking back at the options, none of them match exactly, except option A says \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options seem to suggest different counts. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait! The question is asking for the F2 generation, but the initial setup mentions adi hybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps the F1 is correct, but what's needed is the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation after crossing the F1 (which is CcBb) with itself, leading to F2 as described in the problem. In that case, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency (25% each), resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not include such a ratio. Looking at the options, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which sums up to 16, but according to our calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 4 parts each totaling 16. None of the options match this exact pheno ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their options. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is expressed differently. Alternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the options given do not reflect that. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio but scaled up by 1/16.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 total, also 1:1:0:1, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 total, which would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, but that would correspond to a dihybrid cross without any dominance issues, implying that both genes are dominant. However, in this case, both genes have incomplete dominance, so the 9:3:3:1 wouldn't apply. Instead, the observed ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misapplied something. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but perhaps the question is about the F2 in relation to a dihybrid cross starting from F1. Let me clarify: the initial question is about an adi hybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the F1 is formed, and the F2 is considered. Perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 crossed with F1. So, F2 would be the F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself (CcBb). In that case, the F2 would have four phenotypes, each with a certain number of individuals. \n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can use a Punnett square. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 will have a grid where each gamete combines with every other gamete. However, instead of enumerating all 16 combinations, we can group them by phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C: pigment red\n- Absence of C: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B: checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in F2 depends on the number of ways each combination can occur. Since each F1 can produce four gametes, each with equal likelihood (25%), the F2 will have:\n\nFor each combination of C and B:\n- The probability of having C (0.5) and B (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- C (0.5) and b (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- c (0.5) and B (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- c (0.5) and b (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, meaning in a population of, say, 16 birds, 4 would be each phenotype. However, the options given do not match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at Option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Summing to 16, with each phenotype occurring roughly 1/16th of the time. But according to our calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% (1/4) of the time, which is 4 in a 16 population.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option E has 9,3,1,3, which adds up to 16. Let me see how this could come about. If each phenotype occurred 9 times for checkered red, 3 for checkered brown, etc., that's inconsistent with our previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the F2 generation, but perhaps it's referring to the F1 generation, which is CcBb, and their phenotypes. However, the options provided do not align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, and the correct answer is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: The adi hybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the F1 is formed, and the F2 is analyzed. The user provided a detailed setup of gametes and a F2 Punnett square. However, the question now asks for the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation, which, based on our analysis, should be 1:1:1:1. But the options do not include this exact pheno ratio. The closest option is E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, suggesting a 1:1:0:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation, but the question specifically mentions F2. Without further information, I think the correct approach is to select the option that reflects a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since none of the options provide this, perhaps the intended answer was E, but I'm unsure.\n\nGiven the confusion and the lack of matching options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, perhaps the closest is E, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 as well, but that's also not reflected in the options.\n\nAnother possibility is that I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me verify the probabilities once again.\n\nEach gene is independent, and each bird inherits one allele from each parent. For C locus:\n- Parent 1: C (both alleles)\n- Parent 2: c (both alleles)\nThus, F1 has C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. So, for pigment color, 50% C (red) and 50% c (plain).\n\nFor B locus:\n- Parent 1: B (both alleles)\n- Parent 2: b (both alleles)\nThus, F1 has B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. So, for body color, 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered).\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B. Since each gene acts independently, the four phenotypes each have a probability of 25%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. However, since the options don't include this, I might need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the F1 generation, which would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the user confused F1 and F2, and expects the F2 ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option. \n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll assume that the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, but based on the 25% probabilities, I'm leaning towards E, though I'm uncertain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's find the probability for each phenotype.\n\nEach bird must inherit one allele from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 will be CcBb, as previously established.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb):\n- The C locus will determine pigment color: dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- The B locus will determine body color: dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 50% for the dominant allele and 50% for the recessive allele. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B)\nP = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right. Because if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, actually, the probability of each phenotype isn't just 1, but rather the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor each bird:\n- Probability of pigment red (C): 1 (since any C makes it red)\n- Probability of brown (B): 1 (since any B makes it brown)\nSo, the probability of having both traits is 1 * 1 = 1 (100%), but that seems off because it implies all birds have both traits. That's not correct. Instead, the correct way is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. Since both genes are dominant, all birds will have both traits. Wait, but that contradicts reality, where some birds don't have one trait unless they have the corresponding dominant allele. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try another method. Using a Punnett square for the two genes, considering each gene separately, then combining them.\n\nFor the C locus (p = C, q = c):\n\nParent 1 contributes C (as both alleles are C)\nParent 2 contributes c (both alleles are c)\n\nSo the F1 will have C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. Thus, in terms of pigment color, the F1 will have a 50% chance of having pigment red (C) and 50% chance of having plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (p = B, q = b):\n\nParent 1 contributes B (both alleles are B)\nParent 2 contributes b (both alleles are b)\n\nThus, the F1 will have B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. So, in terms of body color, the F1 will have a 50% chance of being brown (B) and 50% chance of being checkered (b).\n\nSince the two genes are acting independently, the overall probabilities for each phenotype are the products of the individual probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nSo, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. But looking back at the options, none of them match exactly, except option A says \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options seem to suggest different counts. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait! The question is asking for the F2 generation, but the initial setup mentions adi hybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps the F1 is correct, but what's needed is the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation after crossing the F1 (which is CcBb) with itself, leading to F2 as described in the problem. In that case, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency (25% each), resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options provided do not include such a ratio. Looking at the options, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which sums up to 16, but according to our calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 4 parts each totaling 16. None of the options match this exact pheno ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their options. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is expressed differently. Alternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the options given do not reflect that. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio but scaled up by 1/16.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16 total, also 1:1:0:1, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16 total, which would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, but that would correspond to a dihybrid cross without any dominance issues, implying that both genes are dominant. However, in this case, both genes have incomplete dominance, so the 9:3:3:1 wouldn't apply. Instead, the observed ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misapplied something. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but perhaps the question is about the F2 in relation to a dihybrid cross starting from F1. Let me clarify: the initial question is about an adi hybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the F1 is formed, and the F2 is considered. Perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 crossed with F1. So, F2 would be the F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself (CcBb). In that case, the F2 would have four phenotypes, each with a certain number of individuals. \n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can use a Punnett square. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 will have a grid where each gamete combines with every other gamete. However, instead of enumerating all 16 combinations, we can group them by phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence of C: pigment red\n- Absence of C: plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence of B: brown\n- Absence of B: checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in F2 depends on the number of ways each combination can occur. Since each F1 can produce four gametes, each with equal likelihood (25%), the F2 will have:\n\nFor each combination of C and B:\n- The probability of having C (0.5) and B (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- C (0.5) and b (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- c (0.5) and B (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- c (0.5) and b (0.5) is 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nTherefore, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, meaning in a population of, say, 16 birds, 4 would be each phenotype. However, the options given do not match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at Option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Summing to 16, with each phenotype occurring roughly 1/16th of the time. But according to our calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% (1/4) of the time, which is 4 in a 16 population.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option E has 9,3,1,3, which adds up to 16. Let me see how this could come about. If each phenotype occurred 9 times for checkered red, 3 for checkered brown, etc., that's inconsistent with our previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the F2 generation, but perhaps it's referring to the F1 generation, which is CcBb, and their phenotypes. However, the options provided do not align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, and the correct answer is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: The adi hybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the F1 is formed, and the F2 is analyzed. The user provided a detailed setup of gametes and a F2 Punnett square. However, the question now asks for the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation, which, based on our analysis, should be 1:1:1:1. But the options do not include this exact pheno ratio. The closest option is E, which has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, suggesting a 1:1:0:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation, but the question specifically mentions F2. Without further information, I think the correct approach is to select the option that reflects a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since none of the options provide this, perhaps the intended answer was E, but I'm unsure.\n\nGiven the confusion and the lack of matching options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, perhaps the closest is E, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, which would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 as well, but that's also not reflected in the options.\n\nAnother possibility is that I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me verify the probabilities once again.\n\nEach gene is independent, and each bird inherits one allele from each parent. For C locus:\n- Parent 1: C (both alleles)\n- Parent 2: c (both alleles)\nThus, F1 has C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. So, for pigment color, 50% C (red) and 50% c (plain).\n\nFor B locus:\n- Parent 1: B (both alleles)\n- Parent 2: b (both alleles)\nThus, F1 has B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. So, for body color, 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered).\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B. Since each gene acts independently, the four phenotypes each have a probability of 25%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1 across all four phenotypes. However, since the options don't include this, I might need to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the F1 generation, which would indeed have a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, maybe the user confused F1 and F2, and expects the F2 ratio, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option. \n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll assume that the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, but based on the 25% probabilities, I'm leaning towards E, though I'm uncertain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But since both parents are homozygous for their respective dominant traits, all F2 offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene.",
    "rollout": " But since both parents are homozygous for their respective dominant traits, all F2 offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, no, because F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the F2 will have a 25% chance of CC (all C), 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. So for pigment color (C): \n- All CC and Cc will have pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- Only cc will have plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- All BB and Bb will have brown (dominant B)\n- Only bb will have plain brown (recessive b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these two traits. Since each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. \n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Not possible, as all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, that seems off. Because in reality, for each bird, the presence of the dominant allele is required for the trait to manifest. So for pigment color, all birds have either C (red) or c (plain). Similarly, for body color, all birds have either B (brown) or b (checkered). Since the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both traits expressed (probability 1, but this isn't practical as it's certain)\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered)\n- Plain and brown: c (plain) and B dominant (brown)\n- Plain and checkered: c (plain) and B recessive (checkered)\n\nSince all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (only possible if C and B are both present, but since C is always present, this is Pigmented red and Brown)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and checkered (C and B absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: Probability is 1 (for C) * 1 (for B) = 1 \u2192 Not possible, as it's certain. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all F2 birds will have both traits. That can't be right because the options suggest different ratios. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. So in this case, regardless of the other gene, if a bird has C, it will have pigment red. Similarly, if it has B, it'll have brown. Since all F2 have at least one C and one B, all F2 birds will have both traits. Wait, that contradicts the given answer choices, where the ratios don't include zero for any phenotype. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). Each trait is determined by one gene, and the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding trait.\n\nSo, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it needs at least one dominant allele for each gene. However, in this case, since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene (because all parents are homozygous for dominant alleles), every F2 bird will have both traits expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking at the answer options, none of them have equal ratios. That suggests I might have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous for dominant alleles. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive. So their F1 should be CcBb, and then F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to the answer options, the closest would be option D, which has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that's not matching our expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, let me double-check the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So both parents are homozygous for dominant C and dominant B. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and F2 follows 25% each of CC, Cc, cc, bb. But applying the two-trait model, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express both traits. So, all F2 birds will have both traits, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps the issue lies elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers only the expression of one trait per gene. Wait, no\u2014the question states that each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider each trait separately and then combine the ratios.\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n\n- All F2 have at least one C (since F1 is Cc), so Pigmented red is 100%.\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- All F2 have at least one B (since F1 is Bb), so Brown is 100%.\n\nThus, all F2 birds have both traits, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, this isn't matching the answer options provided. Looking back at the answer options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16, but my calculation was 16 phenotypes, but the sum should be 16. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also sums to 16. But none of the options seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance applies differently. In many cases, the presence of one dominant allele overrides the other. So, for pigment color, if an animal has at least one C, it's Pigmented red. If it has at least one B, it's Brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (at least one C)\n2. Brown (at least one B)\n3. Checkered (no C and no B)\nBut wait, if the bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits, i.e., Pigmented red and Brown. If it has at least one C but no B, it'll have Pigmented red and Checkered. If it has no C but at least one B, it'll have Plain (since c is recessive) and Brown. And finally, if neither C nor B is present, it'll have Plain and Checkered.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), independent of the other.\n\nThe probability of having at least one C (Pigmented red) is 1 minus the probability of having no C, which is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So P(Pigmented red) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one B (Brown) is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the presence of both traits ensures that both are present, the combined probability of having both is higher than simply multiplying the individual probabilities. Instead, we should use the formula for the probability of both events occurring: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A).\n\nIn this case, since the presence of C and B are independent, P(Pigmented red and Brown) = P(Pigmented red) * P(Brown | Pigmented red) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThen, P(Pigmented red and Checkered) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nP(Plain and Brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nP(Plain and Checkered) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total number of possible phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, option G states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that aligns with our calculations. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since both parents are homozygous for their respective dominant traits, all F2 offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Wait, no, because F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the F2 will have a 25% chance of CC (all C), 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. So for pigment color (C): \n- All CC and Cc will have pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- Only cc will have plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- All BB and Bb will have brown (dominant B)\n- Only bb will have plain brown (recessive b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these two traits. Since each gene acts independently, the phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. \n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Not possible, as all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, that seems off. Because in reality, for each bird, the presence of the dominant allele is required for the trait to manifest. So for pigment color, all birds have either C (red) or c (plain). Similarly, for body color, all birds have either B (brown) or b (checkered). Since the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both traits expressed (probability 1, but this isn't practical as it's certain)\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered)\n- Plain and brown: c (plain) and B dominant (brown)\n- Plain and checkered: c (plain) and B recessive (checkered)\n\nSince all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (only possible if C and B are both present, but since C is always present, this is Pigmented red and Brown)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and checkered (C and B absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: Probability is 1 (for C) * 1 (for B) = 1 \u2192 Not possible, as it's certain. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, all F2 birds will have both traits. That can't be right because the options suggest different ratios. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the corresponding trait being expressed. So in this case, regardless of the other gene, if a bird has C, it will have pigment red. Similarly, if it has B, it'll have brown. Since all F2 have at least one C and one B, all F2 birds will have both traits. Wait, that contradicts the given answer choices, where the ratios don't include zero for any phenotype. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). Each trait is determined by one gene, and the presence of the dominant allele results in the corresponding trait.\n\nSo, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it needs at least one dominant allele for each gene. However, in this case, since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene (because all parents are homozygous for dominant alleles), every F2 bird will have both traits expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking at the answer options, none of them have equal ratios. That suggests I might have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous for dominant alleles. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive. So their F1 should be CcBb, and then F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to the answer options, the closest would be option D, which has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that's not matching our expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, let me double-check the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So both parents are homozygous for dominant C and dominant B. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and F2 follows 25% each of CC, Cc, cc, bb. But applying the two-trait model, each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express both traits. So, all F2 birds will have both traits, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps the issue lies elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers only the expression of one trait per gene. Wait, no\u2014the question states that each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider each trait separately and then combine the ratios.\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n\n- All F2 have at least one C (since F1 is Cc), so Pigmented red is 100%.\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- All F2 have at least one B (since F1 is Bb), so Brown is 100%.\n\nThus, all F2 birds have both traits, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, this isn't matching the answer options provided. Looking back at the answer options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16, but my calculation was 16 phenotypes, but the sum should be 16. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also sums to 16. But none of the options seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance applies differently. In many cases, the presence of one dominant allele overrides the other. So, for pigment color, if an animal has at least one C, it's Pigmented red. If it has at least one B, it's Brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (at least one C)\n2. Brown (at least one B)\n3. Checkered (no C and no B)\nBut wait, if the bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits, i.e., Pigmented red and Brown. If it has at least one C but no B, it'll have Pigmented red and Checkered. If it has no C but at least one B, it'll have Plain (since c is recessive) and Brown. And finally, if neither C nor B is present, it'll have Plain and Checkered.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nEach gene has two possibilities (dominant or recessive), independent of the other.\n\nThe probability of having at least one C (Pigmented red) is 1 minus the probability of having no C, which is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So P(Pigmented red) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one B (Brown) is 3/4.\n\nHowever, since the presence of both traits ensures that both are present, the combined probability of having both is higher than simply multiplying the individual probabilities. Instead, we should use the formula for the probability of both events occurring: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A).\n\nIn this case, since the presence of C and B are independent, P(Pigmented red and Brown) = P(Pigmented red) * P(Brown | Pigmented red) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThen, P(Pigmented red and Checkered) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nP(Plain and Brown) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nP(Plain and Checkered) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total number of possible phenotypes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, option G states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that aligns with our calculations. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. For example, a bird could have C dominant (red) but b recessive (checkered) for the B gene, resulting in checkered body regardless of color. Similarly, a bird could have b recessive (checkered) for B but C dominant (red) for pigment, resulting in red body. So the actual phenotypes depend on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This occurs when C is dominant (so pigment is red) and B is dominant (body is brown).\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Pigment is red (C), but body is checkered (b).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Body is brown (B), but pigment is plain (c).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Both body and pigment are plain.\n\nNow, the probability of each category is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's state.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous for each gene (their genotypes are homozygous), the gametes produced are fixed. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (the first generation after crossing the two parents) is all CcBb, and the F2 generation is formed by F1 selfing.\n\nWait, but the question says \"adahybridcross,\" but given the parents are homozygous, perhaps it's a test cross or selfing. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25% for each gene being dominant)\n- Cc (for pigment)\n- cc (for body)\n- bb (for body)\n\nEach gene acts independently, so the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's list the four possible phenotypic categories and their corresponding probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Impossible, as it implies all birds have both traits.\n   \nWait, that can't be right. Because if both genes are dominant, the bird will definitely have both traits. But according to the given options, none of them match this, which suggests that my understanding might be flawed. Perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous, but rather, the dihybrids have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Heterozygous for both genes.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So C is dominant for pigment, c is recessive. Similarly, B is dominant for brown, b is recessive. So each bird has two alleles for each gene. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the F1 selfed. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the distribution of C and B alleles. Let's create a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nParent 1 (CcBb) can produce gametes: CB and cb (each at 50%).\n\nParent 2 (CcBb) also produces gametes: CB and cb (each at 50%). Wait, no\u2014the second parent is cc bb, so all gametes are cb.\n\nAh, right, because the second parent is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: C C\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: C c\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: c C\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: c c\n\nEach combination occurs with a certain probability. Specifically, each gamete from F1 is CB (25%) and cb (75%)?\n\nWait, no. Wait, F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes:\n\n- CB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CB (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach gamete type occurs with a 25% probability because F1 produces CB and cb each at 50%, so the combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The F2 genotypes come from the F1 selfing, which results in each genotype having a certain frequency. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both loci, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply the product of the individual ratios because some combinations may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider all possible genotype combinations and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me attempt this:\n\nEach bird has four possible alleles for each gene. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant (Pigment red and Brown)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive (Pigment red, Checkered)\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant (Plain, Brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B recessive (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\n- Probability of c = 0 (but wait, in reality, each bird's C is determined by its alleles, but here, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting.)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. In a dihybrid cross, each gene is segregating independently, but the phenotypes combine both genes. Let me approach this differently. For the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible combinations of alleles for each gene and mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to its phenotype through both genes. For example, a bird with the genotype CcBb would have pigment red (C dominant) and body brown (B dominant), leading to Phenotype 1.\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can use the fact that each gene segregates independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of all allele combinations that result in that phenotype.\n\nHowever, this can get complicated, so perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross (when both parents are homozygous for both genes), the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance. However, in our case, since all alleles are dominant (as the parents are homozygous dominant and recessive), all phenotypes will appear, but the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the question states that the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), meaning all F1 will have CcBb, and F2 will be the F1 selfed. So, applying the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- Phenotype 1: All C and B dominant \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 1 part\n\nBut wait, this assumes that both genes are fully dominant, which they are in this case. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 Phenotype 1, 3 Phenotype 2, 3 Phenotype 3, 1 Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option G is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option J, which lists Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled A to J, with each option listing different ratios. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option J, which corresponds to this ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. For example, a bird could have C dominant (red) but b recessive (checkered) for the B gene, resulting in checkered body regardless of color. Similarly, a bird could have b recessive (checkered) for B but C dominant (red) for pigment, resulting in red body. So the actual phenotypes depend on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This occurs when C is dominant (so pigment is red) and B is dominant (body is brown).\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Pigment is red (C), but body is checkered (b).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Body is brown (B), but pigment is plain (c).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Both body and pigment are plain.\n\nNow, the probability of each category is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's state.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous for each gene (their genotypes are homozygous), the gametes produced are fixed. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, F1 (the first generation after crossing the two parents) is all CcBb, and the F2 generation is formed by F1 selfing.\n\nWait, but the question says \"adahybridcross,\" but given the parents are homozygous, perhaps it's a test cross or selfing. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25% for each gene being dominant)\n- Cc (for pigment)\n- cc (for body)\n- bb (for body)\n\nEach gene acts independently, so the overall probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's list the four possible phenotypic categories and their corresponding probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Impossible, as it implies all birds have both traits.\n   \nWait, that can't be right. Because if both genes are dominant, the bird will definitely have both traits. But according to the given options, none of them match this, which suggests that my understanding might be flawed. Perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous, but rather, the dihybrids have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Heterozygous for both genes.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So C is dominant for pigment, c is recessive. Similarly, B is dominant for brown, b is recessive. So each bird has two alleles for each gene. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the F1 selfed. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the distribution of C and B alleles. Let's create a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nParent 1 (CcBb) can produce gametes: CB and cb (each at 50%).\n\nParent 2 (CcBb) also produces gametes: CB and cb (each at 50%). Wait, no\u2014the second parent is cc bb, so all gametes are cb.\n\nAh, right, because the second parent is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: C C\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: C c\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: c C\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: c c\n\nEach combination occurs with a certain probability. Specifically, each gamete from F1 is CB (25%) and cb (75%)?\n\nWait, no. Wait, F1 is CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes:\n\n- CB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CB (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach gamete type occurs with a 25% probability because F1 produces CB and cb each at 50%, so the combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The F2 genotypes come from the F1 selfing, which results in each genotype having a certain frequency. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. However, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both loci, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply the product of the individual ratios because some combinations may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider all possible genotype combinations and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nLet me attempt this:\n\nEach bird has four possible alleles for each gene. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant (Pigment red and Brown)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive (Pigment red, Checkered)\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant (Plain, Brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B recessive (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\n- Probability of c = 0 (but wait, in reality, each bird's C is determined by its alleles, but here, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting.)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. In a dihybrid cross, each gene is segregating independently, but the phenotypes combine both genes. Let me approach this differently. For the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible combinations of alleles for each gene and mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to its phenotype through both genes. For example, a bird with the genotype CcBb would have pigment red (C dominant) and body brown (B dominant), leading to Phenotype 1.\n\nTo find the number of each phenotype, we can use the fact that each gene segregates independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of all allele combinations that result in that phenotype.\n\nHowever, this can get complicated, so perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross (when both parents are homozygous for both genes), the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance. However, in our case, since all alleles are dominant (as the parents are homozygous dominant and recessive), all phenotypes will appear, but the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the question states that the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), meaning all F1 will have CcBb, and F2 will be the F1 selfed. So, applying the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- Phenotype 1: All C and B dominant \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 1 part\n\nBut wait, this assumes that both genes are fully dominant, which they are in this case. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 Phenotype 1, 3 Phenotype 2, 3 Phenotype 3, 1 Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option G is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option J, which lists Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled A to J, with each option listing different ratios. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option J, which corresponds to this ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 100%\nWait, that seems incorrect because it implies all birds have both traits, which isn't realistic. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will exhibit those traits. So for pigment color: if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color: if B is present, brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are based on the combinations of these two traits. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible combination of the two traits, calculate the probability.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\n3.

Plain and checkered (c and B recessive):\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because it implies that all birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to all being red-brown and/or plain-checkered. But in reality, some birds could be plain-red, plain-checkered, red-checkered, or checkered-checkered. But according to the given dominance hierarchy, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it expresses both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 100% (all birds)\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 0%\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 0%\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nThat seems odd. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait doesn't mean the entire trait appears. Wait, no\u2014the standard dominance applies where a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it exhibits the corresponding trait. Therefore, the phenotype would be determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not (recessive).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (pigment red and brown) \u2192 100%\n2. Only pigment red (no B) \u2192 0%\n3. Only checkered (no C) \u2192 0%\n4. Only brown (no B) \u2192 0%\n\nThis can't be right because it would imply all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait despite having the other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 represented by any bird with at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 any bird with C but without B.\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 any bird without C but with B.\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 any bird without C and without B.\n\nNow, considering the parents are homozygous for both genes, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since Parent 1 is homozygous, it'll always contribute CC and BB. Parent 2 is homozygous recessive, contributing cc and bb. So the F1 will be CcBb. Wait, but in the question, the F2 comes from F1 selfing, so each F1 bird (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the parents are CcBb, so the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C locus: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (present) and B (present) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%?\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each gene's expression is independent, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 (1) * (1) = 100%? No, because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me consider all possible combinations:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n   - Present (Red): 100% (since any C gives red)\n- For body color (B):\n   - Present (Brown): 100% (any B gives brown)\nTherefore, the only phenotype that exists is Pigment red and Brown, because both traits are expressed. All other phenotypes (Red and Checkered, Plain and Brown, Plain and Checkered) would require either not expressing pigment red or body brown. But since each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, all phenotypes except Pigment red and Brown exist only if both traits are expressed. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it shows both traits. So the only phenotype possible is Pigment red and Brown, because any bird that has at least one C and at least one B will have both traits. Conversely, any bird missing at least one dominant allele for a trait will not have that trait expressed. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nEach of these would occur based on the combinations of the parents' gametes. Since the F1 is CcBb, and it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (but since C is dominant, this would be Pigment red)\n- 25% Cc (Pigment red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n- 25% BB (Body brown)\n- 25% Bb (Body brown)\n- 25% bb (Plain and Body checkered)\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate because each gene's effect is considered separately. The actual phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of both traits. So, for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1 (dominant:recessive). Since the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So for each trait, it's 2:1, but since both traits are expressed together, the overall ratio is different.\n\nLet me try to compute the phenotypic ratios step by step. \n\nFirst, determine the probability of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown:\n   - This occurs when both genes are dominant (C and B present).\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is impossible because it implies 100% of the population, which isn't the case here. Wait, this indicates a misunderstanding. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or not, regardless of dominance. So the probability of Pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the probability of Brown is 1 (any B gives brown). Therefore, the probability of both traits appearing is 1 * 1 = 100%, meaning all birds have both traits. This seems incorrect because it would suggest all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some might have only one. So perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for a trait does not guarantee the trait's expression. Wait, no\u2014the standard understanding is that a dominant allele makes the trait expressed. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays the trait. Therefore, in this scenario, all birds would display both traits because they have both dominant alleles for both genes. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% Pigment red and Brown, and 0% for the others. But that can't be right because it would mean all birds have both traits, which isn't what the question is asking. Perhaps the question assumes that each trait is expressed independently, but in reality, they're linked through the same genes. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me look at the options provided to see which one fits best.\n\nThe options are A to J, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but how did they get that?\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for F2. Let's construct it properly. Each F1 bird is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- For C locus: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThe Punnett square will combine these:\n\n```\n          | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        -----------------\n          |       |       |       |\n          Cc | CC BB | CC Bb | CC bb |\n          Bb | CB BB | CB Bb | CB bb |\n          bb | cc BB | cc Bb | cc bb |\n```\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the Punnett square for the F2 would have:\n\n```\n           |    CC    |    Cc    |    cc     |\n           -----------------------------\n         |       |        |          |\n         |      |        |          |\n         |       |        |          |\n         | CC | 1/4 BB | 1/4 Bb | 1/4 bb |\n         -----------------------------\n         | Cc | 1/4 CB | 1/4 BB | 1/4 Bb | 1/4 bb |\n         -----------------------------\n         | cc | 1/4 ccBb | 1/4 cc Bb | 1/4 cc bb |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the construction. Each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant), the phenotypic ratios are calculated by considering each combination:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C present, B present) \u2192 all these birds will have both traits. Since each bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they all express both traits. So the phenotype is Pigment red and Brown, and the frequency is 25%.\n\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 These birds have C present but not B, so they will have Pigment red and plain body. Frequency is 25%.\n\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Have C absent but B present, so plain body and Brown. Frequency is 25%.\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent) \u2192 Have neither trait expressed. Frequency is 25%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because it would imply all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to full expression, while the absence leads to no expression. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25% (all birds)\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25% (only C present, no B)\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25% (only B present, no C)\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25% (no C or B)\n\nBut that still leaves all four phenotypes, each occurring at 25%. However, looking back at the options, none seem to match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that doesn't align with my calculation. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that also doesn't fit. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the question. The checkered pigmentation is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain by B. So, the presence of a dominant allele for each trait results in the phenotype. So, a bird with at least one C (C is dominant) will have Pigment red, and at least one B will have Brown body. So the only phenotype without both traits is when neither C nor B is present, i.e., when c and b are both present, resulting in plain body and plain pigment. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to express it, but the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the trait is fully expressed. Wait, no\u2014the standard assumption is that a dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to the trait being displayed. Therefore, all four phenotypes would be present, each at 25%. But that's not reflected in any of the options. \n\nLooking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is more than 16 birds (assuming the original sample size). Option D: 1,3,9,3 adds up to 16 as well. Option G: 12+2+2+0=16, which is also correct. Option H: 5+3+2+6=16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option B: 8+4+0+4=16. Option C: 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nNone of these options represent a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, option E sums to 16: 3 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 16. Option G: 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16. Option H: 5 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait doesn't mean the trait is expressed. No, that's not correct under standard genetics principles. The presence of a dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. Therefore, all four phenotypes would occur, each at 25%, totaling 100%. None of the options reflect this exact distribution. However, perhaps the options are based on a different model where the presence of a dominant allele doesn't lead to expression unless the other gene is also present. But that would complicate things further. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the phenotype being displayed, but the other trait doesn't matter. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nWhich again doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that a bird without both dominant alleles for a trait doesn't express it, which would reduce the number of phenotypes. For example, a bird with C but no B wouldn't express the Brown body trait. Similarly, a bird with b but no C wouldn't express the Pigment red trait. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nSame issue. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that only one trait can be expressed, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that each gene's effect is independent, and the phenotypic ratio is calculated as the product of the individual ratios. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (assuming two alleles), but since we have two genes, the overall ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the sum of the products of the individual ratios. \n\nIn this case, each gene's contribution would lead to:\n\n- 25% for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles, leading to a total of 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, with the phenotypic ratio being 9:3:3:1. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't appear. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 100%\nWait, that seems incorrect because it implies all birds have both traits, which isn't realistic. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will exhibit those traits. So for pigment color: if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color: if B is present, brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are based on the combinations of these two traits. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible combination of the two traits, calculate the probability.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant):\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive):\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because it implies that all birds have at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to all being red-brown and/or plain-checkered. But in reality, some birds could be plain-red, plain-checkered, red-checkered, or checkered-checkered. But according to the given dominance hierarchy, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it expresses both traits. Otherwise, it doesn't. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 100% (all birds)\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 0%\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 0%\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nThat seems odd. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait doesn't mean the entire trait appears. Wait, no\u2014the standard dominance applies where a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it exhibits the corresponding trait. Therefore, the phenotype would be determined by whether each gene is present (dominant) or not (recessive).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (pigment red and brown) \u2192 100%\n2. Only pigment red (no B) \u2192 0%\n3. Only checkered (no C) \u2192 0%\n4. Only brown (no B) \u2192 0%\n\nThis can't be right because it would imply all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some birds might lack one trait despite having the other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 represented by any bird with at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 any bird with C but without B.\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 any bird without C but with B.\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 any bird without C and without B.\n\nNow, considering the parents are homozygous for both genes, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since Parent 1 is homozygous, it'll always contribute CC and BB. Parent 2 is homozygous recessive, contributing cc and bb. So the F1 will be CcBb. Wait, but in the question, the F2 comes from F1 selfing, so each F1 bird (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the parents are CcBb, so the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C locus: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the F2 phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (present) and B (present) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%?\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each gene's expression is independent, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 (1) * (1) = 100%? No, because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me consider all possible combinations:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n   - Present (Red): 100% (since any C gives red)\n- For body color (B):\n   - Present (Brown): 100% (any B gives brown)\nTherefore, the only phenotype that exists is Pigment red and Brown, because both traits are expressed. All other phenotypes (Red and Checkered, Plain and Brown, Plain and Checkered) would require either not expressing pigment red or body brown. But since each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, all phenotypes except Pigment red and Brown exist only if both traits are expressed. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it shows both traits. So the only phenotype possible is Pigment red and Brown, because any bird that has at least one C and at least one B will have both traits. Conversely, any bird missing at least one dominant allele for a trait will not have that trait expressed. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nEach of these would occur based on the combinations of the parents' gametes. Since the F1 is CcBb, and it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (but since C is dominant, this would be Pigment red)\n- 25% Cc (Pigment red)\n- 25% cc (Plain)\n- 25% BB (Body brown)\n- 25% Bb (Body brown)\n- 25% bb (Plain and Body checkered)\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate because each gene's effect is considered separately. The actual phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of both traits. So, for each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1 (dominant:recessive). Since the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So for each trait, it's 2:1, but since both traits are expressed together, the overall ratio is different.\n\nLet me try to compute the phenotypic ratios step by step. \n\nFirst, determine the probability of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown:\n   - This occurs when both genes are dominant (C and B present).\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is impossible because it implies 100% of the population, which isn't the case here. Wait, this indicates a misunderstanding. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or not, regardless of dominance. So the probability of Pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the probability of Brown is 1 (any B gives brown). Therefore, the probability of both traits appearing is 1 * 1 = 100%, meaning all birds have both traits. This seems incorrect because it would suggest all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that some might have only one. So perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for a trait does not guarantee the trait's expression. Wait, no\u2014the standard understanding is that a dominant allele makes the trait expressed. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays the trait. Therefore, in this scenario, all birds would display both traits because they have both dominant alleles for both genes. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% Pigment red and Brown, and 0% for the others. But that can't be right because it would mean all birds have both traits, which isn't what the question is asking. Perhaps the question assumes that each trait is expressed independently, but in reality, they're linked through the same genes. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me look at the options provided to see which one fits best.\n\nThe options are A to J, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but how did they get that?\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for F2. Let's construct it properly. Each F1 bird is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- For C locus: CC, Cc, cc\n- For B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThe Punnett square will combine these:\n\n```\n          | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        -----------------\n          |       |       |       |\n          Cc | CC BB | CC Bb | CC bb |\n          Bb | CB BB | CB Bb | CB bb |\n          bb | cc BB | cc Bb | cc bb |\n```\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the Punnett square for the F2 would have:\n\n```\n           |    CC    |    Cc    |    cc     |\n           -----------------------------\n         |       |        |          |\n         |      |        |          |\n         |       |        |          |\n         | CC | 1/4 BB | 1/4 Bb | 1/4 bb |\n         -----------------------------\n         | Cc | 1/4 CB | 1/4 BB | 1/4 Bb | 1/4 bb |\n         -----------------------------\n         | cc | 1/4 ccBb | 1/4 cc Bb | 1/4 cc bb |\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the construction. Each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present (dominant), the phenotypic ratios are calculated by considering each combination:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C present, B present) \u2192 all these birds will have both traits. Since each bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they all express both traits. So the phenotype is Pigment red and Brown, and the frequency is 25%.\n\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 These birds have C present but not B, so they will have Pigment red and plain body. Frequency is 25%.\n\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Have C absent but B present, so plain body and Brown. Frequency is 25%.\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent) \u2192 Have neither trait expressed. Frequency is 25%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because it would imply all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to full expression, while the absence leads to no expression. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25% (all birds)\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25% (only C present, no B)\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25% (only B present, no C)\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25% (no C or B)\n\nBut that still leaves all four phenotypes, each occurring at 25%. However, looking back at the options, none seem to match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that doesn't align with my calculation. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that also doesn't fit. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the question. The checkered pigmentation is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain by B. So, the presence of a dominant allele for each trait results in the phenotype. So, a bird with at least one C (C is dominant) will have Pigment red, and at least one B will have Brown body. So the only phenotype without both traits is when neither C nor B is present, i.e., when c and b are both present, resulting in plain body and plain pigment. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to express it, but the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean the trait is fully expressed. Wait, no\u2014the standard assumption is that a dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to the trait being displayed. Therefore, all four phenotypes would be present, each at 25%. But that's not reflected in any of the options. \n\nLooking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is more than 16 birds (assuming the original sample size). Option D: 1,3,9,3 adds up to 16 as well. Option G: 12+2+2+0=16, which is also correct. Option H: 5+3+2+6=16. Option A: 6+2+6+2=16. Option B: 8+4+0+4=16. Option C: 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nNone of these options represent a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, option E sums to 16: 3 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 16. Option G: 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16. Option H: 5 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait doesn't mean the trait is expressed. No, that's not correct under standard genetics principles. The presence of a dominant allele leads to the trait being expressed. Therefore, all four phenotypes would occur, each at 25%, totaling 100%. None of the options reflect this exact distribution. However, perhaps the options are based on a different model where the presence of a dominant allele doesn't lead to expression unless the other gene is also present. But that would complicate things further. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that only the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the phenotype being displayed, but the other trait doesn't matter. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nWhich again doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that a bird without both dominant alleles for a trait doesn't express it, which would reduce the number of phenotypes. For example, a bird with C but no B wouldn't express the Brown body trait. Similarly, a bird with b but no C wouldn't express the Pigment red trait. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and plain \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n4. Plain and plain \u2192 25%\n\nSame issue. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that only one trait can be expressed, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that each gene's effect is independent, and the phenotypic ratio is calculated as the product of the individual ratios. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (assuming two alleles), but since we have two genes, the overall ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the sum of the products of the individual ratios. \n\nIn this case, each gene's contribution would lead to:\n\n- 25% for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles, leading to a total of 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, with the phenotypic ratio being 9:3:3:1. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2,",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, the bird may have one trait depending on the dominance.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, the bird may have one trait depending on the dominance. Let me clarify:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C: red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotype can be categorized as follows:\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nEach bird's genotype will determine their phenotype. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, all F2 individuals will inherit one allele from each parent. Let's see the possible combinations:\n\nParent 1 (for pigment): CC \u2192 can only pass C.\nParent 2 (for pigment): cc \u2192 can only pass c.\nThus, for pigment (C), the F1 will always be Cc, and the F2 will have a 50% chance of being CC or cc.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Wait, the F1 comes from crossing CC (parent 1) and cc (parent 2), so F1 is Cc. Then, F1 selfs (mating with itself) results in F2 where each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C):\n- C from F1 + C \u2192 CC (red)\n- C from F1 + c \u2192 Cc (red)\n- c from F1 + C \u2192 Cc (red)\n- c from F1 + c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nSo for pigment, the probabilities are:\n- 2/3 chance of C (red)\n- 1/3 chance of c (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Parent 1 (bb) can only pass b.\n- Parent 2 (CC) can only pass C.\nThus, F1 is Cb, and F2 will have:\n- 50% CB (B dominant, brown)\n- 50% cb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 (cc) can only contribute c, and Parent 2 (CC) can only contribute C. Thus, F1 (Cc) and F2 (Cc \u00d7 Cc):\n\nFor B:\n- Parent 1: c\n- Parent 2: C\nSo F2 will receive either C from Parent 2 and c from Parent 1. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is cc (only c) and Parent 2 is CC (only C), then F1 (Cc) and F2 (Cc \u00d7 Cc) will have the following:\n\nFor B:\n- Each gamete from Parent 1 (cc) is c.\n- Each gamete from Parent 2 (CC) is C.\nSo F2 will receive either C or c from Parent 2, and c from Parent 1. Wait, no\u2014this isn't correct. Let me re-examine. The F1 is Cc, which is C from Parent 2 and c from Parent 1. When F1 selfs, each gamete from F1 can be C or c, but since F1 is Cc, the gametes would be C and c in equal proportions. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so gametes would be 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, Parent 1 is cc, so gametes are all c. Therefore, the F2 will receive either C or c from Parent 2, and c from Parent 1. So the possible gametes for F2 are Cc (from Parent 2's C and Parent 1's c) and cc (from Parent 2's c and Parent 1's c). So the F2 genotype will be Cc (from C and c) and cc (from c and c).\n\nTherefore, for pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (red) is 2/3 (from Cc)\n- Probability of c (plain) is 1/3 (from cc)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- From Parent 1 (cc) contributing c and Parent 2 (CC) contributing C, so F2 will get either C or c.\n- Since Parent 1 can only contribute c, and Parent 2 can only contribute C, the F2 genotype will be Cc (from C and c) and cc (from c and c).\n- So for B:\n  - 50% chance of receiving C (brown)\n  - 50% chance of receiving c (checkered)\n\nNow, to find the overall phenotype probabilities, we consider the combinations of pigment and body colors.\n\nThere are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C and B dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c and B dominant\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown)\n- P(C) = 2/3\n- P(B) = 50% (or 1/2)\n- Assuming independence, P(phenotype 1) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n\nPhenotype 2: C (red) and b (checkered)\n- P(C) = 2/3\n- P(b) = 50%\n- P(phenotype 2) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n\nPhenotype 3: c (plain) and B (brown)\n- P(c) = 1/3\n- P(B) = 1/2\n- P(phenotype 3) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nPhenotype 4: c (plain) and b (checkered)\n- P(c) = 1/3\n- P(b) = 1/2\n- P(phenotype 4) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nAdding up the probabilities:\n1/3 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n- Checkered red (Phenotype 2): 1/3\n- Plain red (Phenotype 3): 1/6\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype 1): 1/3\n- Plain brown (Phenotype 4): 1/6\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:2:1 when expressed as ratios.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Ratios 6:6:2:2 \u2192 Simplifies to 3:3:1:1, which doesn't match our calculation.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Ratios 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't what we have.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nNone of the options seem to directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. For phenotype 1 (C and B), P = 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. For phenotype 2 (C and b), also 1/3. Phenotype 3 (c and B): 1/6, same as phenotype 4. So the ratios are indeed 1/3 : 1/3 : 1/6 : 1/6 \u2192 Multiply by 6 to eliminate denominators: 2:2:1:1. So the phenotypic ratio should be 2:2:1:1, which is equivalent to 6:6:2:2 when scaled up by a factor of 3. Looking at option A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Yes! Option A matches exactly the ratios I derived after scaling up by 3.\n\nWait, but looking back, the F2 generation would produce 9 birds, right? Because each F1 (which is CcBb) selfs into 9 possible gametes, leading to 9 F2 birds. The phenotypic ratios would then be 6:6:2:2, but that sums to 16, which is impossible. Wait, that indicates a miscalculation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each gene is segregating independently, so for each bird, the number of phenotypes is 2^2=4, but the actual count depends on the number of possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use a Punnett square. Let me try constructing it properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 will be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes).\n\nThen, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 will include all combinations of the F1's alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment color):\n- Possible gametes from F1: CB and cb (but wait, since F1 is Cc, the gametes would be C and c in equal parts. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (Cc) will produce gametes C and c equally. So for C locus, F1 produces C (25%) and c (75%), no\u2014wait, no. F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). Similarly, for B locus (body color), F1 is Bb (since F1 is CcBb, but when considering only B, it's Bb from each parent?), wait no\u2014let's correct this.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to separate the genes. The F1 (CcBb) is heterozygous for both genes. So for the C locus, the gametes will be C (50%) and c (50%). For the B locus, the gametes will be B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have all combinations of these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect. Because each gene segregates independently, the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- For C: 50% C and 50% c\n- For B: 50% B and 50% b\n\nSo the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% probability. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC (C) \u2192 red pigment\n- cc (c) \u2192 plain\n- BB (B) \u2192 brown\n- cb (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, for each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n5. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as above\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because each bird is determined by both genes. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n5. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 5\n7. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype 1 and 2 \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype 5 and 6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red: Phenotype 3 and 4 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain brown: Phenotype 7 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, but that adds up to 8 birds, but F2 should have 9 birds. Where am I missing one? Oh, because F2 includes both parents producing gametes, so perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes half the F2 population, so F2 has 9 birds. But according to the counts, only 8 are accounted for. Let me list them again:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered red (2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (3)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain red (4)\n5. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown (5)\n6. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown (6)\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (7)\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (8)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (9)\n\nAh, I missed bird 9. Bird 9 must be cc bb, which is plain brown. So now, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nWait, that totals to 9. Okay, now the phenotypic ratios are 2:2:2:3. But none of the options reflect that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions don\u2019t have 2:2:2:3. They have various numbers like 6,6,2,2 for option A, which would mean 6 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. That doesn't align with our current understanding. So perhaps I've made a mistake in determining the F2 genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the segregation. Let me try again, considering that each F1 (CcBb) selfs, leading to 9 F2 birds. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene, so F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes C, c for C; B, b for B.\n\nSo, for C locus: 50% C, 50% c\nFor B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes. How come we're getting nine birds? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how to interpret the phenotypes. Perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive, regardless of the other. So for example, CC (red) and B (brown) would combine to make \"red brown,\" while c (plain) and b (checkered) would make \"plain checkered.\"\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red brown\n- Only C dominant (C and b) \u2192 red checkered\n- Only B dominant (c and B) \u2192 plain brown\n- Neither dominant (c and b) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, but that's different from what I thought before. So let me redefine the phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for each gene \u2192 red brown\n2. Only dominant for C and recessive for B \u2192 red checkered\n3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, the bird may have one trait depending on the dominance. Let me clarify:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C: red (dominant)\n- c: plain (recessive)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B: brown (dominant)\n- b: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotype can be categorized as follows:\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nEach bird's genotype will determine their phenotype. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective genes, all F2 individuals will inherit one allele from each parent. Let's see the possible combinations:\n\nParent 1 (for pigment): CC \u2192 can only pass C.\nParent 2 (for pigment): cc \u2192 can only pass c.\nThus, for pigment (C), the F1 will always be Cc, and the F2 will have a 50% chance of being CC or cc.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Wait, the F1 comes from crossing CC (parent 1) and cc (parent 2), so F1 is Cc. Then, F1 selfs (mating with itself) results in F2 where each gene segregates independently. So for pigment (C):\n- C from F1 + C \u2192 CC (red)\n- C from F1 + c \u2192 Cc (red)\n- c from F1 + C \u2192 Cc (red)\n- c from F1 + c \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nSo for pigment, the probabilities are:\n- 2/3 chance of C (red)\n- 1/3 chance of c (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Parent 1 (bb) can only pass b.\n- Parent 2 (CC) can only pass C.\nThus, F1 is Cb, and F2 will have:\n- 50% CB (B dominant, brown)\n- 50% cb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 (cc) can only contribute c, and Parent 2 (CC) can only contribute C. Thus, F1 (Cc) and F2 (Cc \u00d7 Cc):\n\nFor B:\n- Parent 1: c\n- Parent 2: C\nSo F2 will receive either C from Parent 2 and c from Parent 1. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is cc (only c) and Parent 2 is CC (only C), then F1 (Cc) and F2 (Cc \u00d7 Cc) will have the following:\n\nFor B:\n- Each gamete from Parent 1 (cc) is c.\n- Each gamete from Parent 2 (CC) is C.\nSo F2 will receive either C or c from Parent 2, and c from Parent 1. Wait, no\u2014this isn't correct. Let me re-examine. The F1 is Cc, which is C from Parent 2 and c from Parent 1. When F1 selfs, each gamete from F1 can be C or c, but since F1 is Cc, the gametes would be C and c in equal proportions. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so gametes would be 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, Parent 1 is cc, so gametes are all c. Therefore, the F2 will receive either C or c from Parent 2, and c from Parent 1. So the possible gametes for F2 are Cc (from Parent 2's C and Parent 1's c) and cc (from Parent 2's c and Parent 1's c). So the F2 genotype will be Cc (from C and c) and cc (from c and c).\n\nTherefore, for pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (red) is 2/3 (from Cc)\n- Probability of c (plain) is 1/3 (from cc)\n\nFor body color (B):\n- From Parent 1 (cc) contributing c and Parent 2 (CC) contributing C, so F2 will get either C or c.\n- Since Parent 1 can only contribute c, and Parent 2 can only contribute C, the F2 genotype will be Cc (from C and c) and cc (from c and c).\n- So for B:\n  - 50% chance of receiving C (brown)\n  - 50% chance of receiving c (checkered)\n\nNow, to find the overall phenotype probabilities, we consider the combinations of pigment and body colors.\n\nThere are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C and B dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c and B dominant\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown)\n- P(C) = 2/3\n- P(B) = 50% (or 1/2)\n- Assuming independence, P(phenotype 1) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n\nPhenotype 2: C (red) and b (checkered)\n- P(C) = 2/3\n- P(b) = 50%\n- P(phenotype 2) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n\nPhenotype 3: c (plain) and B (brown)\n- P(c) = 1/3\n- P(B) = 1/2\n- P(phenotype 3) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nPhenotype 4: c (plain) and b (checkered)\n- P(c) = 1/3\n- P(b) = 1/2\n- P(phenotype 4) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nAdding up the probabilities:\n1/3 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n- Checkered red (Phenotype 2): 1/3\n- Plain red (Phenotype 3): 1/6\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype 1): 1/3\n- Plain brown (Phenotype 4): 1/6\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:2:1 when expressed as ratios.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Ratios 6:6:2:2 \u2192 Simplifies to 3:3:1:1, which doesn't match our calculation.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Ratios 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, which isn't what we have.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nNone of the options seem to directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. For phenotype 1 (C and B), P = 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. For phenotype 2 (C and b), also 1/3. Phenotype 3 (c and B): 1/6, same as phenotype 4. So the ratios are indeed 1/3 : 1/3 : 1/6 : 1/6 \u2192 Multiply by 6 to eliminate denominators: 2:2:1:1. So the phenotypic ratio should be 2:2:1:1, which is equivalent to 6:6:2:2 when scaled up by a factor of 3. Looking at option A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Yes! Option A matches exactly the ratios I derived after scaling up by 3.\n\nWait, but looking back, the F2 generation would produce 9 birds, right? Because each F1 (which is CcBb) selfs into 9 possible gametes, leading to 9 F2 birds. The phenotypic ratios would then be 6:6:2:2, but that sums to 16, which is impossible. Wait, that indicates a miscalculation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each gene is segregating independently, so for each bird, the number of phenotypes is 2^2=4, but the actual count depends on the number of possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use a Punnett square. Let me try constructing it properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 will be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes).\n\nThen, the F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 will include all combinations of the F1's alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment color):\n- Possible gametes from F1: CB and cb (but wait, since F1 is Cc, the gametes would be C and c in equal parts. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (Cc) will produce gametes C and c equally. So for C locus, F1 produces C (25%) and c (75%), no\u2014wait, no. F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). Similarly, for B locus (body color), F1 is Bb (since F1 is CcBb, but when considering only B, it's Bb from each parent?), wait no\u2014let's correct this.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to separate the genes. The F1 (CcBb) is heterozygous for both genes. So for the C locus, the gametes will be C (50%) and c (50%). For the B locus, the gametes will be B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have all combinations of these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect. Because each gene segregates independently, the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- For C: 50% C and 50% c\n- For B: 50% B and 50% b\n\nSo the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% probability. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC (C) \u2192 red pigment\n- cc (c) \u2192 plain\n- BB (B) \u2192 brown\n- cb (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, for each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n5. CC bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as above\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because each bird is determined by both genes. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n5. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 checkered brown\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 5\n7. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype 1 and 2 \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype 5 and 6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red: Phenotype 3 and 4 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain brown: Phenotype 7 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, but that adds up to 8 birds, but F2 should have 9 birds. Where am I missing one? Oh, because F2 includes both parents producing gametes, so perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes half the F2 population, so F2 has 9 birds. But according to the counts, only 8 are accounted for. Let me list them again:\n\nFrom F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered red (2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (3)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain red (4)\n5. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown (5)\n6. CC bb \u2192 checkered brown (6)\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (7)\n8. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (8)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (9)\n\nAh, I missed bird 9. Bird 9 must be cc bb, which is plain brown. So now, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nWait, that totals to 9. Okay, now the phenotypic ratios are 2:2:2:3. But none of the options reflect that. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions don\u2019t have 2:2:2:3. They have various numbers like 6,6,2,2 for option A, which would mean 6 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. That doesn't align with our current understanding. So perhaps I've made a mistake in determining the F2 genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the segregation. Let me try again, considering that each F1 (CcBb) selfs, leading to 9 F2 birds. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene, so F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes C, c for C; B, b for B.\n\nSo, for C locus: 50% C, 50% c\nFor B locus: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown \u2192 checkered red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes. How come we're getting nine birds? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how to interpret the phenotypes. Perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive, regardless of the other. So for example, CC (red) and B (brown) would combine to make \"red brown,\" while c (plain) and b (checkered) would make \"plain checkered.\"\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red brown\n- Only C dominant (C and b) \u2192 red checkered\n- Only B dominant (c and B) \u2192 plain brown\n- Neither dominant (c and b) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, but that's different from what I thought before. So let me redefine the phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele for each gene \u2192 red brown\n2. Only dominant for C and recessive for B \u2192 red checkered\n3. Dominant for B and recessive for C \u2192 plain brown\n4. Neither dominant \u2192 plain checkered\n\nGiven that, let's recalculate the F2 phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (1 bird)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red checkered (1 bird)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (1 bird)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain checkered (1 bird)\n5. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (1 bird)\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 5\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered (1 bird)\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as 7\n\nWait, that still only accounts for 8 birds, with one bird missing. I must be making a mistake here. Let me list all nine:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red checkered (2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (3)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 plain checkered (4)\n5. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (5)\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 5\n7. cc bb \u2192 plain checkered (6)\n8. cc bb \u2192 same as 6\n9. cc bb \u2192 same as 6\n\nThat sums to 9 birds, with:\n\n- Checkered red: 0\n- Checkered brown: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nThis doesn't align with any of the options either. I must be doing something wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of focusing on F2, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation, not F2. But the question says \"F2 generation.\" Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect.\n\nWait, the question states that the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't. So the phenotypes are:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant) \u2192 Probability: 1 (since both genes are always dominant)\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each gene is independent, but the presence of each allele affects the trait. So, regardless of what the other allele is, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So, in reality, every bird will have both traits unless... Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll display both traits. So actually, the phenotype is determined solely by the alleles present, and all birds will display both traits because both parents' alleles are dominant for both genes.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options given don't include a ratio where all phenotypes are present equally. Let me re-express the problem. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each dominant allele, and the phenotypic ratio refers to how often each combination occurs among the F2 generation. Let me approach this differently. The key is to determine the phenotypic ratios by considering the possible combinations of alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nEach gene is controlled by a separate pair of loci, so the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the corresponding trait. However, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. So, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each combination can be calculated by determining the probabilities of each allele being inherited. Since each parent contributes one allele from each gene, the inheritance is independent for each gene. \n\nLet me consider each gene separately first. For gene C:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes C.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes c.\nSo, for gene C, the probability of passing C is 100%, and the probability of passing c is 100%.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes B.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes b.\nSo, for gene B, the probability of passing B is 100%, and the probability of passing b is 100%.\n\nTherefore, each bird in the F2 generation must carry both alleles needed to express both traits. So, every bird will display both red pigment and brown body color because both parents contribute C and B respectively. Therefore, all four phenotypes would occur equally. But looking back at the answer choices, none of them show all four phenotypes with equal counts. Instead, the options vary in how the phenotypes are grouped.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all birds will display both traits. Let me double-check. For each gene, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. Since each parent contributes only one allele for each gene, the possible alleles passed are fixed. For example, for gene C, Parent 1 passes C, Parent 2 passes c. So each bird will inherit C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in Cc. Similarly, for gene B, Parent 1 passes B, Parent 2 passes b, so each bird will inherit B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in Bb. Combining these, each bird's genotype is CcBb. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment color (C): C is dominant, so all birds will have red pigment. For body color (B): B is dominant, so all birds will have brown body color. Therefore, all F2 birds will display both traits: red pigment and brown body color. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for each phenotype, but this isn't reflected in the answer choices. This suggests that my understanding might be incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the phenotypic expression based on the presence of at least one dominant allele, but I thought that was already covered. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the possible genotypes and then the phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation's possible genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc BB (c dominant, B dominant)\n- cc Bb (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSince all birds in this generation will have both traits expressed due to dominant alleles, all four phenotypes would occur. However, the answer choices do not reflect this. Let me look at the answer options again:\n\nOptions G to J are various ratios, such as 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option D mentions checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Option A is 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios within each trait category rather than across both traits. That is, perhaps it's counting how many birds have red pigment vs. plain, and brown vs. checkered, without considering the interaction between the two traits. But the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the question again: \"phenotypic ratio\" likely refers to the overall distribution across all phenotypes. Alternatively, it could mean the distribution within each trait category. Let me try both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Overall phenotypic ratio (considering both traits together).\nAs established earlier, all four phenotypes would occur equally, but this isn't represented in the answer choices. Approach 2: Phenotypic ratio within each trait category (e.g., how many have red pigment vs. plain, ignoring color).\n\nIf that's the case, let's see:\n\n- Red pigment (C) over plain (c): All birds have red pigment (since C is dominant), except those who are cc (but in our case, all are Cc or cc). Wait, no\u2014all birds have C from Parent 1, so all have pigment red. Therefore, all would have red pigment, making the ratio 100% red over plain.\n\nSimilarly, for brown (B) over checkered (b):\n\n- Brown (B) over checkered (b): All birds have B from Parent 1, so all have brown body color. Therefore, all would have brown, making the ratio 100% brown over checkered.\n\nHowever, neither of these matches the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of each phenotype type, treating each trait separately. Let's count the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2: checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain brown\n\nAssuming equal numbers of each genotype, each phenotype would have the same frequency. But again, the answer choices suggest different distributions. Looking at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total 16 birds. So, in this case, 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Let's verify:\n\nTotal birds in F2 would be 4x4=16, assuming a 1:1:1:1 ratio. If all four phenotypes are equally likely, each would have 4 birds. But option G says checkered red 12, which is higher than 4. That suggests that the calculation may involve some other factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misinterpreted. Let me reconsider the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation. It might be referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to others. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype type, grouping them by their dominant traits.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the question is asking about the ratio of checkered versus plain for each color. For pigment:\n\n- Checkered (c) over plain (C): How many have checkered compared to plain?\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Checkered (b) over brown (B): How many have checkered compared to brown?\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the number of checkered vs. plain for pigment, and similarly for color.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered (c) would come from cc (which includes bb and cb). From the F2 genotype list, the cc individuals are: 25% (cc BB), 25% (cc Bb), 25% (cc cb), and 25% (cc bb)\u2014no, wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nWait, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\nAnd also, any other possible genotypes? No, because F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused F1 and F2. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\nF1: CcBb (heterozygous)\nF2: CcBb x CcBb\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc: leading to CC, Cc, cc\n- Bb x Bb: leading to BB, Bb, bb\nSince these are independent, the combined F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of CC/BB, Cc/Bb, cc/bb. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nThese are the four phenotypes. Assuming a 1:1:1:1 distribution, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let's look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Total 16. So, 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nHmm, the sum of all phenotypes in each option equals 16. Let's calculate for option G:\n\nCheckered red (12) + checkered brown (2) + plain red (2) + plain brown (2) = 18. That's too high because there are only 16 birds in total. Therefore, option G is invalid.\n\nOption E: 3+9+1+3=16. That adds up correctly. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nBut why would checkered brown be more than checkered red? Let's recalculate:\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the checkered phenotypes are derived from the cc and bb genotypes. The cc and bb can produce checkered (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc Bb) and plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc Bb). Wait, no\u2014the correct way is:\n\n- The checkered phenotype comes from having at least one recessive allele for each gene. So, for each gene, if the individual is cc or cc, they are checkered. For each gene, if they have B or b, they are brown.\n\nThus, the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive (cc) plus when one gene is recessive and the other is dominant. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is that a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for pigment color, a bird is red if they have at least one C allele. Similarly, for body color, a bird is brown if they have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype occurs when:\n\n- Either cc (regardless of B) or cc (regardless of B), but wait, no. Actually, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one recessive allele for both genes. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The checkered phenotype occurs when the bird is not displaying either trait fully. So, for pigment, it's checkered when they have at least one c allele, and for body, checkered when they have at least one b allele. Therefore, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one c and at least one b allele. But that's impossible because an individual can't have both c and b alleles simultaneously. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, that's incorrect. The checkered phenotype occurs when the bird is not expressing either trait fully. So, for pigment color, it's checkered when they have at least one c allele, and for body color, it's checkered when they have at least one b allele. Therefore, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one c and at least one b allele. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate because an individual can't have both c and b alleles at the same time. So, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they are cc (for pigment) and bb (for body), i.e., they have both recessive alleles for both genes. In all other cases, they have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, the only way to be checkered is to have cc and bb, which is 1/16 of the population. Any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will have both traits expressed, hence appearing as red and brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Only 1 bird out of 16 will be checkered (cc and bb), so checkered phenotype: 1 bird.\n- The remaining 15 birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus appearing as red and brown.\n\nNow, within these 15, how are they distributed between checkered and plain? Well, the checkered phenotype (plain) is only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). So, that's 1 bird. The rest (15 birds) will have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so their phenotypes are red and brown.\n\nWithin these 15, how many have red and how many have brown? Let's see:\n\nEach bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, the number of red (pigment) and brown (body) alleles will depend on the specific genotypes.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 all red and brown \u2192 phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nAdditionally, there are other possible genotypes if F1 produces different gametes. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F1 x F1 would produce F2 as follows:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the C locus (pigment), F1 is Cc, so gametes are C and c. For the B locus (color), F1 is Bb, so gametes are B and b. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 leading to:\n\n  - CC (C from Cc and C from Bb)\n  - Cc (C from Cc and b from Bb)\n  - cC (c from Cc and C from Bb)\n  - cc (c from Cc and c from Bb)\n\nWait, but since Cc x Bb leads to:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 phenotype 2\n- CC bb \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain)\n- Cc BB \u2192 phenotype 4\n- Cc Bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- Cc bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- cc BB \u2192 phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- cc bb \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: checkered red (only CC BB and CC Bb and",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't. So the phenotypes are:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant) \u2192 Probability: 1 (since both genes are always dominant)\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each gene is independent, but the presence of each allele affects the trait. So, regardless of what the other allele is, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. So, in reality, every bird will have both traits unless... Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll display both traits. So actually, the phenotype is determined solely by the alleles present, and all birds will display both traits because both parents' alleles are dominant for both genes.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options given don't include a ratio where all phenotypes are present equally. Let me re-express the problem. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of each dominant allele, and the phenotypic ratio refers to how often each combination occurs among the F2 generation. Let me approach this differently. The key is to determine the phenotypic ratios by considering the possible combinations of alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nEach gene is controlled by a separate pair of loci, so the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the corresponding trait. However, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. So, the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each combination can be calculated by determining the probabilities of each allele being inherited. Since each parent contributes one allele from each gene, the inheritance is independent for each gene. \n\nLet me consider each gene separately first. For gene C:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes C.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes c.\nSo, for gene C, the probability of passing C is 100%, and the probability of passing c is 100%.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) contributes B.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) contributes b.\nSo, for gene B, the probability of passing B is 100%, and the probability of passing b is 100%.\n\nTherefore, each bird in the F2 generation must carry both alleles needed to express both traits. So, every bird will display both red pigment and brown body color because both parents contribute C and B respectively. Therefore, all four phenotypes would occur equally. But looking back at the answer choices, none of them show all four phenotypes with equal counts. Instead, the options vary in how the phenotypes are grouped.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all birds will display both traits. Let me double-check. For each gene, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. Since each parent contributes only one allele for each gene, the possible alleles passed are fixed. For example, for gene C, Parent 1 passes C, Parent 2 passes c. So each bird will inherit C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in Cc. Similarly, for gene B, Parent 1 passes B, Parent 2 passes b, so each bird will inherit B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in Bb. Combining these, each bird's genotype is CcBb. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For pigment color (C): C is dominant, so all birds will have red pigment. For body color (B): B is dominant, so all birds will have brown body color. Therefore, all F2 birds will display both traits: red pigment and brown body color. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for each phenotype, but this isn't reflected in the answer choices. This suggests that my understanding might be incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the phenotypic expression based on the presence of at least one dominant allele, but I thought that was already covered. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the possible genotypes and then the phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation's possible genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n- CC Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc BB (c dominant, B dominant)\n- cc Bb (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSince all birds in this generation will have both traits expressed due to dominant alleles, all four phenotypes would occur. However, the answer choices do not reflect this. Let me look at the answer options again:\n\nOptions G to J are various ratios, such as 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option D mentions checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Option A is 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios within each trait category rather than across both traits. That is, perhaps it's counting how many birds have red pigment vs. plain, and brown vs. checkered, without considering the interaction between the two traits. But the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the question again: \"phenotypic ratio\" likely refers to the overall distribution across all phenotypes. Alternatively, it could mean the distribution within each trait category. Let me try both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Overall phenotypic ratio (considering both traits together).\nAs established earlier, all four phenotypes would occur equally, but this isn't represented in the answer choices. Approach 2: Phenotypic ratio within each trait category (e.g., how many have red pigment vs. plain, ignoring color).\n\nIf that's the case, let's see:\n\n- Red pigment (C) over plain (c): All birds have red pigment (since C is dominant), except those who are cc (but in our case, all are Cc or cc). Wait, no\u2014all birds have C from Parent 1, so all have pigment red. Therefore, all would have red pigment, making the ratio 100% red over plain.\n\nSimilarly, for brown (B) over checkered (b):\n\n- Brown (B) over checkered (b): All birds have B from Parent 1, so all have brown body color. Therefore, all would have brown, making the ratio 100% brown over checkered.\n\nHowever, neither of these matches the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of each phenotype type, treating each trait separately. Let's count the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1: checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2: checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain brown\n\nAssuming equal numbers of each genotype, each phenotype would have the same frequency. But again, the answer choices suggest different distributions. Looking at option G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total 16 birds. So, in this case, 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Let's verify:\n\nTotal birds in F2 would be 4x4=16, assuming a 1:1:1:1 ratio. If all four phenotypes are equally likely, each would have 4 birds. But option G says checkered red 12, which is higher than 4. That suggests that the calculation may involve some other factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misinterpreted. Let me reconsider the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation. It might be referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to others. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype type, grouping them by their dominant traits.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the question is asking about the ratio of checkered versus plain for each color. For pigment:\n\n- Checkered (c) over plain (C): How many have checkered compared to plain?\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Checkered (b) over brown (B): How many have checkered compared to brown?\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the number of checkered vs. plain for pigment, and similarly for color.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered (c) would come from cc (which includes bb and cb). From the F2 genotype list, the cc individuals are: 25% (cc BB), 25% (cc Bb), 25% (cc cb), and 25% (cc bb)\u2014no, wait, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nWait, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\nAnd also, any other possible genotypes? No, because F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused F1 and F2. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\nF1: CcBb (heterozygous)\nF2: CcBb x CcBb\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc: leading to CC, Cc, cc\n- Bb x Bb: leading to BB, Bb, bb\nSince these are independent, the combined F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of CC/BB, Cc/Bb, cc/bb. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nThese are the four phenotypes. Assuming a 1:1:1:1 distribution, each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Let's look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Total 16. So, 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nHmm, the sum of all phenotypes in each option equals 16. Let's calculate for option G:\n\nCheckered red (12) + checkered brown (2) + plain red (2) + plain brown (2) = 18. That's too high because there are only 16 birds in total. Therefore, option G is invalid.\n\nOption E: 3+9+1+3=16. That adds up correctly. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nBut why would checkered brown be more than checkered red? Let's recalculate:\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the checkered phenotypes are derived from the cc and bb genotypes. The cc and bb can produce checkered (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc Bb) and plain (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, cc Bb). Wait, no\u2014the correct way is:\n\n- The checkered phenotype comes from having at least one recessive allele for each gene. So, for each gene, if the individual is cc or cc, they are checkered. For each gene, if they have B or b, they are brown.\n\nThus, the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive (cc) plus when one gene is recessive and the other is dominant. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is that a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for pigment color, a bird is red if they have at least one C allele. Similarly, for body color, a bird is brown if they have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype occurs when:\n\n- Either cc (regardless of B) or cc (regardless of B), but wait, no. Actually, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one recessive allele for both genes. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The checkered phenotype occurs when the bird is not displaying either trait fully. So, for pigment, it's checkered when they have at least one c allele, and for body, checkered when they have at least one b allele. Therefore, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one c and at least one b allele. But that's impossible because an individual can't have both c and b alleles simultaneously. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, that's incorrect. The checkered phenotype occurs when the bird is not expressing either trait fully. So, for pigment color, it's checkered when they have at least one c allele, and for body color, it's checkered when they have at least one b allele. Therefore, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they have at least one c and at least one b allele. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate because an individual can't have both c and b alleles at the same time. So, a bird is checkered (plain) only if they are cc (for pigment) and bb (for body), i.e., they have both recessive alleles for both genes. In all other cases, they have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus expressing both traits. Therefore, the only way to be checkered is to have cc and bb, which is 1/16 of the population. Any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will have both traits expressed, hence appearing as red and brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Only 1 bird out of 16 will be checkered (cc and bb), so checkered phenotype: 1 bird.\n- The remaining 15 birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, thus appearing as red and brown.\n\nNow, within these 15, how are they distributed between checkered and plain? Well, the checkered phenotype (plain) is only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). So, that's 1 bird. The rest (15 birds) will have at least one dominant allele in each gene, so their phenotypes are red and brown.\n\nWithin these 15, how many have red and how many have brown? Let's see:\n\nEach bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, the number of red (pigment) and brown (body) alleles will depend on the specific genotypes.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n- cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 all red and brown \u2192 phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nAdditionally, there are other possible genotypes if F1 produces different gametes. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F1 x F1 would produce F2 as follows:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the C locus (pigment), F1 is Cc, so gametes are C and c. For the B locus (color), F1 is Bb, so gametes are B and b. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 leading to:\n\n  - CC (C from Cc and C from Bb)\n  - Cc (C from Cc and b from Bb)\n  - cC (c from Cc and C from Bb)\n  - cc (c from Cc and c from Bb)\n\nWait, but since Cc x Bb leads to:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 phenotype 2\n- CC bb \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain)\n- Cc BB \u2192 phenotype 4\n- Cc Bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- Cc bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- cc BB \u2192 phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 phenotype 5\n- cc bb \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: checkered red (only CC BB and CC Bb and",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, each bird can only have one of the two traits based on the dominant allele.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, each bird can only have one of the two traits based on the dominant allele. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: For pigment color (gene C):\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n\nFor body color (gene B):\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird has two traits: pigment and body. The phenotype combines both. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): c recessive, B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Both recessive.\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Assuming independence, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. P(Pigment red) * P(Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 This can't be right because it suggests 100% chance of both traits, which isn't true. Instead, I think I made a mistake in how to combine the probabilities. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The probability that a bird has a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. \n\nWait, no. Each trait is determined by a separate gene. So the presence of a dominant allele for one gene doesn't affect the other. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C) and brown (B) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which is impossible because it would imply 100% of the population has both traits. That must mean my understanding is flawed. Let me try again. Perhaps I need to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the alleles at both loci. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. C_b_b_: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. c_B_: Plain (c) and brown (B)\n4. c_b_b_: Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding genotype combinations. Since the parents are homozygous (for each gene), all their offspring will inherit those alleles. So, for each gene, the alleles are passed on independently. Therefore, the probability for each phenotype is calculated by considering all possible combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nLet me list all possible offspring genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. From Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\nEach gamete from Parent 1 is CB, and from Parent 2 is cb. So the F1 genotypes are CcBb.\n\nNow, F1 selfing (F2):\n\nPossible gametes from F1 (CcBb): CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc BB (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc BB (probability 25%)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each F1 produces two types of gametes: CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc BB (25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered (c) and brown (B)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Checkered (c) and brown (B)\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to them. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1: Cc BB \u2192 occurs when CB gamete is paired with CB or cb. So 25% + 25% = 50%\nPhenotype 2: Cc Bb \u2192 occurs when CB gamete is paired with cb. So 25%\nPhenotype 3: cc bb \u2192 occurs when cb gamete is paired with cb. So 25%\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the probabilities of each trait being dominant, but now it seems more straightforward to look at the actual genotypes and their frequencies. So in F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 50%: Pigment red and brown (Cc BB)\n- 25%: Pigment red and checkered (Cc Bb)\n- 25%: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 50% \u2192 6 (assuming 12 individuals)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% \u2192 3\n- Plain and checkered: 25% \u2192 3\n\nWait, but looking back, the options given are different. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (Cc BB): 50% of F2\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc Bb): 25%\n3. Plain and checkered (cc bb): 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50 : 25 : 25, which simplifies to 2 : 1 : 1. But none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6 checkered, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 pigmented red?\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 8 red, 4 brown, 0 checkered, 4 plain?\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 9 checkered, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain red?\nWait, no, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems off because if the phenotypic ratio were 9:3:3:1, then each category would represent the different genotypic ratios. But according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 50% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, and plain checkered respectively. None of the options directly reflect this. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the options, option J says 2,6,3,9 for checkered red, plain red, plain brown, and checkered brown. Wait, that doesn't align. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown. That's 1+3+9+3=16, which could correspond to 1:3:9:3, which is a 4x4 grid, suggesting that perhaps the options are misinterpreted. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the actual counts of each phenotype, not the ratio. For example, option E says 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That adds up to 16. But according to my previous analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1, so expecting 8:4:4:4, but that's not among the options either. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That sums up to 16, which is 2:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options match this exactly. Looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which is 6:1:1:0. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, ratio 5:3:2:6. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. Not matching.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, ratio 7:5:1:3. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 16. Doesn't add up.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype: Checkered red (since c is recessive and B is dominant)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Plain checkered\n\nEach of these genotypes has a certain frequency. Since the F2 generation consists of 25% of each genotype, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of F2 \u2192 4 out of 16 if F2 has 16 individuals.\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain checkered: 25% \u2192 4\nTotal: 12 out of 16, which is 3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include this exact ratio. Looking again:\n\nOption H mentions checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Ratios are 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 3:3:1. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total, ratio 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a 4x4 grid where each diagonal is 1,3,9,3. This suggests a different way of counting phenotypes, possibly based on actual genotype counts rather than phenotype counts. For instance, the phenotype 'checkered' includes both Cc BB and Cc Bb, while 'plain' includes only cc bb. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc BB \u2192 1/4 of F2 \u2192 4\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 1/4 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: only cc bb \u2192 1/4 \u2192 4\n- Plain brown: none, since B is always dominant in the F2 generation\nBut according to option H, checkered brown is 3, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the counts without normalization, just the numbers, regardless of the sum. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the options are indicating the count of each phenotype in terms of the number of flies, but considering the actual counts based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should consider the standard Mendelian ratios. In the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. However, in reality, due to incomplete dominance or other factors, the ratios may differ. But according to the standard calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, looking at the options, none directly state this. The closest is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That totals 16, and the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which is 6:1:1:0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering the actual genotype counts instead of phenotypes. For example, the number of Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc., which would lead to specific phenotype counts. In F2, the number of each genotype is 1:2:1:2 for the four phenotypes, but that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresenting the phenotypic counts.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear alignment with the options, I'll have to choose based on what makes sense. According to my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that exactly. Option G is the closest, showing 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit, as it implies a different ratio. Option J is 2,6,3,9, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is a 1:3:9:3 ratio, implying a different distribution.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me try again. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype: Plain brown\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Plain checkered\n\nEach of these occurs in 25% of the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% each, totaling 100%, so 4 parts. To normalize, we can say 4:4:4:4, which reduces to 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't have this. Option H states 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. If we take the counts as 5,3,2,6, that's a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the actual counts of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes. If that's the case, each phenotype would occur 4 times out of 16, giving a ratio of 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says 2,6,3,9, which sums to 20, but the question likely expects 16. Option H sums to 16 as well. Without further clarity, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the most logical outcome. My earlier conclusion was that the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match exactly, I'll select the one that best represents the expected distribution, which might be option G, but upon closer inspection, it's unclear why. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely confident. Given the time I've invested, I think the intended answer is option J, but I'm not fully sure.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Although this doesn't perfectly align with the 1:1:1:1 ratio, it's the closest among the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, each bird can only have one of the two traits based on the dominant allele. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: For pigment color (gene C):\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n\nFor body color (gene B):\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird has two traits: pigment and body. The phenotype combines both. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): c recessive, B dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Both recessive.\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Assuming independence, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. P(Pigment red) * P(Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 This can't be right because it suggests 100% chance of both traits, which isn't true. Instead, I think I made a mistake in how to combine the probabilities. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The probability that a bird has a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. \n\nWait, no. Each trait is determined by a separate gene. So the presence of a dominant allele for one gene doesn't affect the other. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities of each trait. For example, the probability of having pigment red (C) and brown (B) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, which is impossible because it would imply 100% of the population has both traits. That must mean my understanding is flawed. Let me try again. Perhaps I need to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the alleles at both loci. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. C_b_b_: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. c_B_: Plain (c) and brown (B)\n4. c_b_b_: Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding genotype combinations. Since the parents are homozygous (for each gene), all their offspring will inherit those alleles. So, for each gene, the alleles are passed on independently. Therefore, the probability for each phenotype is calculated by considering all possible combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nLet me list all possible offspring genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. From Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\nEach gamete from Parent 1 is CB, and from Parent 2 is cb. So the F1 genotypes are CcBb.\n\nNow, F1 selfing (F2):\n\nPossible gametes from F1 (CcBb): CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc BB (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc BB (probability 25%)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each F1 produces two types of gametes: CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc BB (25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered (c) and brown (B)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Checkered (c) and brown (B)\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to them. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1: Cc BB \u2192 occurs when CB gamete is paired with CB or cb. So 25% + 25% = 50%\nPhenotype 2: Cc Bb \u2192 occurs when CB gamete is paired with cb. So 25%\nPhenotype 3: cc bb \u2192 occurs when cb gamete is paired with cb. So 25%\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the probabilities of each trait being dominant, but now it seems more straightforward to look at the actual genotypes and their frequencies. So in F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 50%: Pigment red and brown (Cc BB)\n- 25%: Pigment red and checkered (Cc Bb)\n- 25%: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 50% \u2192 6 (assuming 12 individuals)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25% \u2192 3\n- Plain and checkered: 25% \u2192 3\n\nWait, but looking back, the options given are different. Let me recount:\n\nIn F2, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (Cc BB): 50% of F2\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc Bb): 25%\n3. Plain and checkered (cc bb): 25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50 : 25 : 25, which simplifies to 2 : 1 : 1. But none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6 checkered, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 pigmented red?\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 8 red, 4 brown, 0 checkered, 4 plain?\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 9 checkered, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain red?\nWait, no, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems off because if the phenotypic ratio were 9:3:3:1, then each category would represent the different genotypic ratios. But according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 50% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, and 25% plain checkered. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, and plain checkered respectively. None of the options directly reflect this. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the options, option J says 2,6,3,9 for checkered red, plain red, plain brown, and checkered brown. Wait, that doesn't align. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown. That's 1+3+9+3=16, which could correspond to 1:3:9:3, which is a 4x4 grid, suggesting that perhaps the options are misinterpreted. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the actual counts of each phenotype, not the ratio. For example, option E says 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That adds up to 16. But according to my previous analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1, so expecting 8:4:4:4, but that's not among the options either. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That sums up to 16, which is 2:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options match this exactly. Looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 16, but the ratio is 12:2:2:0, which is 6:1:1:0. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, ratio 5:3:2:6. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1. Not matching.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, ratio 7:5:1:3. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 16. Doesn't add up.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype: Checkered red (since c is recessive and B is dominant)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype: Plain checkered\n\nEach of these genotypes has a certain frequency. Since the F2 generation consists of 25% of each genotype, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of F2 \u2192 4 out of 16 if F2 has 16 individuals.\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain checkered: 25% \u2192 4\nTotal: 12 out of 16, which is 3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include this exact ratio. Looking again:\n\nOption H mentions checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16. Ratios are 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 3:3:1. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total, ratio 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a 4x4 grid where each diagonal is 1,3,9,3.

For instance, the phenotype 'checkered' includes both Cc BB and Cc Bb, while 'plain' includes only cc bb. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc BB \u2192 1/4 of F2 \u2192 4\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 1/4 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: only cc bb \u2192 1/4 \u2192 4\n- Plain brown: none, since B is always dominant in the F2 generation\nBut according to option H, checkered brown is 3, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the counts without normalization, just the numbers, regardless of the sum. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the options are indicating the count of each phenotype in terms of the number of flies, but considering the actual counts based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should consider the standard Mendelian ratios.

For example, the number of Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc., which would lead to specific phenotype counts. In F2, the number of each genotype is 1:2:1:2 for the four phenotypes, but that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresenting the phenotypic counts.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear alignment with the options, I'll have to choose based on what makes sense. According to my earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that exactly.

Option H states 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. If we take the counts as 5,3,2,6, that's a ratio of 5:3:2:6, which doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the actual counts of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes. If that's the case, each phenotype would occur 4 times out of 16, giving a ratio of 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says 2,6,3,9, which sums to 20, but the question likely expects 16. Option H sums to 16 as well. Without further clarity, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the most logical outcome. My earlier conclusion was that the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options match exactly, I'll select the one that best represents the expected distribution, which might be option G, but upon closer inspection, it's unclear why. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely confident. Given the time I've invested, I think the intended answer is option J, but I'm not fully sure.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Although this doesn't perfectly align with the 1:1:1:1 ratio, it's the closest among the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait. So for example:\n\n- If C is dominant (so pigment is red) AND B is dominant (so color is brown), then the bird has both traits.\n- If C is dominant BUT B is recessive (so color is checkered), then the bird has red pigment but no brown color.\n- Similarly for the other combinations.\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, no brown (just plain)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigment no red (plain), brown\n4. Both recessive: Pigment plain and plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because if C is recessive (c), then the pigment is plain regardless of B. Similarly, if B is recessive (b), the color is plain regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): both dominant \u2192 red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and color plain (B recessive): red, plain\n3. Pigment plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant): plain, brown\n4. Pigment plain (C recessive) and color plain (B recessive): plain, plain\n\nNow, what's the probability for each of these?\n\nFor the C locus: P(C) = 1/2, P(c) = 1/2\n\nFor the B locus: P(B) = 1/2, P(b) = 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, but that can't be right because each bird must have one phenotype. Hmm, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. Each bird has two traits, so the four phenotypes cover all possible combinations. Therefore, each phenotype occurs with a probability of 1/4. But wait, that seems too simple. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are categorized differently. Let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to consider all possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for C and two for B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (pale checkered)\n- Cc (checkered)\n- cc (pure checkered)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB (bright checkered)\n- Bb (checkered)\n- bb (pure checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc), the bird is Pigmented.\n- If B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is Brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both Pigmented (C) and Brown (B): Pigmented Brown\n2. Pigmented (C) but not Brown (b): Pigmented Plain\n3. Not Pigmented (c) but Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Neither Pigmented nor Brown: Plain Plain\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the likelihood of each gene being dominant.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(Pigmented) = P(CC) + P(Cc) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n- P(Not Pigmented) = P(cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(Brown) = P(BB) + P(Bb) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n- P(Plain) = P(bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigmented and Plain: (1/2)*(1/4) = 1/8\n3. Plain and Brown: (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8\n4. Plain and Plain: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigmented Brown: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented Plain: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Plain: 1/16\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG.

Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nL. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nM. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nN. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nO. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nP. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nQ. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nWait, option K says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But according to my calculation, the plain brown phenotype isn't zero\u2014it's 1/16. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, no\u2014the initial description was a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but actually, when making the Punnett square, each F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each combination: CC (from CB+CB), Cc (from CB+cb), cc (from cb+cb), and bb (from cb+cb). Wait, but that's not correct because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the gametes would be CB and cb, each with 50% probability. Thus, the F2 would have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB+CB)\n2. Cc (from CB+cb)\n3. cc (from cb+cb)\n4. bb (from cb+cb)\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would have:\n\n- From CB gametes: CcBb (but wait, no\u2014the F2 is the offspring, which comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 would have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. The F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb (each 50%). So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nBut wait, that's not possible because the F2 should include all combinations of the F1's alleles. So the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. Now, mapping these to phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- CC: Pigmented (C is dominant), Plain (B is recessive)\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nSo now, let's determine the phenotypic ratios. Each genotype has a certain probability based on the F1's genotype and the Punnett square. The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete CB and cb occur at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (because the F1 cannot produce bb gametes; wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so when it crosses, it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in the F2.)\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc (from CB\u00d7cb)\n- cc (from cb\u00d7cb)\n- bb (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypic ratios are determined by the number of each phenotype. Each F2 genotype contributes to the next generation. So let's compute the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: This includes CC, Cc, and cc. Wait, no\u2014CC is Pigmented and Plain, Cc is Pigmented and Plain, and cc is Plain and Pigmented. So all three genotypes contribute to Pigmented and Plain. Only bb is Plain and Plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: 3/4\n- Plain and Pigmented: 1/4\n- Plain and Plain: 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the F2 should have all four phenotypes, but according to this, only two phenotypes exist. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014the F2 can have four phenotypes, but perhaps some are less common due to genetic factors. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the actual number of individuals rather than percentages.\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. In the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance of being CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb (wait, no\u2014if the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have a 25% chance of being CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb? Wait, no\u2014because F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes, so when crossed, the F2 would have the following:\n\n- 25% CC (both genes dominant)\n- 50% Cc (one dominant, one recessive)\n- 25% cc (both genes recessive)\n- 0% bb (no, wait, F1 can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2)\n\nWait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, that's not correct because F2 should include all combinations of the F1's alleles. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since F1 can't produce bb gametes; wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2)\n\nWait, no\u2014F1 can produce cb gametes, so when F1 selfs, the F2 genotype for the B locus would be:\n\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- Bb (from cb \u00d7 Cc?)\n\nNo, wait, F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the F2 for the B locus would be:\n\n- B: dominant (B) occurs when B is present in the gamete.\n- bb occurs when b is present in the gamete.\n\nSo for the B locus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- B_: dominant (BB or Bb)\n- bb: recessive (bb)\n\nThe same logic applies to the C locus. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two loci.\n\nSo the phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): Pigmented Brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented Plain\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain Brown\n- Both recessive: Plain Plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb (but wait, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2). Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 25% each for the first three phenotypes and 0% for the fourth. But that contradicts the earlier assumption where all four phenotypes were present. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the F2 generation forms. Let me think again.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n- bb (0%)\n\nBecause F1 is a heterozygote for both genes, the F2 will have:\n\n- For each gene:\n  - Dominant (C or B) \u2192 presence\n  - Recessive (c or b) \u2192 absence\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not. So the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Plain: CC, Cc, and cc (since C is present in all cases except bb, and B is absent in cc)\n2. Plain and Pigmented: None, because only cc has B absent, but C is present in cc. Wait, no\u2014cc has both genes recessive, so it's Plain and Plain.\n3. Pigmented and Pigmented: All cases where C is present and B is present.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Pigmented, Plain\n2. Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n3. cc: Plain, Pigmented\n4. bb: Plain, Plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: CC, Cc, and cc \u2192 75% (25% + 50% + 25%)\n- Plain and Pigmented: None, because all F2 have at least one dominant allele for one gene, except when it's cc, which has a recessive allele for both.\n- Plain and Plain: bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the F2 generation should have all four phenotypes, but according to this, only two are present. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird can be:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain (has C dominant, no B)\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain (has C dominant, has B recessive)\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented (has no C dominant, has B dominant)\n- bb: Plain, Plain (no C dominant, no B dominant)\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, but according to the counts above, only three have Pigmented or Plain. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Plain (only possible when C is dominant and B is recessive)\n2. Plain and Pigmented (only possible when C is recessive and B is dominant)\n3. Pigmented and Pigmented (only possible when C is dominant and B is dominant)\n4. Plain and Plain (only possible when C is recessive and B is recessive)\n\nSo in the F2 generation, each bird falls into one of these four phenotypes based on their genotype. Now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: Frequency is 25% (for CC) + 50% (for Cc) + 25% (for cc) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014CC is Pigmented and Plain, C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait. So for example:\n\n- If C is dominant (so pigment is red) AND B is dominant (so color is brown), then the bird has both traits.\n- If C is dominant BUT B is recessive (so color is checkered), then the bird has red pigment but no brown color.\n- Similarly for the other combinations.\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, no brown (just plain)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigment no red (plain), brown\n4. Both recessive: Pigment plain and plain\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because if C is recessive (c), then the pigment is plain regardless of B. Similarly, if B is recessive (b), the color is plain regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): both dominant \u2192 red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and color plain (B recessive): red, plain\n3. Pigment plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant): plain, brown\n4. Pigment plain (C recessive) and color plain (B recessive): plain, plain\n\nNow, what's the probability for each of these?\n\nFor the C locus: P(C) = 1/2, P(c) = 1/2\n\nFor the B locus: P(B) = 1/2, P(b) = 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, but that can't be right because each bird must have one phenotype. Hmm, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. Each bird has two traits, so the four phenotypes cover all possible combinations. Therefore, each phenotype occurs with a probability of 1/4. But wait, that seems too simple. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are categorized differently. Let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to consider all possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for C and two for B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (pale checkered)\n- Cc (checkered)\n- cc (pure checkered)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB (bright checkered)\n- Bb (checkered)\n- bb (pure checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc), the bird is Pigmented.\n- If B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is Brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both Pigmented (C) and Brown (B): Pigmented Brown\n2. Pigmented (C) but not Brown (b): Pigmented Plain\n3. Not Pigmented (c) but Brown (B): Plain Brown\n4. Neither Pigmented nor Brown: Plain Plain\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the likelihood of each gene being dominant.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(Pigmented) = P(CC) + P(Cc) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n- P(Not Pigmented) = P(cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(Brown) = P(BB) + P(Bb) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n- P(Plain) = P(bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n1. Pigmented and Brown: (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigmented and Plain: (1/2)*(1/4) = 1/8\n3. Plain and Brown: (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8\n4. Plain and Plain: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pigmented Brown: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented Plain: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Plain: 1/16\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nL. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nM. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nN. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nO. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nP. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nQ. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nWait, option K says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But according to my calculation, the plain brown phenotype isn't zero\u2014it's 1/16. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, no\u2014the initial description was a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but actually, when making the Punnett square, each F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each combination: CC (from CB+CB), Cc (from CB+cb), cc (from cb+cb), and bb (from cb+cb). Wait, but that's not correct because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the gametes would be CB and cb, each with 50% probability. Thus, the F2 would have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB+CB)\n2. Cc (from CB+cb)\n3. cc (from cb+cb)\n4. bb (from cb+cb)\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would have:\n\n- From CB gametes: CcBb (but wait, no\u2014the F2 is the offspring, which comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 would have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. The F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb (each 50%). So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nBut wait, that's not possible because the F2 should include all combinations of the F1's alleles. So the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, bb. Now, mapping these to phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n- CC: Pigmented (C is dominant), Plain (B is recessive)\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nSo now, let's determine the phenotypic ratios. Each genotype has a certain probability based on the F1's genotype and the Punnett square. The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete CB and cb occur at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (because the F1 cannot produce bb gametes; wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so when it crosses, it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in the F2.)\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc (from CB\u00d7cb)\n- cc (from cb\u00d7cb)\n- bb (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypic ratios are determined by the number of each phenotype. Each F2 genotype contributes to the next generation. So let's compute the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: This includes CC, Cc, and cc. Wait, no\u2014CC is Pigmented and Plain, Cc is Pigmented and Plain, and cc is Plain and Pigmented. So all three genotypes contribute to Pigmented and Plain. Only bb is Plain and Plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: 3/4\n- Plain and Pigmented: 1/4\n- Plain and Plain: 0%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the F2 should have all four phenotypes, but according to this, only two phenotypes exist. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014the F2 can have four phenotypes, but perhaps some are less common due to genetic factors. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the actual number of individuals rather than percentages.\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. In the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance of being CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb (wait, no\u2014if the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have a 25% chance of being CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb? Wait, no\u2014because F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes, so when crossed, the F2 would have the following:\n\n- 25% CC (both genes dominant)\n- 50% Cc (one dominant, one recessive)\n- 25% cc (both genes recessive)\n- 0% bb (no, wait, F1 can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2)\n\nWait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, that's not correct because F2 should include all combinations of the F1's alleles. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since F1 can't produce bb gametes; wait, no\u2014F1 is CcBb, so it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2)\n\nWait, no\u2014F1 can produce cb gametes, so when F1 selfs, the F2 genotype for the B locus would be:\n\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- Bb (from cb \u00d7 Cc?)\n\nNo, wait, F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the F2 for the B locus would be:\n\n- B: dominant (B) occurs when B is present in the gamete.\n- bb occurs when b is present in the gamete.\n\nSo for the B locus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- B_: dominant (BB or Bb)\n- bb: recessive (bb)\n\nThe same logic applies to the C locus. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two loci.\n\nSo the phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): Pigmented Brown\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented Plain\n- C recessive, B dominant: Plain Brown\n- Both recessive: Plain Plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc, and 0% bb (but wait, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce cb gametes, leading to cc in F2). Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented\n- bb: Plain, Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 25% each for the first three phenotypes and 0% for the fourth. But that contradicts the earlier assumption where all four phenotypes were present. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the F2 generation forms. Let me think again.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n- bb (0%)\n\nBecause F1 is a heterozygote for both genes, the F2 will have:\n\n- For each gene:\n  - Dominant (C or B) \u2192 presence\n  - Recessive (c or b) \u2192 absence\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present or not. So the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Plain: CC, Cc, and cc (since C is present in all cases except bb, and B is absent in cc)\n2. Plain and Pigmented: None, because only cc has B absent, but C is present in cc. Wait, no\u2014cc has both genes recessive, so it's Plain and Plain.\n3. Pigmented and Pigmented: All cases where C is present and B is present.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Pigmented, Plain\n2. Cc: Pigmented, Plain\n3. cc: Plain, Pigmented\n4. bb: Plain, Plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: CC, Cc, and cc \u2192 75% (25% + 50% + 25%)\n- Plain and Pigmented: None, because all F2 have at least one dominant allele for one gene, except when it's cc, which has a recessive allele for both.\n- Plain and Plain: bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the F2 generation should have all four phenotypes, but according to this, only two are present. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird can be:\n\n- CC: Pigmented, Plain (has C dominant, no B)\n- Cc: Pigmented, Plain (has C dominant, has B recessive)\n- cc: Plain, Pigmented (has no C dominant, has B dominant)\n- bb: Plain, Plain (no C dominant, no B dominant)\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, but according to the counts above, only three have Pigmented or Plain. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and Plain (only possible when C is dominant and B is recessive)\n2. Plain and Pigmented (only possible when C is recessive and B is dominant)\n3. Pigmented and Pigmented (only possible when C is dominant and B is dominant)\n4. Plain and Plain (only possible when C is recessive and B is recessive)\n\nSo in the F2 generation, each bird falls into one of these four phenotypes based on their genotype. Now, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented and Plain: Frequency is 25% (for CC) + 50% (for Cc) + 25% (for cc) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014CC is Pigmented and Plain, C",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

Therefore, for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So F1 has C and c for C.\n- Gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F1 has B and b for B.\n\nThus, F1 has genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate.\n\nThe F2 will inherit two copies of each gene from F1.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being C (parent 1) and 50% chance of being c (parent 2).\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being B (parent 1) and 50% chance of being b (parent 2).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations for F2:\n\n1.

Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the probability of receiving a dominant allele is 2/3 for C (since in F1, the probability of having C is 2/3, and similarly for B). Wait, but that's not accurate because F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes one allele. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of inheriting a dominant allele is higher than recessive. For example, for Gene C, in F1 (CcBb), the probability of passing on C is 2/3 (since there are two C alleles in F1: one from each parent?), wait no, F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes one allele. Wait, F1 is CcBb, so the genotype is Cc for C and Bb for B. So for Gene C, the probability of passing on C is 1/2 (from each parent contributing C), and for c is 1/2 (from each parent contributing c). Similarly for Gene B, the probability of passing on B is 1/2 and b is 1/2.\n\nWait, but for the F2, each gene is inherited from two different parents. So for Gene C, the F2 genotype is:\n\n- CC (from CB and CB)\n- Cc (from CB and cb)\n- cc (from cb and cb)\n\nSimilarly for Gene B.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown.\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 2/3 (since F1 is Cc, each gamete has a 1/2 chance of C and 1/2 of c)\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 2/3 (since F1 is Bb, each gamete has a 1/2 chance of B and 1/2 of b)\nSo, Phenotype 1 = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nFor Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered.\n- Pigment red = 2/3\n- Checkered = 1/3 (since only 1/3 chance of passing on b)\nSo Phenotype 2 = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nFor Phenotype 3: Plain and brown.\n- Plain = 1/3\n- Brown = 2/3\nSo Phenotype 3 = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nFor Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered.\n- Plain = 1/3\n- Checkered = 1/3\nSo Phenotype 4 = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to my calculations, checkered red is Phenotype 3: 2/9, checkered brown is Phenotype 4: 1/9. But option D has checkered red as 1 and checkered brown as 3, which would correspond to 3/9 and 1/9, which doesn't match our calculations. Option A has checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16, which isn't 9. Option B has checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, etc. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which doesn't add up. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc., which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the calculation.\n\nWait, the F2 phenotypes are based on the combination of the alleles passed from each parent. Each gene is independent, so the probabilities are multiplied. So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 2/3, recessive is 1/3.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, or simplified to 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly matches this. However, option A has checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That sums to 16. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc., summing to 1+3+9+3=16. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, summing to 12. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc., summing to 14. None seem to match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question uses a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 population without considering dominance probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each bird has a certain number of offspring, leading to a specific ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J, which has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12. But according to our calculations, the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to option A (assuming checkered red is 4, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2). But option A lists checkered red as 6, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definition of \"checkered.\" The question defines \"checkered\" as recessive (bb), while \"plain\" is dominant (CC). So in the phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and checkered: C and b \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain and brown: c and B \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain and checkered: c and b \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIn terms of dominance, the phenotype 1 includes both dominant traits, while phenotype 4 includes the recessive trait.\n\nNow, if we consider that each bird has two copies of each gene, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the dominant and recessive alleles. In F2, each phenotype has a certain frequency based on the Punnett square.\n\nGiven the correct probabilities, the phenotypic ratio should be 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which sums to 12. This could imply that the question considers the number of each phenotype without accounting for dominance probabilities, treating each bird as having a fixed number of offspring, leading to a ratio where checkered red is twice as common as checkered brown, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations without considering dominance, which might lead to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option J, which is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This totals 12. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which would be option D, but that doesn't match the math.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts the number of each phenotype based on the number of possible combinations without considering dominance. For example, in F2, the number of each phenotype could be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B): 4 out of 9\n- Phenotype 2 (C and b): 2 out of 9\n- Phenotype 3 (c and B): 2 out of 9\n- Phenotype 4 (c and b): 1 out of 9\n\nIf we consider the number of offspring, say 9 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4\n- Phenotype 2: 2\n- Phenotype 3: 2\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nWhich would translate to checkered red 4, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 1. But none of the options match this except possibly option J, which sums to 12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to checkered red being twice as common as checkered brown, etc. But that doesn't align with the standard genetic calculations.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for an option that reflects the dominance ratios. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This suggests that in the F2, there are 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16, but that doesn't account for all possible combinations properly.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option A might be correct if we miscounted.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the ratio of the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the number of ways each phenotype can occur. For instance, the number of checkered red birds would be the number of individuals with both C and B alleles, which is 4 out of 9, so 4/9 of the F2 population would be checkered red. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut without knowing the exact population size, it's hard to determine the ratio of counts. However, among the options, option J sums to 12, which might correspond to a hypothetical scenario where each bird has a fixed number of offspring, leading to 12 total birds, but I'm not certain.\n\nI think I've spent enough time on this, and based on the calculations, the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option A may be correct if we consider that checkered red includes both checkered and plain, but I don't see why.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct answer is option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Because in the F2, the number of checkered red (both C and B) is 4 out of 9, but scaled to a total of 12, it becomes 6, and similarly for the others. But I'm not fully certain, so I'll go with option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype depend on the combination of alleles received from each parent.\n\nParent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B.\nParent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b.\n\nSo the F1 will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. Therefore, for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So F1 has C and c for C.\n- Gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F1 has B and b for B.\n\nThus, F1 has genotype CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate.\n\nThe F2 will inherit two copies of each gene from F1.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being C (parent 1) and 50% chance of being c (parent 2).\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being B (parent 1) and 50% chance of being b (parent 2).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations for F2:\n\n1. CC (C from parent 1, C from parent 2) and BB (B from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n2. CC (C from parent 1, C from parent 2) and Bb (B from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n3. cc (c from parent 1, c from parent 2) and BB (B from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n4. cc (c from parent 1, c from parent 2) and Bb (B from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n\nWait, but this approach seems off. Instead, considering that each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of these. The four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (from Cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown\n2. C (from Cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered\n3. cc (from cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and brown\n4. cc (from cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B)\n- Probability = (Probability of Cc) * (Probability of Bb)\n- Probability of Cc = 2/3 (from CcBb)\n- Probability of Bb = 2/3 (from BbBb)\nWait, no\u2014the actual calculation is:\n\nEach gene has a 2/3 chance of being dominant (since each parent contributes one allele). Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the probability of receiving a dominant allele is 2/3 for C (since in F1, the probability of having C is 2/3, and similarly for B). Wait, but that's not accurate because F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes one allele. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of inheriting a dominant allele is higher than recessive. For example, for Gene C, in F1 (CcBb), the probability of passing on C is 2/3 (since there are two C alleles in F1: one from each parent?), wait no, F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes one allele. Wait, F1 is CcBb, so the genotype is Cc for C and Bb for B. So for Gene C, the probability of passing on C is 1/2 (from each parent contributing C), and for c is 1/2 (from each parent contributing c). Similarly for Gene B, the probability of passing on B is 1/2 and b is 1/2.\n\nWait, but for the F2, each gene is inherited from two different parents. So for Gene C, the F2 genotype is:\n\n- CC (from CB and CB)\n- Cc (from CB and cb)\n- cc (from cb and cb)\n\nSimilarly for Gene B.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown.\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 2/3 (since F1 is Cc, each gamete has a 1/2 chance of C and 1/2 of c)\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 2/3 (since F1 is Bb, each gamete has a 1/2 chance of B and 1/2 of b)\nSo, Phenotype 1 = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nFor Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered.\n- Pigment red = 2/3\n- Checkered = 1/3 (since only 1/3 chance of passing on b)\nSo Phenotype 2 = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nFor Phenotype 3: Plain and brown.\n- Plain = 1/3\n- Brown = 2/3\nSo Phenotype 3 = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nFor Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered.\n- Plain = 1/3\n- Checkered = 1/3\nSo Phenotype 4 = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to my calculations, checkered red is Phenotype 3: 2/9, checkered brown is Phenotype 4: 1/9. But option D has checkered red as 1 and checkered brown as 3, which would correspond to 3/9 and 1/9, which doesn't match our calculations. Option A has checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That adds up to 16, which isn't 9. Option B has checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, etc. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which doesn't add up. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc., which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the calculation.\n\nWait, the F2 phenotypes are based on the combination of the alleles passed from each parent. Each gene is independent, so the probabilities are multiplied. So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 2/3, recessive is 1/3.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1, or simplified to 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly matches this. However, option A has checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That sums to 16. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc., summing to 1+3+9+3=16. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, summing to 12. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc., summing to 14. None seem to match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question uses a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 population without considering dominance probabilities.

For example, in F2, the number of each phenotype could be:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B): 4 out of 9\n- Phenotype 2 (C and b): 2 out of 9\n- Phenotype 3 (c and B): 2 out of 9\n- Phenotype 4 (c and b): 1 out of 9\n\nIf we consider the number of offspring, say 9 birds, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4\n- Phenotype 2: 2\n- Phenotype 3: 2\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nWhich would translate to checkered red 4, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 1. But none of the options match this except possibly option J, which sums to 12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, leading to checkered red being twice as common as checkered brown, etc. But that doesn't align with the standard genetic calculations.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for an option that reflects the dominance ratios. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This suggests that in the F2, there are 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16, but that doesn't account for all possible combinations properly.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option A might be correct if we miscounted.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the ratio of the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the number of ways each phenotype can occur. For instance, the number of checkered red birds would be the number of individuals with both C and B alleles, which is 4 out of 9, so 4/9 of the F2 population would be checkered red. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut without knowing the exact population size, it's hard to determine the ratio of counts. However, among the options, option J sums to 12, which might correspond to a hypothetical scenario where each bird has a fixed number of offspring, leading to 12 total birds, but I'm not certain.\n\nI think I've spent enough time on this, and based on the calculations, the correct ratio should be 4:2:2:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option A may be correct if we consider that checkered red includes both checkered and plain, but I don't see why.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct answer is option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Because in the F2, the number of checkered red (both C and B) is 4 out of 9, but scaled to a total of 12, it becomes 6, and similarly for the others. But I'm not fully certain, so I'll go with option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. Wait, no\u2014wait, the genes determine the traits separately. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it'll be red; similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it'll be brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nEach of these requires specific alleles. The probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nFor the C gene (p=1, q=0):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 pigment red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B gene (p=1, q=0):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are working independently, the overall probabilities combine multiplicatively. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations where both traits are expressed, one trait is expressed, or neither.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because for each gene, the expression is additive. So the bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both dominant: red and brown\n- Only pigment dominant: red and checkered\n- Only body dominant: plain and brown\n- Neither dominant: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the chance that each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele.\n\nSo for pigment (C):\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C makes the bird red)\n- Q(c) = 0\n\nFor body (B):\n- P(B) = 1 (any B makes brown)\n- Q(b) = 0\n\nNow, looking at the possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when C is present (which it always is) AND B is present (always true). So the probability is 1*1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C is present, B is absent (i.e., b). Probability: 1*0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: C is absent (i.e., c), B is present. Probability: 0*1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: C is absent, B is absent. Probability: 0*0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, but that contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Perhaps I made a mistake in how the probabilities work. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the approach. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Since each bird must have both traits unless one is missing, but given that both genes are contributing, every bird will have both traits except when neither is present. But in reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. Otherwise, it won't. So:\n\n- For Pigment red (C) to be present: C allele must be present\n- For Body brown (B) to be present: B allele must be present\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both being present. So all birds will have both traits unless one is missing. But in reality, since each bird has both genes, all will have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect that; instead, the answers suggest different ratios. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the genes act independently, leading to a certain distribution. Wait, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, so the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the number of birds with each trait. Let's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\n- Frequency = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Frequency = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n- Frequency = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c dominant, b dominant)\n- Frequency = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis suggests all four phenotypes occur equally, which isn't among the answer choices. So perhaps my understanding is flawed. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome. For example, if the order of dominance matters, then the phenotypes could be ordered differently. Wait, but the question states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered, regardless of dominance hierarchy within a single gene. So perhaps the presence of any dominant allele in either gene results in the respective trait. Thus, all birds would exhibit both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, but that's not matching the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant for brown, and b is recessive for brown (making it checkered). Similarly, C is dominant for red, and c is recessive for plain (making it checkered). So each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So all birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of phenotypes without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond what's stated. Let me re-examine the question: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Red brown are determined by...\". Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the traits are independent. If the traits are independent, then each bird has a 1/2 chance of having each trait. But with both genes working together, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the combination of traits. Wait, perhaps I should model this differently. Let's consider that each bird has two independent traits, each determined by a separate gene. The presence of dominant alleles in either gene determines the trait. So the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All such birds will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Same as above, but only the checkered trait is expressed.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Only the brown trait is expressed.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Only the checkered trait is expressed.\n\nHowever, this leads to all four phenotypes occurring in the same population, which isn't reflected in the answer choices. Therefore, perhaps the question assumes that the traits are expressed independently, but the possible phenotypic ratios are based on the segregation of each gene. Since each bird has two genes, each segregating into two possible alleles, the F2 generation would involve the segregation of each gene. Let me approach this by considering the F2 generation's genotype ratios first.\n\nIn the F1 generation, all birds are CcBb. When F1 selfs to produce F2, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% ratio. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent (F1) can only produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC\n- From CB + cb: Cc\n- From cb + CB: Cc\n- From cb + cb: cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes can be calculated by considering the combinations of the two loci. Each gene has three phenotypic categories (for each locus), but since the birds have two traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two. However, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios would be 25% for each possible combination of the two traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each trait is determined by a separate gene, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two traits. Since each gene has two possible alleles (dominant or recessive), the phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be present or not. But in this case, since both genes are contributing, all birds will have both traits expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the answer choices. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic presence of dominant alleles, treating each gene independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratios for each gene would be 3:1 (dominant : recessive), but combined, the phenotypic ratios would require multiplication. However, since both genes contribute, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1. But the answer choices don't align with this. Therefore, I must reconsider my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of phenotypes without considering the dominance hierarchy. For instance, if each gene contributes to the trait in a way that the presence of at least one dominant allele is required for the trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly, and the intended method is to use the standard Mendelian dihybrid cross calculation, considering the dominance hierarchy and the resulting phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me try recalculating. The F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which gave a 3:1 ratio (F1: 3, F2: 1). But when considering the dihybrid cross, the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including the recessive ones. To find the phenotypic ratio, I need to calculate the number of each possible phenotype in the F2.\n\nFirst, the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- Cc (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame applies to the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of both traits. Each gene has three possible phenotypic categories, but since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two. However, since both genes are contributing, all birds will have both traits expressed, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match the answer choices. Therefore, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic presence of dominant alleles, treating each gene independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratios for each gene would be 3:1, but combined, the phenotypic ratios would require multiplication. However, since both genes contribute, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1. Therefore, I must conclude that none of the answer choices match my calculations, suggesting a possible error in the question or my interpretation.\n\nUpon reviewing the question again, I realize that the initial description mentions that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). These are the parents for the cross. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 x F1. Wait, no\u2014the question says an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, which would mean the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Crossing them would produce F1 as CcBb, and then F2 would be from F1 selfing. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies the cross itself is adihybrid, implying it's a dihybrid cross already. So perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is obtained by crossing F1 with F1. Therefore, the F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). In this case, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nAgain, since both genes contribute, all birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I must consider that the question may have intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio rather than the F2. Looking back at the options, option D has a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the F1 generation (CcBb) produces a 1:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which fits a dihybrid cross. Therefore, perhaps the question was mistakenly referred to as an adihybrid cross, but it's actually a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, the question may have mixed up terms. Assuming that the correct approach is to analyze the F1 phenotypic ratio, which matches option D, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1, translating to checkered red (1 part), checkered brown (3 parts), plain red (9 parts?), and plain brown (3 parts?). Wait, no\u2014the 1:3:3:1 corresponds to the F1 dihybrid cross, where the phenotypic ratio is 1 (checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 3 (plain red), 1 (plain brown). But according to the options, option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems inconsistent. Option A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit 1:3:3:1. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which seems unrelated. Option H is 5, 3, 2, 6, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2, 6, 3, 1, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7, 5, 1, 3, which doesn't fit either. Option F is 4, 4, 4, 4, which also doesn't fit. Option B is checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. That would imply a 8:4:0:4 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:3:3:1 pattern. Option C is 9, 3, 3, 1, which sums to 16, but the 1:3:3:1 adds up to 8. Therefore, none of the options seem to fit the expected 1:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option D if it's misstated. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation, but the calculations lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't presented. Therefore, I might need to revisit the original assumption.\n\nPerhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would indeed be 1:3:3:1, fitting option D. Therefore, despite the confusion in the question, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question refers to the F1 generation, and thus the correct answer is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. Wait, no\u2014wait, the genes determine the traits separately. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it'll be red; similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it'll be brown. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nEach of these requires specific alleles. The probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nFor the C gene (p=1, q=0):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 pigment red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B gene (p=1, q=0):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince both genes are working independently, the overall probabilities combine multiplicatively. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations where both traits are expressed, one trait is expressed, or neither.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because for each gene, the expression is additive. So the bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Both dominant: red and brown\n- Only pigment dominant: red and checkered\n- Only body dominant: plain and brown\n- Neither dominant: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by determining the chance that each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele.\n\nSo for pigment (C):\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C makes the bird red)\n- Q(c) = 0\n\nFor body (B):\n- P(B) = 1 (any B makes brown)\n- Q(b) = 0\n\nNow, looking at the possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when C is present (which it always is) AND B is present (always true). So the probability is 1*1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C is present, B is absent (i.e., b). Probability: 1*0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: C is absent (i.e., c), B is present. Probability: 0*1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: C is absent, B is absent. Probability: 0*0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, but that contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Perhaps I made a mistake in how the probabilities work. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the approach. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Since each bird must have both traits unless one is missing, but given that both genes are contributing, every bird will have both traits except when neither is present. But in reality, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. Otherwise, it won't. So:\n\n- For Pigment red (C) to be present: C allele must be present\n- For Body brown (B) to be present: B allele must be present\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both being present. So all birds will have both traits unless one is missing. But in reality, since each bird has both genes, all will have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect that; instead, the answers suggest different ratios. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the genes act independently, leading to a certain distribution. Wait, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, so the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by the number of birds with each trait. Let's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\n- Frequency = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Frequency = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n- Frequency = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c dominant, b dominant)\n- Frequency = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nThis suggests all four phenotypes occur equally, which isn't among the answer choices. So perhaps my understanding is flawed. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the outcome. For example, if the order of dominance matters, then the phenotypes could be ordered differently. Wait, but the question states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered, regardless of dominance hierarchy within a single gene. So perhaps the presence of any dominant allele in either gene results in the respective trait. Thus, all birds would exhibit both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, but that's not matching the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant for brown, and b is recessive for brown (making it checkered). Similarly, C is dominant for red, and c is recessive for plain (making it checkered). So each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So all birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of phenotypes without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond what's stated. Let me re-examine the question: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Red brown are determined by...\". Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the traits are independent. If the traits are independent, then each bird has a 1/2 chance of having each trait. But with both genes working together, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the combination of traits. Wait, perhaps I should model this differently. Let's consider that each bird has two independent traits, each determined by a separate gene. The presence of dominant alleles in either gene determines the trait. So the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. The possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All such birds will express both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Same as above, but only the checkered trait is expressed.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Only the brown trait is expressed.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Only the checkered trait is expressed.\n\nHowever, this leads to all four phenotypes occurring in the same population, which isn't reflected in the answer choices. Therefore, perhaps the question assumes that the traits are expressed independently, but the possible phenotypic ratios are based on the segregation of each gene. Since each bird has two genes, each segregating into two possible alleles, the F2 generation would involve the segregation of each gene. Let me approach this by considering the F2 generation's genotype ratios first.\n\nIn the F1 generation, all birds are CcBb. When F1 selfs to produce F2, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% ratio. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent (F1) can only produce CB and cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are formed by combining these. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC\n- From CB + cb: Cc\n- From cb + CB: Cc\n- From cb + cb: cc\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes can be calculated by considering the combinations of the two loci. Each gene has three phenotypic categories (for each locus), but since the birds have two traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two. However, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios would be 25% for each possible combination of the two traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each trait is determined by a separate gene, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two traits. Since each gene has two possible alleles (dominant or recessive), the phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be present or not. But in this case, since both genes are contributing, all birds will have both traits expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the answer choices. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic presence of dominant alleles, treating each gene independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratios for each gene would be 3:1 (dominant : recessive), but combined, the phenotypic ratios would require multiplication. However, since both genes contribute, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1. But the answer choices don't align with this. Therefore, I must reconsider my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of phenotypes without considering the dominance hierarchy. For instance, if each gene contributes to the trait in a way that the presence of at least one dominant allele is required for the trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly, and the intended method is to use the standard Mendelian dihybrid cross calculation, considering the dominance hierarchy and the resulting phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me try recalculating. The F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which gave a 3:1 ratio (F1: 3, F2: 1). But when considering the dihybrid cross, the F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including the recessive ones. To find the phenotypic ratio, I need to calculate the number of each possible phenotype in the F2.\n\nFirst, the F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- Cc (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame applies to the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nAssuming independence, the F2 phenotypes are combinations of both traits. Each gene has three possible phenotypic categories, but since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of the two. However, since both genes are contributing, all birds will have both traits expressed, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match the answer choices. Therefore, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic presence of dominant alleles, treating each gene independently. In that case, the phenotypic ratios for each gene would be 3:1, but combined, the phenotypic ratios would require multiplication. However, since both genes contribute, the phenotypic ratios remain 1:1:1:1. Therefore, I must conclude that none of the answer choices match my calculations, suggesting a possible error in the question or my interpretation.\n\nUpon reviewing the question again, I realize that the initial description mentions that the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). These are the parents for the cross. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 x F1. Wait, no\u2014the question says an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, which would mean the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Crossing them would produce F1 as CcBb, and then F2 would be from F1 selfing. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies the cross itself is adihybrid, implying it's a dihybrid cross already. So perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is obtained by crossing F1 with F1. Therefore, the F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb). In this case, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nAgain, since both genes contribute, all birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, I must consider that the question may have intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio rather than the F2. Looking back at the options, option D has a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that the F1 generation (CcBb) produces a 1:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which fits a dihybrid cross. Therefore, perhaps the question was mistakenly referred to as an adihybrid cross, but it's actually a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, the question may have mixed up terms. Assuming that the correct approach is to analyze the F1 phenotypic ratio, which matches option D, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1, translating to checkered red (1 part), checkered brown (3 parts), plain red (9 parts?), and plain brown (3 parts?). Wait, no\u2014the 1:3:3:1 corresponds to the F1 dihybrid cross, where the phenotypic ratio is 1 (checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 3 (plain red), 1 (plain brown). But according to the options, option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems inconsistent. Option A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit 1:3:3:1. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which seems unrelated. Option H is 5, 3, 2, 6, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2, 6, 3, 1, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7, 5, 1, 3, which doesn't fit either. Option F is 4, 4, 4, 4, which also doesn't fit. Option B is checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. That would imply a 8:4:0:4 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:3:3:1 pattern. Option C is 9, 3, 3, 1, which sums to 16, but the 1:3:3:1 adds up to 8. Therefore, none of the options seem to fit the expected 1:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option D if it's misstated. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation, but the calculations lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't presented. Therefore, I might need to revisit the original assumption.\n\nPerhaps the question intended to ask about the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would indeed be 1:3:3:1, fitting option D. Therefore, despite the confusion in the question, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question refers to the F1 generation, and thus the correct answer is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

    "chunk_resampled": "But if either gene is recessive, only one trait will be expressed.",

Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (phenotype RRBB)\nWait, no\u2014I think the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their order. So for pigment red, C is dominant over c, so if C is present, the bird is red. Similarly, for brown, B is dominant over b, so if B is present, the bird is brown. Thus, the phenotypes are combinations where each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown: C and B both present\n- Red and Checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain and Brown: c and B present\n- Plain and Checkered: c and B absent\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigmented Red and Brown (C and B):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have this phenotype?\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because if both genes are dominant, then the bird will display both traits. But if either gene is recessive, only one trait is displayed. However, in this case, since both parents are homozygous for both traits (one is CC BB, the other is cc bb), the F1 generation will always be CcBb, which means both C and B are present. Thus, every F1 bird will have both traits, making the phenotype \"Red and Brown\" for all F1 birds. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because typically, in dihybrid crosses, you get different phenotypes depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are such that all F1 individuals carry the dominant alleles for both genes, so all F1 birds will display both traits. Therefore, the F1 population will be 100% \"Red and Brown.\" Then, when F1 (all Red and Brown) selfs, what happens? Since all F1 birds are R and B, they'll produce gametes that are CR and CB (or whatever the notation is). Wait, but in reality, the alleles are C and B, so the gametes would be CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb. So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. But since all F1s are CcBb, they'll produce CB and cb equally. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have four possible combinations of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the possible F2 genotypes are CC (CB+CB), Cc (CB+cb), cc (cb+cb), and bb (cb+cb). Now, determining the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nThus, all four phenotypes occur in equal numbers (25% each). Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, each phenotype occurs equally often. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly, but option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which is a 3:1:1:1 ratio. Option H mentions 5,3,2,6, which isn't matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which would be a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is 1:3:9:3, suggesting a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but our calculation shows equal distribution across all four phenotypes. So none of the options perfectly match my conclusion. However, looking at the options, option G has four phenotypes with equal counts, but in the given options, the counts don't add up to 16. Wait, 12 + 2 + 2 + 2 equals 18, which is too high. Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the genetic model. Maybe the traits are additive or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds rather than the percentage. In that case, each bird could have one of four phenotypes, so 16 birds would have 4 each, giving a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total number of offspring. If the F2 generation has 16 birds (assuming each parent contributes 8), but that's speculative. Wait, let me count the possible F2 genotypes. From earlier, the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But the actual phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigmented red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs in a 25% ratio among the F2 population. So if the F2 population has 16 birds, then 4 would have each phenotype, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But the options don't include this. Wait, but option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\"\u2014which sums to 18, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014summing to 12, which also doesn't fit. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014summing to 16. That fits perfectly. So in E, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16 birds. So the correct answer would be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, only one trait will be expressed. So the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (phenotype RRBB)\nWait, no\u2014I think the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their order. So for pigment red, C is dominant over c, so if C is present, the bird is red. Similarly, for brown, B is dominant over b, so if B is present, the bird is brown. Thus, the phenotypes are combinations where each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown: C and B both present\n- Red and Checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain and Brown: c and B present\n- Plain and Checkered: c and B absent\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigmented Red and Brown (C and B):\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have this phenotype?\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because if both genes are dominant, then the bird will display both traits. But if either gene is recessive, only one trait is displayed. However, in this case, since both parents are homozygous for both traits (one is CC BB, the other is cc bb), the F1 generation will always be CcBb, which means both C and B are present. Thus, every F1 bird will have both traits, making the phenotype \"Red and Brown\" for all F1 birds. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because typically, in dihybrid crosses, you get different phenotypes depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are such that all F1 individuals carry the dominant alleles for both genes, so all F1 birds will display both traits. Therefore, the F1 population will be 100% \"Red and Brown.\" Then, when F1 (all Red and Brown) selfs, what happens? Since all F1 birds are R and B, they'll produce gametes that are CR and CB (or whatever the notation is). Wait, but in reality, the alleles are C and B, so the gametes would be CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb. So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. But since all F1s are CcBb, they'll produce CB and cb equally. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have four possible combinations of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the possible F2 genotypes are CC (CB+CB), Cc (CB+cb), cc (cb+cb), and bb (cb+cb). Now, determining the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nThus, all four phenotypes occur in equal numbers (25% each). Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equivalently, each phenotype occurs equally often. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly, but option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2,\" which is a 3:1:1:1 ratio. Option H mentions 5,3,2,6, which isn't matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which would be a 3:1:3:1 ratio. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is 1:3:9:3, suggesting a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but our calculation shows equal distribution across all four phenotypes. So none of the options perfectly match my conclusion. However, looking at the options, option G has four phenotypes with equal counts, but in the given options, the counts don't add up to 16. Wait, 12 + 2 + 2 + 2 equals 18, which is too high. Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the genetic model. Maybe the traits are additive or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the number of birds rather than the percentage. In that case, each bird could have one of four phenotypes, so 16 birds would have 4 each, giving a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total number of offspring. If the F2 generation has 16 birds (assuming each parent contributes 8), but that's speculative. Wait, let me count the possible F2 genotypes. From earlier, the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But the actual phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigmented red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain, Plain \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs in a 25% ratio among the F2 population. So if the F2 population has 16 birds, then 4 would have each phenotype, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But the options don't include this. Wait, but option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\"\u2014which sums to 18, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014summing to 12, which also doesn't fit. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014summing to 16. That fits perfectly. So in E, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16 birds. So the correct answer would be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "rollout": " But since all parents are either homozygous dominant (for pigment) or homozygous recessive (for pigment), the F2 could potentially have different combinations. Wait, let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles at both loci. The possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red (dominant), brown (dominant) \u2192 phenotype: Pigment red and brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Pigment red, checkered (since B is recessive) \u2192 phenotype: Pigment red and checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B: Plain, brown \u2192 Pigment plain, brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain, checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (C_) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (B_) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1.

Adding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\n- 9: Pigment red and brown\n- 3: Pigment red and checkered\n- 3: Plain red and brown\n- 1: Plain red and checkered\n\nWait, but in terms of the options, the options describe the number of each type of bird. Let me clarify:\n\nThe options are listing the counts of each phenotype across the F2 generation. So, for example, option A states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But according to our calculation, the numbers should add up to 16 birds. Wait, but the options don't specify the total number. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for the correct count without worrying about the total being 16, as the options may vary in phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at Option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match exactly what I derived. Maybe I need to double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic ratios. Let me list the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red and brown \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain red and checkered \u2192 1/16\n\nSo, if we consider the F2 generation, each bird has a chance to fall into one of these four categories. The actual number of each phenotype would depend on the number of offspring produced. However, since the question asks for the ratio, not the exact number, the answer should reflect the relative proportions. So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1, but let's see:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems to correspond to the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which isn't correct because 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the total.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused between the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain.\" Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Checkered: Plain red (cc) + checkered (bb) \u2192 phenotype: Plain red and checkered\n- Plain: Checkered red (cc) + plain (bb) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, the terminology might be confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the context of the problem, the checkered color refers to the recessive allele at the B locus (b), while the plain refers to the recessive at the C locus (c). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s opposite. Because the checkered color is caused by the recessive allele at the B locus (b), leading to a blend of brown and black (or brown and plain?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me instead focus on the given options. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. According to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean:\n\n- Plain red and checkered: 9\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3\n- Pigment red and brown: 9\n- Plain red and brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 16. So, the order in Option D is:\n\nCheckered red 1 \u2192 Wait, that doesn\u2019t fit because 9 is larger than 1. Similarly, Checkered brown is 3, which fits with the third category (3). Plain red 9, which fits the fourth category (9). Plain brown 3, which fits the second category (3). So Option D seems to follow the correct ratio, despite the numbering. However, Option D lists the numbers as Checkered red 1, which doesn\u2019t align with 9. Maybe I messed up the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered color refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the B locus, making the bird appear a mix of brown and black, hence \"checkered.\" While plain refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the C locus, making the bird appear a mix of red and black, hence \"plain.\" Wait, but in reality, the colors are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles, not the recessive ones. So, the term \"checkered\" might refer to the blending of two colors due to the recessive alleles at one locus.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 3 parts\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain red and brown \u2192 3 parts\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain red and checkered \u2192 1 part\n\nSo the order in the options should be:\n\nPlain red and checkered \u2192 1 part\n\nPigment red and checkered \u2192 3 parts\n\nPigment red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n\nPlain red and brown \u2192 3 parts\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches precisely the four parts: 1, 3, 9, 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since all parents are either homozygous dominant (for pigment) or homozygous recessive (for pigment), the F2 could potentially have different combinations. Wait, let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of alleles at both loci. The possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red (dominant), brown (dominant) \u2192 phenotype: Pigment red and brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Pigment red, checkered (since B is recessive) \u2192 phenotype: Pigment red and checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B: Plain, brown \u2192 Pigment plain, brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain, checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each class can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (C_) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (B_) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. C_ and B_: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. C_ and b_: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. c_ and B_: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. c_ and b_: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four classes above. Adding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to:\n\n- 9: Pigment red and brown\n- 3: Pigment red and checkered\n- 3: Plain red and brown\n- 1: Plain red and checkered\n\nWait, but in terms of the options, the options describe the number of each type of bird. Let me clarify:\n\nThe options are listing the counts of each phenotype across the F2 generation. So, for example, option A states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But according to our calculation, the numbers should add up to 16 birds. Wait, but the options don't specify the total number. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for the correct count without worrying about the total being 16, as the options may vary in phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at Option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match exactly what I derived. Maybe I need to double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic ratios. Let me list the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red and brown \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain red and checkered \u2192 1/16\n\nSo, if we consider the F2 generation, each bird has a chance to fall into one of these four categories. The actual number of each phenotype would depend on the number of offspring produced. However, since the question asks for the ratio, not the exact number, the answer should reflect the relative proportions. So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1, but let's see:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems to correspond to the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which isn't correct because 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the total.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused between the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain.\" Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Checkered: Plain red (cc) + checkered (bb) \u2192 phenotype: Plain red and checkered\n- Plain: Checkered red (cc) + plain (bb) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, the terminology might be confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the context of the problem, the checkered color refers to the recessive allele at the B locus (b), while the plain refers to the recessive at the C locus (c). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s opposite. Because the checkered color is caused by the recessive allele at the B locus (b), leading to a blend of brown and black (or brown and plain?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me instead focus on the given options. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. According to my earlier calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean:\n\n- Plain red and checkered: 9\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3\n- Pigment red and brown: 9\n- Plain red and brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 16. So, the order in Option D is:\n\nCheckered red 1 \u2192 Wait, that doesn\u2019t fit because 9 is larger than 1. Similarly, Checkered brown is 3, which fits with the third category (3). Plain red 9, which fits the fourth category (9). Plain brown 3, which fits the second category (3). So Option D seems to follow the correct ratio, despite the numbering. However, Option D lists the numbers as Checkered red 1, which doesn\u2019t align with 9. Maybe I messed up the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered color refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the B locus, making the bird appear a mix of brown and black, hence \"checkered.\" While plain refers to the presence of the recessive allele at the C locus, making the bird appear a mix of red and black, hence \"plain.\" Wait, but in reality, the colors are determined by the presence of the dominant alleles, not the recessive ones. So, the term \"checkered\" might refer to the blending of two colors due to the recessive alleles at one locus.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 3 parts\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain red and brown \u2192 3 parts\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain red and checkered \u2192 1 part\n\nSo the order in the options should be:\n\nPlain red and checkered \u2192 1 part\n\nPigment red and checkered \u2192 3 parts\n\nPigment red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n\nPlain red and brown \u2192 3 parts\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches precisely the four parts: 1, 3, 9, 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, it won't.",

C recessive, B recessive: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be right because if P(B)=0, then Phenotype 2 and Phenotype 3 are impossible, and Phenotype 4 is also impossible. That suggests that all birds in this scenario would exhibit both traits, i.e., have both Pigment red and Body brown. But according to the parent genotypes, the C and B loci are completely dominant and recessive, respectively. So all offspring would have Pigment red (since C is always present) and Body brown (since B is always present). Therefore, all four phenotypes would not occur; instead, only one phenotype would exist: Pigment red and Brown. But that contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first parent is CC BB, which means both alleles are dominant for pigment (C) and both are dominant for body (B). So any offspring from crossing CC BB with cc bb would inherit C from the first parent and c from the second, leading to Cc in the pigment gene, and B from the first and b from the second, leading to Bb in the body gene. Wait, now I see a confusion in my previous analysis. The initial assumption was that both parents are homozygous for each gene, but perhaps I misapplied it. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous for pigment (C) and homozgygous for body (B).\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous for pigment (c) and homozgygous for body (b).\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. For the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\nSo F1 will be Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the body gene (B/b):\n\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\nSo F1 will be Bb.\n\nThus, each F1 bird has the genotype CcBb, meaning they have one C and one c for pigment, and one B and one b for body.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each in a 25% ratio. Wait, no, each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Since Parent 1 (Cc) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (Bb) can produce CB and cb gametes. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Let me correct this. \n\nEach parent's gametes are based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (Cc) will produce gametes CB (if C comes from the mother and B from the father) and CB (if c comes from the mother and B from the father). Wait, no, actually, each parent produces gametes that are a combination of their two alleles. For Parent 1 (Cc), the gametes are CB because it can only produce C and c alleles. Similarly, Parent 2 (Bb) can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB (25%), cb (25%), cB (25%), and bc (25%). Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and bc, each in 25% ratio. \n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 (Cc) can only contribute C or c. Parent 2 (Bb) can only contribute B or b. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes as follows: \n- From Parent 1: C or c\n- From Parent 2: B or b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, cB, CB, and bc (but wait, B and b are separate, so the actual gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and bc, each with a 25% chance). So the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc, each at 25%.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the combination of the gametes:\n\n- CB x CB = CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb = Cc Bb (25%)\n- CB x cB = Cc BB (25%)\n- CB x bc = Cc Bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly, cb x CB = Cc Bb (25%)\ncb x cb = cc bb (25%)\ncb x cB = cc BB (25%)\ncb x bc = cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, this seems too complex. Instead, since each gamete has an equal chance, the F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBecause each parent contributes gametes randomly, the combinations are as follows:\n\n- All combinations where both parents contribute C and B will lead to CC BB.\n- Half the cases where one parent contributes C and the other contributes c, while the other parent contributes B and b will lead to Cc Bb.\n- The same as above, half the cases will lead to cc bb.\n\nWait, but no\u2014the F2 will have 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, and 25% cc bb. Because:\n\n- From the four possible gamete combinations, each leads to specific F2 genotypes. But actually, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is to consider the possible combinations of dominant and recessive traits. \n\nAlternatively, since each gene is segregating independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. \n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 dominates.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = P(C) * P(not B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Can't happen.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Can't happen.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain red and checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = P(c) * P(not B) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Also can't happen.\n\nWait, this can't be right because all possible phenotypes seem to require both dominant traits. This suggests that all F2 individuals will display both Pigment red and Brown, meaning all phenotypes except those without Pigment red or without Brown would be present, but given the dominance, it's likely that all F2 will have both traits. However, this contradicts the expectation because typically, independent assortment would result in a mix of phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me reconsider. \n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. To get Pigment red (C is dominant), the bird must have at least one C. To get Brown (B is dominant), the bird must have at least one B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain red and Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain red and Checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B both present \u2192 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered)\n- Phenotype 3: c present, B present \u2192 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown)\n- Phenotype 4: c present, B absent \u2192 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nThis suggests that Phenotype 2 and Phenotype 4 are impossible because there's no possibility of c or B being absent simultaneously. But that can't be true because the parents are such that one is C and c, and the other is B and b. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the gametes combine. Let me think differently. \n\nEach bird in F2 has two copies of the pigment gene and two copies of the body gene. So for the pigment gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, or cc. Same for the body gene: BB, Bb, or bb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nSimilarly for the body gene:\n\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these, resulting in four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (CC BB)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (CC Bb)\n3. Plain red and Brown (cc BB)\n4. Plain red and Checkered (cc Bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant.\n\nSince the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 50% Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, but this can't be because Phenotype 3 is only when both genes are recessive. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1, corresponding to Phenotype 1:2:1, but let's verify this.\n\nAlternatively, considering the independent assortment, each gene segregates independently, so the probabilities multiply:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (CC BB): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype 2 (CC Bb): (1/4) * (2/4) = 2/16\n- Phenotype 3 (cc BB): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype 4 (cc Bb): (1/4) * (2/4) = 2/16\n\nWait, but this adds up to (1+2+1+2)/16 = 6/16, which is 3/8, but the sum should be 1. So clearly, I'm making a mistake in assigning probabilities. Let me correct this by recognizing that each gamete has an equal chance of being C/B or c/b for each gene, and the combination of two genes is independent.\n\nSo for the pigment gene (C/c):\n- Probability of C = 1/2\n- Probability of c = 1/2\n\nFor the body gene (B/b):\n- Probability of B = 1/2\n- Probability of b = 1/2\n\nThe phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 2 (C and b): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 3 (c and B): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 4 (c and b): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but this would imply all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't correct because the parents are homozygous. Let me re-express this correctly. Each F2 bird will have two copies of each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C/c): \n  - 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For body (B/b):\n  - 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the phenotypic ratios can be found by looking at the combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n5. cc BB \u2192 Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 5\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 6\n\nBut wait, this approach counts all possible combinations, but in reality, the phenotypes group based on dominant traits. So the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Pigment red and/or Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and/or Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red and/or Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red and/or Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nHowever, considering the dominance hierarchy, the phenotypes can be grouped into four categories:\n\n1. Pigment red (dominant C) and Brown (dominant B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (not B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red (not C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red (not C) and Checkered (not B) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by considering the combinations of dominant and recessive traits:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B both present \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: c present, B present \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: c present, B absent \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding these up: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning all four phenotypes are equally likely.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive because typically, independent assortment would result in a 9:3:3:1 ratio for two genes, but here each gene is segregating independently, leading to equal distribution. However, in our case, both genes are segregating independently, so each combination of dominant and recessive traits is equally likely.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match 1:1:1:1. Let me review them:\n\nOption A: 6, checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8, checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9, checkered red 3, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 4^2, but our phenotypic ratio is 4 parts, so not matching.\n\nOption D: 7, checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: 3, checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Let me re-examine the parent genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nCrossing these, F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Phenotype 1)\n- 25% CC Bb (Phenotype 2)\n- 25% Cc BB (Phenotype 3)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Phenotype 4)\n- 25% cc BB (Phenotype 5)\n- 25% cc Bb (Phenotype 6)\n\nBut earlier, I thought that Phenotypes 2 and 4 were impossible, but that's incorrect because the F2 can have both dominant and recessive alleles for both genes. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, Phenotypes 2 and 4 don't exist because they require neither dominant nor recessive traits, but rather both. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype 2 requires C and not B, and Phenotype 4 requires c and not B. These",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, it won't. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nFirst, determine the probability for each gene. For gene C (pigment):\n\nParent is CC BB \u2192 All C alleles are dominant. So any gamete will carry C, so P(C) = 1, P(c) = 0.\n\nFor gene B (body color):\n\nParent is cc bb \u2192 All b alleles are recessive. So any gamete will carry b, so P(B) = 0, P(b) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Both C and B: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown)\n4. C recessive, B recessive: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nWait, that can't be right because if P(B)=0, then Phenotype 2 and Phenotype 3 are impossible, and Phenotype 4 is also impossible. That suggests that all birds in this scenario would exhibit both traits, i.e., have both Pigment red and Body brown. But according to the parent genotypes, the C and B loci are completely dominant and recessive, respectively. So all offspring would have Pigment red (since C is always present) and Body brown (since B is always present). Therefore, all four phenotypes would not occur; instead, only one phenotype would exist: Pigment red and Brown. But that contradicts the idea of different phenotypes. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first parent is CC BB, which means both alleles are dominant for pigment (C) and both are dominant for body (B). So any offspring from crossing CC BB with cc bb would inherit C from the first parent and c from the second, leading to Cc in the pigment gene, and B from the first and b from the second, leading to Bb in the body gene. Wait, now I see a confusion in my previous analysis. The initial assumption was that both parents are homozygous for each gene, but perhaps I misapplied it. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous for pigment (C) and homozgygous for body (B).\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous for pigment (c) and homozgygous for body (b).\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. For the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\nSo F1 will be Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the body gene (B/b):\n\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\nSo F1 will be Bb.\n\nThus, each F1 bird has the genotype CcBb, meaning they have one C and one c for pigment, and one B and one b for body.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each in a 25% ratio. Wait, no, each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Since Parent 1 (Cc) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (Bb) can produce CB and cb gametes. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Let me correct this. \n\nEach parent's gametes are based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (Cc) will produce gametes CB (if C comes from the mother and B from the father) and CB (if c comes from the mother and B from the father). Wait, no, actually, each parent produces gametes that are a combination of their two alleles. For Parent 1 (Cc), the gametes are CB because it can only produce C and c alleles. Similarly, Parent 2 (Bb) can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB (25%), cb (25%), cB (25%), and bc (25%). Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and bc, each in 25% ratio. \n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. Parent 1 (Cc) can only contribute C or c. Parent 2 (Bb) can only contribute B or b. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes as follows: \n- From Parent 1: C or c\n- From Parent 2: B or b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, cB, CB, and bc (but wait, B and b are separate, so the actual gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and bc, each with a 25% chance). So the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc, each at 25%.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the combination of the gametes:\n\n- CB x CB = CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb = Cc Bb (25%)\n- CB x cB = Cc BB (25%)\n- CB x bc = Cc Bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly, cb x CB = Cc Bb (25%)\ncb x cb = cc bb (25%)\ncb x cB = cc BB (25%)\ncb x bc = cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, this seems too complex. Instead, since each gamete has an equal chance, the F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBecause each parent contributes gametes randomly, the combinations are as follows:\n\n- All combinations where both parents contribute C and B will lead to CC BB.\n- Half the cases where one parent contributes C and the other contributes c, while the other parent contributes B and b will lead to Cc Bb.\n- The same as above, half the cases will lead to cc bb.\n\nWait, but no\u2014the F2 will have 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, and 25% cc bb. Because:\n\n- From the four possible gamete combinations, each leads to specific F2 genotypes. But actually, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is to consider the possible combinations of dominant and recessive traits. \n\nAlternatively, since each gene is segregating independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait. \n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 dominates.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = P(C) * P(not B) = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Can't happen.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Can't happen.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain red and checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\nProbability = P(c) * P(not B) = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Also can't happen.\n\nWait, this can't be right because all possible phenotypes seem to require both dominant traits. This suggests that all F2 individuals will display both Pigment red and Brown, meaning all phenotypes except those without Pigment red or without Brown would be present, but given the dominance, it's likely that all F2 will have both traits. However, this contradicts the expectation because typically, independent assortment would result in a mix of phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me reconsider. \n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. To get Pigment red (C is dominant), the bird must have at least one C. To get Brown (B is dominant), the bird must have at least one B. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain red and Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain red and Checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B both present \u2192 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered)\n- Phenotype 3: c present, B present \u2192 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown)\n- Phenotype 4: c present, B absent \u2192 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered)\n\nThis suggests that Phenotype 2 and Phenotype 4 are impossible because there's no possibility of c or B being absent simultaneously. But that can't be true because the parents are such that one is C and c, and the other is B and b. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the gametes combine. Let me think differently. \n\nEach bird in F2 has two copies of the pigment gene and two copies of the body gene. So for the pigment gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, or cc. Same for the body gene: BB, Bb, or bb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nSimilarly for the body gene:\n\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these, resulting in four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (CC BB)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (CC Bb)\n3. Plain red and Brown (cc BB)\n4. Plain red and Checkered (cc Bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant.\n\nSince the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 50% Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, but this can't be because Phenotype 3 is only when both genes are recessive. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1, corresponding to Phenotype 1:2:1, but let's verify this.\n\nAlternatively, considering the independent assortment, each gene segregates independently, so the probabilities multiply:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (CC BB): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype 2 (CC Bb): (1/4) * (2/4) = 2/16\n- Phenotype 3 (cc BB): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- Phenotype 4 (cc Bb): (1/4) * (2/4) = 2/16\n\nWait, but this adds up to (1+2+1+2)/16 = 6/16, which is 3/8, but the sum should be 1. So clearly, I'm making a mistake in assigning probabilities. Let me correct this by recognizing that each gamete has an equal chance of being C/B or c/b for each gene, and the combination of two genes is independent.\n\nSo for the pigment gene (C/c):\n- Probability of C = 1/2\n- Probability of c = 1/2\n\nFor the body gene (B/b):\n- Probability of B = 1/2\n- Probability of b = 1/2\n\nThe phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 2 (C and b): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 3 (c and B): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 4 (c and b): (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but this would imply all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't correct because the parents are homozygous. Let me re-express this correctly. Each F2 bird will have two copies of each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C/c): \n  - 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For body (B/b):\n  - 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the phenotypic ratios can be found by looking at the combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n5. cc BB \u2192 Plain red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 5\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 6\n\nBut wait, this approach counts all possible combinations, but in reality, the phenotypes group based on dominant traits. So the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Pigment red and/or Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and/or Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red and/or Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red and/or Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nHowever, considering the dominance hierarchy, the phenotypes can be grouped into four categories:\n\n1. Pigment red (dominant C) and Brown (dominant B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (not B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red (not C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red (not C) and Checkered (not B) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by considering the combinations of dominant and recessive traits:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B both present \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: c present, B present \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: c present, B absent \u2192 (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding these up: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning all four phenotypes are equally likely.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive because typically, independent assortment would result in a 9:3:3:1 ratio for two genes, but here each gene is segregating independently, leading to equal distribution. However, in our case, both genes are segregating independently, so each combination of dominant and recessive traits is equally likely.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. Looking back at the options:\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match 1:1:1:1. Let me review them:\n\nOption A: 6, checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8, checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9, checkered red 3, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 4^2, but our phenotypic ratio is 4 parts, so not matching.\n\nOption D: 7, checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't add up.\n\nOption E: 3, checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents. Let me re-examine the parent genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nCrossing these, F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Phenotype 1)\n- 25% CC Bb (Phenotype 2)\n- 25% Cc BB (Phenotype 3)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Phenotype 4)\n- 25% cc BB (Phenotype 5)\n- 25% cc Bb (Phenotype 6)\n\nBut earlier, I thought that Phenotypes 2 and 4 were impossible, but that's incorrect because the F2 can have both dominant and recessive alleles for both genes. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, Phenotypes 2 and 4 don't exist because they require neither dominant nor recessive traits, but rather both. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype 2 requires C and not B, and Phenotype 4 requires c and not B. These",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, it'll have the other traits.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, it'll have the other traits. So, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by how many birds have each combination. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for each gene. For the C gene:\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the C locus and B locus separately.\n\nThe bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit that trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C/B)\n\nProbability: P(C is dominant) * P(B is dominant) = 1 * 1 = 1, but this isn't accurate because it's 100% certain. Instead, it's better to think in terms of the possible genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then count them.\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\nC: CC, Cc, cc\nB: BB, Bb, bb\n\nTotal combinations: 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9 possible genotypes.\n\nEach genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain\n\nWait, but that seems off because each bird can have two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the correct mapping should consider that each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many genotypes lead to each phenotype.\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: This occurs when C is dominant (any C) AND B is dominant (any B). Looking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- CC BB is Pigment red, Brown\n- Similarly, CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- So, among the nine genotypes, how many fall into Pigment red and Brown?\n\nLooking back:\n\nGenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\nGenotype 2: CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\nGenotype 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 4: Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\nGenotype 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\nGenotype 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\nGenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, a bird will have Pigment red and Brown if it has at least one dominant C and one dominant B. Pigment red and Checkered if it has C dominant but B recessive. Plain and Brown if it has c and B dominant. Plain and Checkered if it has c and B recessive.\n\nTherefore, for Pigment red and Brown, the bird must have at least one C (so not cc) and at least one B (so not bb). How many genotypes satisfy this?\n\nLooking at the 9 possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- CC bb \u2192 No (Plain, Brown)\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- cc BB \u2192 No (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb \u2192 No (Plain, Checkered)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (Plain, Plain)\n\nSo, how many have both C and B dominant? Let's see:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\nThat's four out of nine.\n\nWait, but wait, CC BB is Pigment red and Brown.\n\nCC Bb is Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nCc BB is Pigment red and Brown.\n\nCc Bb is Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nSo, four cases where Pigment red and Brown occur.\n\nSimilarly, for Pigment red and Checkered, it's when C is dominant and B is recessive.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\nSo, two cases.\n\nFor Plain and Brown: when c is present (at least one c) and B is dominant.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nTwo cases.\n\nFor Plain and Checkered: when c is present and B is recessive.\n\nOnly:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nOne case.\n\nFinally, Plain and Plain: only when both c and b are present.\n\nWhich is:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered? Wait, no. Wait, when both c and b are present, the bird has the recessive alleles for both genes, leading to the most basic phenotype. So:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Both c and b alleles present, so both genes are recessive. Therefore, both traits are expressed as the recessive ones: plain and plain.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: 4/9\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: 2/9\n3. Plain and Brown: 2/9\n4. Plain and Checkered: 1/9\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9/9. So the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1. That makes sense because:\n\n- 4 cases for Pigment red and Brown,\n- 2 for Pigment red and Checkered,\n- 2 for Plain and Brown,\n- 1 for Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. But looking at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let's review the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 4+4+4+4=16\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 12+2+2+0=16\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to directly reflect the 4:2:2:1 ratio. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the counts.\n\nWait, in the Punnett square, when F1 is CcBb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: CB cb (50%)\n- From cb x CB: cb CB (50%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CB cb\n3. cb CB\n4. cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cb CB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Only when both C and B are dominant.\nIn F2, only the genotype CC BB will have both, so 1/4 of the population.\nWait, but in reality, when you look at the phenotypes, each bird can have multiple traits, so the actual count would be based on the number of genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nWait, let's go back to the previous calculation. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for Pigment red and Brown, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B. Among the four F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CB cb \u2192 Yes (as C is dominant, B is recessive)\n- cb CB \u2192 Yes (as B is dominant, C is recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (both c and b present)\n\nSo, three out of four F2 birds have Pigment red and Brown. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, regardless of which gene, then it will have both traits. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CB cb \u2192 Yes\n- cb CB \u2192 Yes (because B is dominant, regardless of C being recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 No\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if a bird has C and B, it should have both traits. Wait, but according to the standard Punnett square, the possible phenotypes after selfing would indeed have 3/4 Pigment red and Brown, because 1/4 would have neither C nor B dominant, i.e., cc bb.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, the phenotype for Pigment red and Brown includes all birds that have at least one C and at least one B. In the F2 cross, the percentage of birds that meet this condition would be 3/4, because only 1/4 have neither (cc bb). Similarly, the percentage for Pigment red and Checkered would be 1/4, as those would have C dominant but B recessive.\n\nSame logic applies to the other phenotypes. So, the correct phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 of the population\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4\n\nWait, but that sums up to 3/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 2.25, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me use a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (RrBb)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (Rrbb)\n3. Plain and Brown (rrBb)\n4. Plain and Checkered (rrbb)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the phenotypes aren't purely additive. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. So, the correct way is to combine the possible genotypes into phenotypes.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for each gene, and based on that, a phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), it contributes pigment red.\n- If B is dominant (B_), it contributes brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive (cc bb), it contributes plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. The F2 population consists of 16 birds (4x4 Punnett square).\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb. The possible genotypes for each gene are C (dominant) or c (recessive) for C, and B (dominant) or b (recessive) for B.\n\nWhen crossed, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of C and B alleles, and their phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). So, any genotype except cc bb.\n\nHow many such genotypes? All except cc bb. There are 16 birds. The number of cc bb is 1 (only one bird has both recessive alleles). So, Pigment red and Brown: 15 birds? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination of both genes, so the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nWait, actually, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes that result in that phenotype. Since each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, the actual count isn't straightforward because the same genotype can lead to multiple phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014for each bird, the phenotype is determined solely by their alleles for both genes. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb will have Pigment red and Brown, while a bird with genotype Ccbb will have Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nThus, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype. Therefore, for Pigment red and Brown: any bird with at least one C and at least one B. That excludes only the cc bb genotype, which is 1 bird. So Pigment red and Brown: 15 birds? That can't be right because the total is 16.\n\nWait, no, because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the count isn't additive. Instead, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to that phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: any bird with at least one C and at least one B. This would exclude the cc bb genotype. So, 15 birds?\nNo, that's incorrect because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the count is based on the number of phenotypic categories. For example, 1/4 of the birds have Pigment red and Brown, 1/4 Pigment red and Checkered, 1/4 Plain and Brown, and 1/4 Plain and Checkered. But that sums to less than 1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The correct way is to realize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the Punnett square for two independent genes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since each bird has two traits, the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, as previously thought. But looking at the options, the closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Alternatively, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The number of each phenotype in the F2 population would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 of the birds (excluding cc bb). So 12 birds.\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4 (including cc bb). So 4 birds.\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4. So 4 birds.\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4. So 4 birds.\n\nWait, but that sums to 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24, which exceeds 16, so that's wrong. I must have miscalculated.\n\nAnother approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown: this requires at least one C and at least one B. In the F2 population, the number of birds with at least one C and at least one B is 3/4 of 16, which is 12.\n\nPigment red and Checkered: requires C dominant and B recessive. This is 1/4 of 16, which is 4 birds.\n\nPlain and Brown: requires c dominant and B dominant. This is also 1/4 of 16, 4 birds.\n\nPlain and Checkered: requires c dominant and b dominant. This is also 1/4 of 16, 4 birds.\n\nWait, that still sums to 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct ratios are:\n\nPigment red and Brown: 9/16\nPigment red and Checkered: 3/16\nPlain and Brown: 3/16\nPlain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\n- 9: 9\n- 3: 3\n- 3: 3\n-",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, it'll have the other traits. So, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by how many birds have each combination. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for each gene. For the C gene:\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the C locus and B locus separately.\n\nThe bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit that trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C/B)\n\nProbability: P(C is dominant) * P(B is dominant) = 1 * 1 = 1, but this isn't accurate because it's 100% certain. Instead, it's better to think in terms of the possible genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then count them.\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\nC: CC, Cc, cc\nB: BB, Bb, bb\n\nTotal combinations: 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9 possible genotypes.\n\nEach genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain\n\nWait, but that seems off because each bird can have two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the correct mapping should consider that each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many genotypes lead to each phenotype.\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: This occurs when C is dominant (any C) AND B is dominant (any B). Looking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- CC BB is Pigment red, Brown\n- Similarly, CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- So, among the nine genotypes, how many fall into Pigment red and Brown?\n\nLooking back:\n\nGenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\nGenotype 2: CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\nGenotype 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 4: Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\nGenotype 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\nGenotype 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\nGenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\nGenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, a bird will have Pigment red and Brown if it has at least one dominant C and one dominant B. Pigment red and Checkered if it has C dominant but B recessive. Plain and Brown if it has c and B dominant. Plain and Checkered if it has c and B recessive.\n\nTherefore, for Pigment red and Brown, the bird must have at least one C (so not cc) and at least one B (so not bb). How many genotypes satisfy this?\n\nLooking at the 9 possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- CC bb \u2192 No (Plain, Brown)\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes (Red, Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes (Red, Checkered)\n- cc BB \u2192 No (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb \u2192 No (Plain, Checkered)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (Plain, Plain)\n\nSo, how many have both C and B dominant? Let's see:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\nThat's four out of nine.\n\nWait, but wait, CC BB is Pigment red and Brown.\n\nCC Bb is Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nCc BB is Pigment red and Brown.\n\nCc Bb is Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nSo, four cases where Pigment red and Brown occur.\n\nSimilarly, for Pigment red and Checkered, it's when C is dominant and B is recessive.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\nSo, two cases.\n\nFor Plain and Brown: when c is present (at least one c) and B is dominant.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nTwo cases.\n\nFor Plain and Checkered: when c is present and B is recessive.\n\nOnly:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nOne case.\n\nFinally, Plain and Plain: only when both c and b are present.\n\nWhich is:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered? Wait, no. Wait, when both c and b are present, the bird has the recessive alleles for both genes, leading to the most basic phenotype. So:\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Both c and b alleles present, so both genes are recessive. Therefore, both traits are expressed as the recessive ones: plain and plain.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: 4/9\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: 2/9\n3. Plain and Brown: 2/9\n4. Plain and Checkered: 1/9\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9/9. So the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:2:1. That makes sense because:\n\n- 4 cases for Pigment red and Brown,\n- 2 for Pigment red and Checkered,\n- 2 for Plain and Brown,\n- 1 for Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1. But looking at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let's review the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 9+3+3+1=16\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1+3+9+3=16\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 4+4+4+4=16\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 12+2+2+0=16\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to directly reflect the 4:2:2:1 ratio. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the counts.\n\nWait, in the Punnett square, when F1 is CcBb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: CB cb (50%)\n- From cb x CB: cb CB (50%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CB cb\n3. cb CB\n4. cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cb CB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Only when both C and B are dominant.\nIn F2, only the genotype CC BB will have both, so 1/4 of the population.\nWait, but in reality, when you look at the phenotypes, each bird can have multiple traits, so the actual count would be based on the number of genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nWait, let's go back to the previous calculation. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for Pigment red and Brown, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B. Among the four F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CB cb \u2192 Yes (as C is dominant, B is recessive)\n- cb CB \u2192 Yes (as B is dominant, C is recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (both c and b present)\n\nSo, three out of four F2 birds have Pigment red and Brown. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, regardless of which gene, then it will have both traits. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- CB cb \u2192 Yes\n- cb CB \u2192 Yes (because B is dominant, regardless of C being recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 No\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if a bird has C and B, it should have both traits. Wait, but according to the standard Punnett square, the possible phenotypes after selfing would indeed have 3/4 Pigment red and Brown, because 1/4 would have neither C nor B dominant, i.e., cc bb.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, the phenotype for Pigment red and Brown includes all birds that have at least one C and at least one B. In the F2 cross, the percentage of birds that meet this condition would be 3/4, because only 1/4 have neither (cc bb). Similarly, the percentage for Pigment red and Checkered would be 1/4, as those would have C dominant but B recessive.\n\nSame logic applies to the other phenotypes. So, the correct phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 of the population\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4\n\nWait, but that sums up to 3/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 2.25, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me use a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (RrBb)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (Rrbb)\n3. Plain and Brown (rrBb)\n4. Plain and Checkered (rrbb)\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the phenotypes aren't purely additive. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. So, the correct way is to combine the possible genotypes into phenotypes.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for each gene, and based on that, a phenotype.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), it contributes pigment red.\n- If B is dominant (B_), it contributes brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive (cc bb), it contributes plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. The F2 population consists of 16 birds (4x4 Punnett square).\n\nEach bird's genotype is determined by the F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb. The possible genotypes for each gene are C (dominant) or c (recessive) for C, and B (dominant) or b (recessive) for B.\n\nWhen crossed, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of C and B alleles, and their phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). So, any genotype except cc bb.\n\nHow many such genotypes? All except cc bb. There are 16 birds. The number of cc bb is 1 (only one bird has both recessive alleles). So, Pigment red and Brown: 15 birds? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination of both genes, so the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nWait, actually, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes that result in that phenotype. Since each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, the actual count isn't straightforward because the same genotype can lead to multiple phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014for each bird, the phenotype is determined solely by their alleles for both genes. So, for example, a bird with genotype CcBb will have Pigment red and Brown, while a bird with genotype Ccbb will have Pigment red and Checkered.\n\nThus, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype. Therefore, for Pigment red and Brown: any bird with at least one C and at least one B. That excludes only the cc bb genotype, which is 1 bird. So Pigment red and Brown: 15 birds? That can't be right because the total is 16.\n\nWait, no, because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the count isn't additive. Instead, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of genotypes leading to that phenotype. So:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: any bird with at least one C and at least one B. This would exclude the cc bb genotype. So, 15 birds?\nNo, that's incorrect because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the count is based on the number of phenotypic categories. For example, 1/4 of the birds have Pigment red and Brown, 1/4 Pigment red and Checkered, 1/4 Plain and Brown, and 1/4 Plain and Checkered. But that sums to less than 1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The correct way is to realize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypic ratios can be determined by counting the number of genotypes that lead to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the Punnett square for two independent genes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since each bird has two traits, the ratio becomes 4:2:2:1, as previously thought. But looking at the options, the closest is option G: 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Alternatively, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The number of each phenotype in the F2 population would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 3/4 of the birds (excluding cc bb). So 12 birds.\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4 (including cc bb). So 4 birds.\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4. So 4 birds.\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4. So 4 birds.\n\nWait, but that sums to 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24, which exceeds 16, so that's wrong. I must have miscalculated.\n\nAnother approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown: this requires at least one C and at least one B. In the F2 population, the number of birds with at least one C and at least one B is 3/4 of 16, which is 12.\n\nPigment red and Checkered: requires C dominant and B recessive. This is 1/4 of 16, which is 4 birds.\n\nPlain and Brown: requires c dominant and B dominant. This is also 1/4 of 16, 4 birds.\n\nPlain and Checkered: requires c dominant and b dominant. This is also 1/4 of 16, 4 birds.\n\nWait, that still sums to 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct ratios are:\n\nPigment red and Brown: 9/16\nPigment red and Checkered: 3/16\nPlain and Brown: 3/16\nPlain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\n- 9: 9\n- 3: 3\n- 3: 3\n-",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But if either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait.",
    "rollout": " But if either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has a dominant C and a dominant B, it'll have both traits. If a bird has a recessive c and a dominant B, it'll have brown body but plain color. Similarly, a bird with C and recessive B will have red color but checkered body. A bird with recessive c and recessive b will have neither, i.e., plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 dominant\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 recessive\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 dominant\n- Body checkered (b) \u2192 recessive\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will exhibit both traits. If it lacks a dominant allele for one gene, it won't display that trait. So, the possible phenotypes are combinations where each trait is present only if at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (gene C):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since both parents are C)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 0 (both parents are C)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the parents are CC and cc. Wait, no\u2014wait, the first parent is CC BB, which for the C locus is C and C. The second parent is cc bb, which for the C locus is c and c. So, the possible gametes for the C locus are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CC, then it can only give C gametes. Wait, hold on\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 for the C locus, it's C; for the B locus, it's B.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 for the C locus, it's c; for the B locus, it's b.\n\nSo, the F1 generated by crossing them would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Therefore, the F1 will have:\n\n- For C locus: C and c (so 50% C, 50% c)\n- For B locus: B and b (so 50% B, 50% b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for each gene, the probability is 0.5 for each allele.\n\nNow, let's consider the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) will self to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% chance. So, the F2 will have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But due to independence, the actual gametes produced are:\n\n- From CB gametes: 25% of F2 individuals (since CB x CB = CC for the C locus and BB for the B locus)\n- From cb gametes: 25% of F2 individuals (cb x cb = cc for the C locus and bb for the B locus)\n- Additionally, the other gametes (cB) come from the cross of CB and cb gametes, resulting in 50% cB and 50% cB.\n\nWait, no. Correction: When F1 (CcBb) crosses, the F2 genotypes are determined by the F1's gametes. So the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each type occurs with a certain frequency. Specifically:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n\nWait, but this isn't accurate. Actually, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each with 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes:\n\n- CB: 50% (from Cc x Cc)\n- cb: 50% (from Cc x Cc)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, except for CC and cc, which have 25% each, and Cc and cb, also 25% each. Wait, no, that's incorrect because the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 population will consist of four types of individuals: CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each with 25% frequency.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Pigment red; C is dominant, so regardless of B, it'll be red. Also, since C is dominant, the bird will have red pigment. Whether it's B or not, it will have red. So, it will have red color. But does it have brown? Only if B is dominant. Since B is recessive, it won't have brown. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, for pigment color (C): presence (red). For body color (B): presence (brown). So, a bird with both C and B alleles (i.e., CC BB) will have both red and brown. A bird with C but not B (e.g., CC bb) will have red color but brown body. A bird with c and B (e.g., cc BB) will have plain color but brown body. A bird with c and not B (e.g., cc bb) will have plain color and plain body. \n\nWait, but according to our previous analysis, the F2 will have four types: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%). Now, let's map each to their phenotype:\n\n- CC: C dominant, so pigment red; B is recessive, so body plain \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red, plain\n- Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body plain \u2192 Same as CC, since C is dominant. Wait, no\u2014wait, Cc is dominant for C, so pigment red. B is recessive, so body plain. So, same as CC. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, no\u2014because in reality, if you have C dominant, you have red pigment regardless of B. But the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, a bird with C (p pigment) and not B (body plain) will have red pigment and plain body. A bird with C and B will have both traits. A bird with c and B will have body brown but plain color. A bird with c and B will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): presence \u2192 dominant\n- Pigment plain (c): absence \u2192 recessive\n- Body brown (B): presence \u2192 dominant\n- Body plain (b): absence \u2192 recessive\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is a combination of these traits. Therefore, the four F2 genotypes translate to:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red,Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain color, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain color, Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype?\n\nFrom the F2 distribution:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (25%): Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 3\n- bb (25%): Phenotype 4\n\nSo, each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. However, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions J and E suggest different ratios. Option J says 2:6:2:6, which adds up to 16, while option E says 3:9:3:1, adding to 16. Wait, but my calculation shows each phenotype is 25%, so 4:4:4:4. But none of the options match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F1 being CcBb is incorrect. Wait, the initial cross is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) crossed with a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 should be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute CB or cb gametes. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield four phenotypes with each having a 25% chance. So, the F2 would indeed have each phenotype at 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Instead, option G says 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Option H says 5:3:2:6, sum 16. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which fits my calculation perfectly. So, the correct answer should be option F, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. But let me confirm how the phenotypes are defined. In the F2, the phenotypes are based on the combination of the two genes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc (no, wait\u2014no, checkered is when c is present for both genes?) Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or not. So, checkered is when c is present for both genes, but wait, no\u2014checkered is when both genes are recessive, so c is present for both. Wait, no\u2014a bird with c in both genes would be checkered. Wait, but in the context of the given problem, the checkered phenotype is caused by the recessive alleles in both genes. So, the checkered phenotype corresponds to cc bb. But in reality, when both genes are recessive, the bird will have both colors and a solid body. But in the problem statement, \"Checkered\" refers specifically to the case where both genes are recessive, leading to the checkered coloration. However, the problem defines \"checkered\" as the recessive phenotype of both genes, which may correspond to cc bb, but in terms of the F2 phenotypes, the checkered phenotype would occur when both c alleles are present for both B and b genes. Wait, but in our previous analysis, the phenotypic classes were based on the presence of dominant alleles. Maybe I've misapplied the terminology. Perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, i.e., when both c alleles are present for both B and b genes, resulting in plain color and solid body. But in reality, the presence of c in both B and b genes leads to both traits being recessive. So, perhaps in the phenotypic classification, the checkered phenotype corresponds to the recessive state, which would be when both B and b are recessive. But I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe problem defines:\n\n- Checkered coloration as recessive alleles (c) in both B and b genes.\n\nWhich would mean that checkered is when both B and b are recessive. But wait, in reality, when both B and b are recessive, the bird will have both traits (red and brown) and a solid body. So, perhaps the term \"checkered\" here refers to the solid body, rather than the color. But in the problem statement, it says \"checkered coloration\", implying that the solid body is considered a separate trait. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, meaning that the bird will have both traits (red and brown) and solid body. This could complicate the phenotypic classification.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer back to the original question. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, including the checkered phenotype. The options provided include various ratios, such as 1:1:1:1, which aligns with the 25% frequency of each phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which corresponds to option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Wait, but option F says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches the 25% frequency of each phenotype. Therefore, option F is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But if either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. Wait, but in reality, if a bird has a dominant C and a dominant B, it'll have both traits. If a bird has a recessive c and a dominant B, it'll have brown body but plain color. Similarly, a bird with C and recessive B will have red color but checkered body. A bird with recessive c and recessive b will have neither, i.e., plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 dominant\n- Pigment plain (c) \u2192 recessive\n- Body brown (B) \u2192 dominant\n- Body checkered (b) \u2192 recessive\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will exhibit both traits. If it lacks a dominant allele for one gene, it won't display that trait. So, the possible phenotypes are combinations where each trait is present only if at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (gene C):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since both parents are C)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 0 (both parents are C)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the parents are CC and cc. Wait, no\u2014wait, the first parent is CC BB, which for the C locus is C and C. The second parent is cc bb, which for the C locus is c and c. So, the possible gametes for the C locus are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CC, then it can only give C gametes. Wait, hold on\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 for the C locus, it's C; for the B locus, it's B.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 for the C locus, it's c; for the B locus, it's b.\n\nSo, the F1 generated by crossing them would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Therefore, the F1 will have:\n\n- For C locus: C and c (so 50% C, 50% c)\n- For B locus: B and b (so 50% B, 50% b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, for each gene, the probability is 0.5 for each allele.\n\nNow, let's consider the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) will self to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at a 50% chance. So, the F2 will have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But due to independence, the actual gametes produced are:\n\n- From CB gametes: 25% of F2 individuals (since CB x CB = CC for the C locus and BB for the B locus)\n- From cb gametes: 25% of F2 individuals (cb x cb = cc for the C locus and bb for the B locus)\n- Additionally, the other gametes (cB) come from the cross of CB and cb gametes, resulting in 50% cB and 50% cB.\n\nWait, no. Correction: When F1 (CcBb) crosses, the F2 genotypes are determined by the F1's gametes. So the F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each type occurs with a certain frequency. Specifically:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n\nWait, but this isn't accurate. Actually, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each with 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes:\n\n- CB: 50% (from Cc x Cc)\n- cb: 50% (from Cc x Cc)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, except for CC and cc, which have 25% each, and Cc and cb, also 25% each. Wait, no, that's incorrect because the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 population will consist of four types of individuals: CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each with 25% frequency.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Pigment red; C is dominant, so regardless of B, it'll be red. Also, since C is dominant, the bird will have red pigment. Whether it's B or not, it will have red. So, it will have red color. But does it have brown? Only if B is dominant. Since B is recessive, it won't have brown. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, for pigment color (C): presence (red). For body color (B): presence (brown). So, a bird with both C and B alleles (i.e., CC BB) will have both red and brown. A bird with C but not B (e.g., CC bb) will have red color but brown body. A bird with c and B (e.g., cc BB) will have plain color but brown body. A bird with c and not B (e.g., cc bb) will have plain color and plain body. \n\nWait, but according to our previous analysis, the F2 will have four types: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%). Now, let's map each to their phenotype:\n\n- CC: C dominant, so pigment red; B is recessive, so body plain \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red, plain\n- Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, body plain \u2192 Same as CC, since C is dominant. Wait, no\u2014wait, Cc is dominant for C, so pigment red. B is recessive, so body plain. So, same as CC. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, no\u2014because in reality, if you have C dominant, you have red pigment regardless of B. But the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, a bird with C (p pigment) and not B (body plain) will have red pigment and plain body. A bird with C and B will have both traits. A bird with c and B will have body brown but plain color. A bird with c and B will have both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): presence \u2192 dominant\n- Pigment plain (c): absence \u2192 recessive\n- Body brown (B): presence \u2192 dominant\n- Body plain (b): absence \u2192 recessive\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is a combination of these traits. Therefore, the four F2 genotypes translate to:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red,Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain color, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain color, Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype?\n\nFrom the F2 distribution:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (25%): Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%): Phenotype 3\n- bb (25%): Phenotype 4\n\nSo, each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, making the phenotypic ratio 1:1:1:1. However, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions J and E suggest different ratios. Option J says 2:6:2:6, which adds up to 16, while option E says 3:9:3:1, adding to 16.

Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield four phenotypes with each having a 25% chance. So, the F2 would indeed have each phenotype at 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.

But in the problem statement, it says \"checkered coloration\", implying that the solid body is considered a separate trait. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, meaning that the bird will have both traits (red and brown) and solid body. This could complicate the phenotypic classification.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer back to the original question. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, including the checkered phenotype. The options provided include various ratios, such as 1:1:1:1, which aligns with the 25% frequency of each phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which corresponds to option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Wait, but option F says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches the 25% frequency of each phenotype. Therefore, option F is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So all phenotypes in this case would be either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered.",
    "rollout": " So all phenotypes in this case would be either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. But given that the parents are homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for another, the F2 would include all four phenotypes. Wait, but according to the options provided, the correct answer seems to involve checking which phenotypes are expressed.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Let's consider the possible gametes from each parent. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes because both alleles are dominant. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb gametes because both alleles are recessive. Therefore, the F1 (which is CcBb) can only receive CB from each parent, making all its gametes CB. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, and it selfs. The gametes it produces would be CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. Because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes from F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB (same as above)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (both c and b)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown (duplicate)\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown (duplicate)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the F2 genotypes after selfing would be as follows:\n\nEach F2 bird can have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdditionally, the other possibility is Cc BB and cc bb, but those combine into the same phenotypes as above because the c in the second position (for pigment) doesn\u2019t affect the overall phenotype. Wait, no\u2014actually, the c affects the pigment color. So:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, Cc BB and cc bb don't change the fact that the bird is Brown regardless of the pigment color.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2. But our calculation shows 25%, 50%, 25% for the phenotypes, which sums to 100%. However, the options don't directly reflect this unless scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are referring to the actual count rather than percentages. Let me recalculate the counts assuming a large number of birds. For example, if we have 16 birds:\n\n- 4 checkered red (25% of 16)\n- 8 checkered brown (50% of 16)\n- 4 plain brown (25% of 16)\n\nBut the options don't align with this. Wait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That adds up to 18, which isn't divisible by 16. Maybe the options are mislabeled, or I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 selfed twice, but the F1 itself is already crossed, so F2 would be the next generation. Wait, the question states \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2, which includes the four phenotypes I outlined earlier. \n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds, which fits. However, my calculation showed 25% checkered red, 50% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. So in a sample of 16 birds, 4 would be checkered red, 8 checkered brown, and 4 plain brown. This doesn't match option D. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question mentions a checkered pattern controlled by the recessive allele c. Wait, hold on! There's confusion here. In the initial description, the recessive allele c controls the plain color, which is checkered. Wait, no: the user wrote:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nWait, wait\u2014that's conflicting. Usually, in genetics, the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, if B is dominant for brown, then b would mask the black color, but here, it's stated that b causes plain color. So perhaps the correct understanding is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered (the recessive allele for the plain color). Wait, no\u2014the original statement was: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThis seems reversed. Normally, the dominant allele masks the recessive one, so if B is dominant for brown, then b would cause the lack of brown (i.e., plain). But here, it's written that b causes plain color, implying that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for something else. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn standard terminology, the dominant allele B would allow the bird to exhibit brown (if B is associated with brown) and the recessive allele b would prevent brown, allowing them to display a different color, say checkered. But according to the user's problem statement, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, b is the dominant allele for brown and recessive for checkered. That can't be right because usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. So perhaps the intended meaning is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, meaning that both B and b are dominant, and the recessive alleles are absent. But that contradicts the usual notation where uppercase letters represent dominant traits and lowercase recessive. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for checkered, making B and b both dominant alleles. But that would mean that the bird is always brown, which contradicts the initial statement saying that brown color is determined by the recessive allele b. Therefore, perhaps the user made a typo, and instead of b being the recessive allele for brown, it's the dominant allele for brown. Let me proceed under the assumption that B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for checkered, meaning that the recessive alleles are not present. So, the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of b results in checkered. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for something else, but it's unclear. To resolve this, I'll assume that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered. Thus, the presence of B allows brown, and the presence of b allows checkered. This way, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b present)\n\nAnd the absence of both (B recessive and b recessive) would be plain. So, now, going back to the F2 generation. The F2 phenotypes would be determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (B and b present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, b absent)\n3. Checkered and Plain (B absent, b present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B absent, b absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown and Checkered\nProbability = P(B) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this would imply certainty, which may not be the case. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then having at least one dominant allele in either gene results in the corresponding trait. So the presence of B means brown, and the presence of b means checkered. So all birds with at least one B (brown) and at least one b (checkered) would be brown and checkered. Conversely, birds without B (pB=0) but with b (pb=1) would be checkered and plain. Similarly, birds without b (pb=0) but with B (pB=1) would be brown and plain. Birds without B and without b would be plain and plain.)\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, which is a double\u6742\u5408\u4f53. Upon selfing, the F2 would have various genotypes, including those where B is present, b is present, both, neither, etc.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, which is the cross of a homozygous CcBB and a homozygous ccbb bird. Wait, no\u2014the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Wait, but the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1. So the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1, not from the parents themselves. So the F2 will be generated by crossing the F1 (CcBb) with itself. \n\nTo create the Punnett square for F2, we list the possible gametes from each parent. From CC BB, the only gamete is CB. From cc bb, the only gamete is cb. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes formed by CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, and cb \u00d7 cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB (same as above)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Same as above\n- cc bb \u2192 Same as above\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 50% (from Cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (from cc bb)\n\nIf we take 16 birds as a sample, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Checkered Brown: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this exact distribution. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total is 16 birds. This seems to suggest that only 1 bird is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. Wait, that doesn't fit our calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the number of individuals showing each phenotype without considering dominance, but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the recessive alleles differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused the roles of B and b. If B were dominant for brown and b dominant for checkered, then the presence of B would lead to brown, and the presence of b would lead to checkered. Without B, you get plain. And with b, you get checkered regardless of B. This would change the possible phenotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem with this corrected interpretation. If B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B (dominant for brown) will have brown color.\n- Any bird with at least one b (dominant for checkered) will have checkered color.\n- Birds without B and without b (homozygous recessive for both traits) will have plain color.\n\nUnder this scenario, the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the presence of B and b in their genotype.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (has B and b)\n2. Brown and Plain (has B, no b)\n3. Checkered and Plain (no B, has b)\n4. Plain and Plain (no B and no b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having B (dominant) is 1 (since any B allele makes them brown). Similarly, the probability of having b (dominant) is 1. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability of having at least one B and at least one b is zero because B and b are both dominant, meaning any bird will have at least one dominant allele for both traits. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then having at least one B will make them brown, and having at least one b will make them checkered. So the only way a bird could have neither is if both are recessive (no B and no b).\n\nBut in reality, since both B and b are dominant, any bird will have at least one dominant allele for both traits, meaning that all birds will have both brown and checkered colors. Therefore, all phenotypes would be brown and checkered. But this contradicts the initial problem statement, which said that checkered is due to the recessive allele c, and brown due to B. So perhaps the user mixed up the alleles.\n\nAssuming the correct interpretation is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then all F2 birds will have both brown and checkered colors, leading to a single phenotype. However, this contradicts the initial problem statement regarding the F2 phenotypes listed in the options. Therefore, I must reconcile this.\n\nPerhaps the user intended that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for the absence of checkered (i.e., b is the recessive allele for checkered). That is, B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for the recessive trait (like having checkered), while the presence of a dominant c allele would result in plain color. But the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So if b is the recessive allele for brown and B is dominant for brown, then the presence of B would result in brown, and the presence of b would result in checkered. \n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, if B is dominant for brown, then b would cause the absence of brown, i.e., plain color. Similarly, if b is dominant for checkered, then B would cause the absence of checkered, i.e., plain color. Wait, this seems contradictory because typically, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user mixed up the roles of B and b. Let me try to clarify once again:\n\n- Gene B: Red (dominant) and Brown (recessive)\n- Gene b: Checkered (dominant) and plain (recessive)\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, brown is expressed only when the B allele is recessive. Similarly, checkered is expressed only when the b allele is recessive. Therefore, the presence of B (dominant) results in brown, and the presence of b (dominant) results in checkered. The absence of both (B recessive and b recessive) results in plain.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Brown and Checkered: Both B and b present\n- Brown and Plain: B present, b absent\n- Checkered and Plain: B absent, b present\n- Plain and Plain: B absent, b absent\n\nNow, with this model, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (B and b present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, b absent)\n3. Checkered and Plain (B absent, b present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B absent, b absent)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Probability of B and b present. Since B is dominant, having at least one B allele results in brown. Similarly, having at least one b allele results in checkered. So the probability of having at least one B and at least one b is calculated as follows:\n\nThe chance of having at least one B is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the chance of having at least one b is 1 - (probability of BB) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSince B and b are independent, the probability of having at least one B AND at least one b is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nTherefore",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So all phenotypes in this case would be either red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. But given that the parents are homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for another, the F2 would include all four phenotypes. Wait, but according to the options provided, the correct answer seems to involve checking which phenotypes are expressed.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Let's consider the possible gametes from each parent. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes because both alleles are dominant. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb gametes because both alleles are recessive. Therefore, the F1 (which is CcBb) can only receive CB from each parent, making all its gametes CB. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, and it selfs. The gametes it produces would be CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. Because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes from F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in four possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB (same as above)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (both c and b)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown (duplicate)\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown (duplicate)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the F2 genotypes after selfing would be as follows:\n\nEach F2 bird can have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdditionally, the other possibility is Cc BB and cc bb, but those combine into the same phenotypes as above because the c in the second position (for pigment) doesn\u2019t affect the overall phenotype. Wait, no\u2014actually, the c affects the pigment color. So:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, Cc BB and cc bb don't change the fact that the bird is Brown regardless of the pigment color.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2. But our calculation shows 25%, 50%, 25% for the phenotypes, which sums to 100%. However, the options don't directly reflect this unless scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are referring to the actual count rather than percentages. Let me recalculate the counts assuming a large number of birds. For example, if we have 16 birds:\n\n- 4 checkered red (25% of 16)\n- 8 checkered brown (50% of 16)\n- 4 plain brown (25% of 16)\n\nBut the options don't align with this. Wait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That adds up to 18, which isn't divisible by 16. Maybe the options are mislabeled, or I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 selfed twice, but the F1 itself is already crossed, so F2 would be the next generation. Wait, the question states \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2, which includes the four phenotypes I outlined earlier. \n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds, which fits. However, my calculation showed 25% checkered red, 50% checkered brown, 25% plain brown. So in a sample of 16 birds, 4 would be checkered red, 8 checkered brown, and 4 plain brown. This doesn't match option D. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question mentions a checkered pattern controlled by the recessive allele c. Wait, hold on! There's confusion here. In the initial description, the recessive allele c controls the plain color, which is checkered. Wait, no: the user wrote:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nWait, wait\u2014that's conflicting. Usually, in genetics, the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, if B is dominant for brown, then b would mask the black color, but here, it's stated that b causes plain color. So perhaps the correct understanding is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered (the recessive allele for the plain color). Wait, no\u2014the original statement was: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThis seems reversed. Normally, the dominant allele masks the recessive one, so if B is dominant for brown, then b would cause the lack of brown (i.e., plain). But here, it's written that b causes plain color, implying that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for something else. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn standard terminology, the dominant allele B would allow the bird to exhibit brown (if B is associated with brown) and the recessive allele b would prevent brown, allowing them to display a different color, say checkered. But according to the user's problem statement, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, b is the dominant allele for brown and recessive for checkered. That can't be right because usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. So perhaps the intended meaning is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, meaning that both B and b are dominant, and the recessive alleles are absent. But that contradicts the usual notation where uppercase letters represent dominant traits and lowercase recessive. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for checkered, making B and b both dominant alleles. But that would mean that the bird is always brown, which contradicts the initial statement saying that brown color is determined by the recessive allele b. Therefore, perhaps the user made a typo, and instead of b being the recessive allele for brown, it's the dominant allele for brown. Let me proceed under the assumption that B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for checkered, meaning that the recessive alleles are not present. So, the presence of B results in brown, and the presence of b results in checkered. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for something else, but it's unclear. To resolve this, I'll assume that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered. Thus, the presence of B allows brown, and the presence of b allows checkered. This way, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b present)\n\nAnd the absence of both (B recessive and b recessive) would be plain. So, now, going back to the F2 generation. The F2 phenotypes would be determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (B and b present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, b absent)\n3. Checkered and Plain (B absent, b present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B absent, b absent)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown and Checkered\nProbability = P(B) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this would imply certainty, which may not be the case. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then having at least one dominant allele in either gene results in the corresponding trait. So the presence of B means brown, and the presence of b means checkered. So all birds with at least one B (brown) and at least one b (checkered) would be brown and checkered. Conversely, birds without B (pB=0) but with b (pb=1) would be checkered and plain. Similarly, birds without b (pb=0) but with B (pB=1) would be brown and plain. Birds without B and without b would be plain and plain.)\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, which is a double\u6742\u5408\u4f53. Upon selfing, the F2 would have various genotypes, including those where B is present, b is present, both, neither, etc.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, which is the cross of a homozygous CcBB and a homozygous ccbb bird. Wait, no\u2014the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Wait, but the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1. So the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1, not from the parents themselves. So the F2 will be generated by crossing the F1 (CcBb) with itself. \n\nTo create the Punnett square for F2, we list the possible gametes from each parent. From CC BB, the only gamete is CB. From cc bb, the only gamete is cb. Therefore, the F2 will have gametes formed by CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, and cb \u00d7 cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB (same as above)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Same as above\n- cc bb \u2192 Same as above\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 50% (from Cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (from cc bb)\n\nIf we take 16 birds as a sample, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Checkered Brown: 8 (50% of 16)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this exact distribution. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total is 16 birds. This seems to suggest that only 1 bird is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. Wait, that doesn't fit our calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the number of individuals showing each phenotype without considering dominance, but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the recessive alleles differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused the roles of B and b. If B were dominant for brown and b dominant for checkered, then the presence of B would lead to brown, and the presence of b would lead to checkered. Without B, you get plain. And with b, you get checkered regardless of B. This would change the possible phenotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem with this corrected interpretation. If B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B (dominant for brown) will have brown color.\n- Any bird with at least one b (dominant for checkered) will have checkered color.\n- Birds without B and without b (homozygous recessive for both traits) will have plain color.\n\nUnder this scenario, the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the presence of B and b in their genotype.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (has B and b)\n2. Brown and Plain (has B, no b)\n3. Checkered and Plain (no B, has b)\n4. Plain and Plain (no B and no b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having B (dominant) is 1 (since any B allele makes them brown). Similarly, the probability of having b (dominant) is 1. However, since the genes are independent, the combined probability of having at least one B and at least one b is zero because B and b are both dominant, meaning any bird will have at least one dominant allele for both traits. Wait, no\u2014if B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then having at least one B will make them brown, and having at least one b will make them checkered. So the only way a bird could have neither is if both are recessive (no B and no b).\n\nBut in reality, since both B and b are dominant, any bird will have at least one dominant allele for both traits, meaning that all birds will have both brown and checkered colors. Therefore, all phenotypes would be brown and checkered. But this contradicts the initial problem statement, which said that checkered is due to the recessive allele c, and brown due to B. So perhaps the user mixed up the alleles.\n\nAssuming the correct interpretation is that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for checkered, then all F2 birds will have both brown and checkered colors, leading to a single phenotype. However, this contradicts the initial problem statement regarding the F2 phenotypes listed in the options. Therefore, I must reconcile this.\n\nPerhaps the user intended that B is dominant for brown and b is dominant for the absence of checkered (i.e., b is the recessive allele for checkered). That is, B is dominant for brown, and b is dominant for the recessive trait (like having checkered), while the presence of a dominant c allele would result in plain color. But the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So if b is the recessive allele for brown and B is dominant for brown, then the presence of B would result in brown, and the presence of b would result in checkered. \n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, if B is dominant for brown, then b would cause the absence of brown, i.e., plain color. Similarly, if b is dominant for checkered, then B would cause the absence of checkered, i.e., plain color. Wait, this seems contradictory because typically, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user mixed up the roles of B and b. Let me try to clarify once again:\n\n- Gene B: Red (dominant) and Brown (recessive)\n- Gene b: Checkered (dominant) and plain (recessive)\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, brown is expressed only when the B allele is recessive. Similarly, checkered is expressed only when the b allele is recessive. Therefore, the presence of B (dominant) results in brown, and the presence of b (dominant) results in checkered. The absence of both (B recessive and b recessive) results in plain.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Brown and Checkered: Both B and b present\n- Brown and Plain: B present, b absent\n- Checkered and Plain: B absent, b present\n- Plain and Plain: B absent, b absent\n\nNow, with this model, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown and Checkered (B and b present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, b absent)\n3. Checkered and Plain (B absent, b present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B absent, b absent)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Probability of B and b present. Since B is dominant, having at least one B allele results in brown. Similarly, having at least one b allele results in checkered. So the probability of having at least one B and at least one b is calculated as follows:\n\nThe chance of having at least one B is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the chance of having at least one b is 1 - (probability of BB) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSince B and b are independent, the probability of having at least one B AND at least one b is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nTherefore",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown (100%)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered (0%)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown (0%)\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain and checkered (0%)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all birds are either fully pigmented and brown or none of those. But that contradicts the idea that each bird could be a different combination. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the dominant alleles results in the respective trait, regardless of dominance. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered. So, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles. Let's consider each bird's genotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Heterozygous (Cc) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Brown\n- Heterozygous (Bb) \u2192 Brown\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All possible except when C is absent or B is absent.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): When C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): When C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): When both C and B are absent.\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated by the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's define:\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) = P(C) = 1 (since both parents are heterozygous and the F1 is heterozygous)\nWait, no\u2014actually, the F1 is CcBb. So for pigment color (C):\n- C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have pigment red.\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will have brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nThe probability of Pigment red is always 1 (since any C allele makes it red).\nThe probability of Pigment red and brown is also 1, because if it's red, it must be brown (since C is dominant over c).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 All such birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Only when C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Only when C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 When both C and B are absent.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown (phenotype 1):\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. Since both parents are heterozygous, the probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and at least one B is 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\nThe probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and the probability of having no B (i.e., at least one b) is 1/4 (since B is dominant). So, the probability is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\nProbability of C absent is 1/4, and B present is 3/4. So, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (C absent, B absent)\nProbability of C absent is 1/4, and B absent is 1/4. So, (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which accounts for the denominator 16. So the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which matches our calculation. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9,\" which seems reversed. Other options don't match our numbers. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown (100%)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered (0%)\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown (0%)\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain and checkered (0%)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all birds are either fully pigmented and brown or none of those. But that contradicts the idea that each bird could be a different combination. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the dominant alleles results in the respective trait, regardless of dominance. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered. So, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles. Let's consider each bird's genotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Heterozygous (Cc) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Brown\n- Heterozygous (Bb) \u2192 Brown\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All possible except when C is absent or B is absent.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): When C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): When C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): When both C and B are absent.\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated by the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's define:\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) = P(C) = 1 (since both parents are heterozygous and the F1 is heterozygous)\nWait, no\u2014actually, the F1 is CcBb. So for pigment color (C):\n- C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will have pigment red.\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will have brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nThe probability of Pigment red is always 1 (since any C allele makes it red).\nThe probability of Pigment red and brown is also 1, because if it's red, it must be brown (since C is dominant over c).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 All such birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Only when C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Only when C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 When both C and B are absent.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown (phenotype 1):\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. Since both parents are heterozygous, the probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and at least one B is 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\nThe probability of having at least one C is 3/4, and the probability of having no B (i.e., at least one b) is 1/4 (since B is dominant). So, the probability is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\nProbability of C absent is 1/4, and B present is 3/4. So, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (C absent, B absent)\nProbability of C absent is 1/4, and B absent is 1/4. So, (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which accounts for the denominator 16. So the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which matches our calculation. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9,\" which seems reversed. Other options don't match our numbers. So the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So the phenotypic ratios are based on how often both traits appear together. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC: Pigment red (C present)\n- cc: Plain (c absent)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB: Brown (B present)\n- bb: Checkered (b absent)\n\nSo the combined phenotypes are all four possible combinations:\n1. Pigment red and brown (CC BB)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (CC bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc BB)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each?\n\nEach bird has two copies of each gene. Since the parents are homozygous, all offspring will inherit one copy from each parent. So for Gene C:\nParent 1: CC \u2192 contributes C\nParent 2: cc \u2192 contributes c\nSo F1 (and hence F2) will be Cc, with a 50% chance of each allele.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\nParent 1: BB \u2192 contributes B\nParent 2: bb \u2192 contributes b\nSo F1 will be Bb, with a 50% chance of each allele.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of each combination is:\n\n1. C (from Gene C) and B (Gene B):\n  - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nWait, that seems off because it suggests 100% of the birds have both traits, which isn't realistic. Let me re-examine. The actual probabilities should consider that each gene's expression is independent. So for each bird, the probability of having both traits is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 all offspring will get C from them.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 all offspring will get c from them.\n\nThus, F1 will always be Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), making their phenotypes CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from Cc + Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc + Bb)\n- cc (from Bb + Bb)\n- bb (from Bb + Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is present.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered red and brown\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain and brown\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we calculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nEach F2 bird has a certain probability of each phenotype. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probabilities are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since \u00be of the F2 have at least one C)\n- P(c) = \u00bc\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(B) = 3/4 (\u00be of the F2 have at least one B)\n- P(b) = \u00bc\n\nHowever, since each trait is expressed independently, the combined phenotypes are calculated by considering the probabilities of each combination.\n\nBut since the presence of each trait is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering all possible combinations where both traits are expressed or not.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations and their probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B: Phenotype 1 (Checkered red and brown)\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C and not B: Phenotype 2 (Checkered red and checkered)\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(not B) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Not C and B: Phenotype 3 (Plain red and brown)\n   - Probability = P(not C) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither C nor B: Phenotype 4 (Plain red and checkered)\n   - Probability = P(not C) * P(not B) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes in the order Checkered red and brown : Checkered red and checkered : Plain red and brown : Plain red and checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly.

    "rollout": " But looking back, the question says \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown body color. So the phenotype can be:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (so both traits expressed)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but in reality, if a bird has C, it will have pigment red regardless of B, and similarly, if it has B, it will have brown regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes are combinations where either pigment is red, or body is brown, or both. The fourth possibility would be neither, which isn't applicable here because every bird must have at least one of the dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each. Since the genes are independent:\n\nFor Pigment red: P(C) = 1 (since C is dominant)\nFor Pigment checkered: P(c) = 1 (since c is recessive)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFor Brown color: P(B) = 1\nFor Checkered: P(b) = 1\n\nSo the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have red pigment, but checkered body.\n3. Plain and brown: P(c) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have plain body, red pigment.\n4. Plain and checkered: P(c) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have plain body, checkered.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if all phenotypes are certain, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer options match this. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: It says that the checkered pattern is controlled by gene C, which is dominant. So, if a bird has at least one C, it will display the checkered pattern. Similarly, brown color is controlled by gene B, which is dominant. So, any bird with at least one B will have brown color. The presence of both dominant alleles results in both traits being expressed.\n\nTherefore, all birds in this population will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or one for body (B). Thus, all possible phenotypes exist, leading to four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nSince each bird must have at least one dominant allele, these are the only possibilities. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts the given answer choices, which don't have such a ratio. This suggests that my understanding is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the checkered pattern is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over red. Or vice versa. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: \n- Checkered pattern controlled by gene C (dominant)\n- Plain pattern controlled by c (recessive)\n- Red color controlled by B (dominant)\n- Brown color controlled by b (recessive)\n\nWait, this could mean that both C and B are required for the phenotype. Because if C is dominant, any bird with at least one C has red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with at least one B has brown body, regardless of C. So the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. Therefore, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or one for body (B), resulting in four phenotypes as before.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which has a ratio of 3:1, but that's for dihybrids. Hmm. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for pigment does not necessarily lead to the checkered pattern unless both C and B are present. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is dominant over plain, but the presence of a dominant B leads to brown instead of red. That would change things.\n\nLet me try interpreting the dominance hierarchy differently. Suppose:\n\n- The checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c), so any bird with at least one C has a checkered pattern.\n- The red color (B) is dominant over brown (b), so any bird with at least one B has red color.\nThus, a bird with at least one C and at least one B would have both checkered pattern and red color.\n\nA bird with at least one C and without B would have checkered pattern and brown color.\n\nA bird with at least one c and at least B would have plain pattern and red color.\n\nA bird with neither C nor B would have plain pattern and brown color.\n\nIn this case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered pattern and red color\n2. Checkered pattern and brown color\n3. Plain pattern and red color\n4. Plain pattern and brown color\n\nCalculating the probabilities now:\n\nThe probability of having at least one C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\nThe probability of having at least one B is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nHowever, since these events are independent, the combined probabilities would be:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither C nor B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't consider that having C alone doesn't mean anything for B, but the presence of both C and B would determine the phenotype. So the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations above.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the number of ways each phenotype can occur.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to 9:3:3:1 inverted. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which is different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. Option B is 6:2:6:2, same as A but different numbers. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check. Oh, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums up to 18, whereas 9+3+3+1 is 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what I got. But the options don't list C as an option; the highest numbered option is G. Wait, checking the user's input again, the options are labeled A to J, with G being 9:3:3:1.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But looking back, the question says \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if C is dominant, then any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown body color. So the phenotype can be:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (so both traits expressed)\n- C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but in reality, if a bird has C, it will have pigment red regardless of B, and similarly, if it has B, it will have brown regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes are combinations where either pigment is red, or body is brown, or both. The fourth possibility would be neither, which isn't applicable here because every bird must have at least one of the dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each. Since the genes are independent:\n\nFor Pigment red: P(C) = 1 (since C is dominant)\nFor Pigment checkered: P(c) = 1 (since c is recessive)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFor Brown color: P(B) = 1\nFor Checkered: P(b) = 1\n\nSo the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have red pigment, but checkered body.\n3. Plain and brown: P(c) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have plain body, red pigment.\n4. Plain and checkered: P(c) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All have plain body, checkered.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if all phenotypes are certain, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer options match this. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: It says that the checkered pattern is controlled by gene C, which is dominant. So, if a bird has at least one C, it will display the checkered pattern. Similarly, brown color is controlled by gene B, which is dominant. So, any bird with at least one B will have brown color. The presence of both dominant alleles results in both traits being expressed.\n\nTherefore, all birds in this population will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or one for body (B). Thus, all possible phenotypes exist, leading to four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nSince each bird must have at least one dominant allele, these are the only possibilities. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts the given answer choices, which don't have such a ratio. This suggests that my understanding is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the checkered pattern is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over red. Or vice versa. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: \n- Checkered pattern controlled by gene C (dominant)\n- Plain pattern controlled by c (recessive)\n- Red color controlled by B (dominant)\n- Brown color controlled by b (recessive)\n\nWait, this could mean that both C and B are required for the phenotype. Because if C is dominant, any bird with at least one C has red pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with at least one B has brown body, regardless of C. So the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. Therefore, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and/or one for body (B), resulting in four phenotypes as before.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is E, which has a ratio of 3:1, but that's for dihybrids. Hmm. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the presence of a dominant allele for pigment does not necessarily lead to the checkered pattern unless both C and B are present. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is dominant over plain, but the presence of a dominant B leads to brown instead of red. That would change things.\n\nLet me try interpreting the dominance hierarchy differently. Suppose:\n\n- The checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c), so any bird with at least one C has a checkered pattern.\n- The red color (B) is dominant over brown (b), so any bird with at least one B has red color.\nThus, a bird with at least one C and at least one B would have both checkered pattern and red color.\n\nA bird with at least one C and without B would have checkered pattern and brown color.\n\nA bird with at least one c and at least B would have plain pattern and red color.\n\nA bird with neither C nor B would have plain pattern and brown color.\n\nIn this case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered pattern and red color\n2. Checkered pattern and brown color\n3. Plain pattern and red color\n4. Plain pattern and brown color\n\nCalculating the probabilities now:\n\nThe probability of having at least one C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\nThe probability of having at least one B is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nHowever, since these events are independent, the combined probabilities would be:\n\n1. Both C and B: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither C nor B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't consider that having C alone doesn't mean anything for B, but the presence of both C and B would determine the phenotype. So the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations above.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the number of ways each phenotype can occur.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to 9:3:3:1 inverted. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which is different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. Option B is 6:2:6:2, same as A but different numbers. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check. Oh, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums up to 18, whereas 9+3+3+1 is 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what I got. But the options don't list C as an option; the highest numbered option is G. Wait, checking the user's input again, the options are labeled A to J, with G being 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer would be option G, which is 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation.\n\nBut looking back, the user's options were:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 6,2,6,2\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 9,3,3,1\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But wait, in the initial instructions, the user listed options starting from A to J, with G being 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be G. However, looking at the user's message, the options are presented as A to J, with G being the last option. Therefore, the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, some birds may not have one trait even if they have another.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, some birds may not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no, because each trait is determined separately. So a bird could have pigment red (due to C) and plain (due to c) regardless of their coloration. Similarly, a bird could have pigment red and brown regardless of their color. So in this case, all birds will have both traits because either C or c will determine pigment, and either B or b will determine color. So the phenotypes are combinations of pigment and color traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This is possible because the bird has C and B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Bird has C and b.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Bird has c and B.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Bird has c and b.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the segregation follows Mendel's laws. Assuming independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor example, for phenotype 1 (red and brown):\nP(C) = 1 (since C is dominant over c)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is dominant over b)\nSo P(phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100% chance? That seems off. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the bird's phenotype being certain, but rather the possible expression of traits. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the actual observed phenotypes, not the theoretical probabilities. Let me read the question again: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So we need to see what phenotypes appear in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation's genotypes. The options given include various ratios, so I'll proceed by constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the user already provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, which is helpful, but perhaps the focus is on the F2. However, the initial instruction says to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, identify the genotypes of the parents for the F2 generation. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). So F1 (CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But due to the independent assortment, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the question specifies to use the F2 data provided, including the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So I need to look at the provided options and see which matches the expected outcome.\n\nLooking at the options A through H, each provides different phenotypic ratios. To determine which one is correct, I need to calculate the probabilities of each phenotype based on the F2 generation. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine the results.\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nGene B (color):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes are products of the individual gene expressions.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nWait, but that suggests 100% of the birds have both traits, which isn't realistic because some birds might not have one trait even if another does. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the traits work here. Wait, each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So a bird can have red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. All four combinations are possible. Now, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes' contributions.\n\nLet's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B):\n   - C must be present (prob = 1)\n   - B must be present (prob = 1)\n   - Total prob = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b):\n   - C present (prob = 1)\n   - b present (prob = 0.5)\n   - Total prob = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n   - c present (prob = 0.5)\n   - B present (prob = 1)\n   - Total prob = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n   - c present (prob = 0.5)\n   - b present (prob = 0.5)\n   - Total prob = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 1\n- Pigment red and checkered: 0.5\n- Plain and brown: 0.5\n- Plain and checkered: 0.25\n\nWait, but adding these up: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which exceeds 1. This indicates an error in calculation. The mistake arises because each gene's contribution is multiplicative, but when considering two independent genes, the total probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities, not simply additive. However, since each bird must have one of the four possible combinations, the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles for both genes. The probabilities for each combination are as follows:\n\n- C (pigment) and B (color): 1 * 1 = 1\n- C and b: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n- c and B: 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n- c and b: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25. Which still sums to more than 1. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is flawed. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, so the probabilities should be considered as fractions relative to the possible combinations. The correct way is to recognize that each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, leading to specific phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 25%\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): 25%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): 25%\n\nWait, but this also sums to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population. That aligns with option D, where the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:3:1. Because:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 1/4\n\nWait, but that would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,1,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 6 parts, but our calculation shows four equal parts. So none of the options seem to match. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-examine the options. Option D states a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:3:1. How does that happen?\n\nIf each phenotype represents different numbers based on the number of dominant alleles, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the count of dominant vs. recessive alleles in each trait. For example:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Count of dominant alleles: 2 (C and B) \u2192 Ratio 2:2 = 1:1\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Count: 1 (C) :1 (b) \u2192 Ratio 1:1\n- Phenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Count: 0 (c) :1 (B) \u2192 Ratio 0:1 \u2192 But this doesn't fit the options.\n- Phenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Count: 0 (c) :0 (b) \u2192 Ratio 0:0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nThis line of reasoning isn't helping. Perhaps I should consider the actual genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. The correct approach is to list all possible genotypes for the F2 generation and map them to phenotypes, then calculate the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\n- 25% CC (genotype: C C)\n- 50% Cc (genotype: C c)\n- 25% cc (genotype: c c)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (red, brown)\n3. CC bb (red, checkered)\n4. Cc BB (red, brown)\n5. Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n6. Cc bb (red, checkered)\n7. cc BB (plain, brown)\n8. cc Bb (plain, brown)\n9. cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1.

Let me recount based on the numbered cases:\n\nPhenotype 1: Cases 1,2,4,5,7,8 \u2192 6\nPhenotype 2: Case 3 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 3: Case 3 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 4: Case 4 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 has 6, Phenotype 2 has 1, Phenotype 3 has 1, Phenotype 4 has 1. Adding them up: 6+1+1+1=9, which totals the 9 cases. But according to the options, the ratios vary. However, looking at the options, option D is 1:1:3:1, which would correspond to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4 as 1:1:3:1. But according to my current understanding, Phenotype 1 is 6, Phenotype 2 is 1, Phenotype 3 is 1, Phenotype 4 is 1. That doesn't fit into the 1:1:3:1 ratio.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something in the mapping. Let's reconsider the genotypic frequencies. The F2 generation includes the following genotypic frequencies:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 1\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3 (Red, Checkered)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 1\n- cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (3), Cc Bb (4), Cc bb (5) \u2192 5 cases\n- Phenotype 3: CC bb (6) \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype 2: cc BB (7), cc Bb (8) \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4: cc bb (9) \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+1+2+1=9, which is correct. Now, the phenotypic frequencies are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 5/9\n- Phenotype 3: 1/9\n- Phenotype 2: 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9\n\nBut this doesn't directly translate to the options provided. Looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this distribution. Option D is 1:1:3:1, which would imply:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1 part\n- Phenotype 2: 1 part\n- Phenotype 3: 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4: 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 6. But according to our calculation, Phenotype 1 is 5, Phenotype 3 is 1, Phenotype 2 is 2, Phenotype 4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the ratio of Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4, summed appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are listing the phenotypic ratios based on the number of dominant alleles, such as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: At least one dominant allele for both traits \u2192 2 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype 2: One dominant allele for pigment and none for color \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 3: None for pigment and one for color \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 4: None for both \u2192 0\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:1:1:0. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the initial assumption about the question. The user provided a table of F2 phenotypes and their genotypic frequencies. The options provided include various ratios, such as 1:1:3:1, which likely refers to the phenotypic ratio after accounting for the genotypic frequencies.\n\nHowever, based on the standard Punnett square analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation in this scenario should be 2:1:1:1 for the two traits, leading to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4 = 2:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Upon closer examination, option D states 1:1:3:1, which doesn't align with my calculations. It's possible that I made an error in the calculation, or the options are based on a different model.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is focusing solely on the presence of pigment and color, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. In that case, the phenotypes would be determined by whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 present \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 absent pigment \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 absent pigment and color \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the genotypic frequencies for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb (25%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 3: CC bb (25%), Cc bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc BB (25%), cc Bb (25%), cc bb (25%) \u2192 75%\n\nBut this doesn't match the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying by treating each trait independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, but this isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll proceed to analyze the options provided and see which one fits best based on standard Mendelian ratios.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, some birds may not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no, because each trait is determined separately. So a bird could have pigment red (due to C) and plain (due to c) regardless of their coloration. Similarly, a bird could have pigment red and brown regardless of their color. So in this case, all birds will have both traits because either C or c will determine pigment, and either B or b will determine color. So the phenotypes are combinations of pigment and color traits. Let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This is possible because the bird has C and B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Bird has C and b.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Bird has c and B.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Bird has c and b.\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the segregation follows Mendel's laws. Assuming independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor example, for phenotype 1 (red and brown):\nP(C) = 1 (since C is dominant over c)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is dominant over b)\nSo P(phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100% chance? That seems off. Wait, no\u2014it's not about the bird's phenotype being certain, but rather the possible expression of traits. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking about the actual observed phenotypes, not the theoretical probabilities. Let me read the question again: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So we need to see what phenotypes appear in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation's genotypes. The options given include various ratios, so I'll proceed by constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the user already provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, which is helpful, but perhaps the focus is on the F2. However, the initial instruction says to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, identify the genotypes of the parents for the F2 generation. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). So F1 (CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But due to the independent assortment, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the question specifies to use the F2 data provided, including the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So I need to look at the provided options and see which matches the expected outcome.\n\nLooking at the options A through H, each provides different phenotypic ratios. To determine which one is correct, I need to calculate the probabilities of each phenotype based on the F2 generation. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine the results.\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nGene B (color):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes are products of the individual gene expressions.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nWait, but that suggests 100% of the birds have both traits, which isn't realistic because some birds might not have one trait even if another does. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the traits work here. Wait, each bird has two traits: pigment and color. So a bird can have red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered. All four combinations are possible. Now, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes' contributions.\n\nLet's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B):\n   - C must be present (prob = 1)\n   - B must be present (prob = 1)\n   - Total prob = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype: red and brown\n\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b):\n   - C present (prob = 1)\n   - b present (prob = 0.5)\n   - Total prob = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 Phenotype: red and checkered\n\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B):\n   - c present (prob = 0.5)\n   - B present (prob = 1)\n   - Total prob = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 Phenotype: plain and brown\n\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b):\n   - c present (prob = 0.5)\n   - b present (prob = 0.5)\n   - Total prob = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Phenotype: plain and checkered\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 1\n- Pigment red and checkered: 0.5\n- Plain and brown: 0.5\n- Plain and checkered: 0.25\n\nWait, but adding these up: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which exceeds 1. This indicates an error in calculation. The mistake arises because each gene's contribution is multiplicative, but when considering two independent genes, the total probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities, not simply additive. However, since each bird must have one of the four possible combinations, the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles for both genes. The probabilities for each combination are as follows:\n\n- C (pigment) and B (color): 1 * 1 = 1\n- C and b: 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n- c and B: 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n- c and b: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25. Which still sums to more than 1. This inconsistency suggests that my approach is flawed. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, so the probabilities should be considered as fractions relative to the possible combinations. The correct way is to recognize that each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, leading to specific phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 25%\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant): 25%\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive): 25%\n\nWait, but this also sums to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population. That aligns with option D, where the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:3:1. Because:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 1/4\n\nWait, but that would mean a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,1,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 6 parts, but our calculation shows four equal parts. So none of the options seem to match. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-examine the options. Option D states a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:3:1. How does that happen?\n\nIf each phenotype represents different numbers based on the number of dominant alleles, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the count of dominant vs. recessive alleles in each trait. For example:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Count of dominant alleles: 2 (C and B) \u2192 Ratio 2:2 = 1:1\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Count: 1 (C) :1 (b) \u2192 Ratio 1:1\n- Phenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Count: 0 (c) :1 (B) \u2192 Ratio 0:1 \u2192 But this doesn't fit the options.\n- Phenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Count: 0 (c) :0 (b) \u2192 Ratio 0:0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nThis line of reasoning isn't helping. Perhaps I should consider the actual genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. The correct approach is to list all possible genotypes for the F2 generation and map them to phenotypes, then calculate the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\n- 25% CC (genotype: C C)\n- 50% Cc (genotype: C c)\n- 25% cc (genotype: c c)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (red, brown)\n3. CC bb (red, checkered)\n4. Cc BB (red, brown)\n5. Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n6. Cc bb (red, checkered)\n7. cc BB (plain, brown)\n8. cc Bb (plain, brown)\n9. cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (C), Color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red (C), Color checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype 1\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype 2\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Cases 1,2,4,5,7,8 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype 2: Cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype 3: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype 4: Case 4 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, this counts differently than I thought earlier. Let me recount based on the numbered cases:\n\nPhenotype 1: Cases 1,2,4,5,7,8 \u2192 6\nPhenotype 2: Case 3 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 3: Case 3 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 4: Case 4 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 has 6, Phenotype 2 has 1, Phenotype 3 has 1, Phenotype 4 has 1. Adding them up: 6+1+1+1=9, which totals the 9 cases. But according to the options, the ratios vary. However, looking at the options, option D is 1:1:3:1, which would correspond to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4 as 1:1:3:1. But according to my current understanding, Phenotype 1 is 6, Phenotype 2 is 1, Phenotype 3 is 1, Phenotype 4 is 1. That doesn't fit into the 1:1:3:1 ratio.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something in the mapping. Let's reconsider the genotypic frequencies. The F2 generation includes the following genotypic frequencies:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 1\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3 (Red, Checkered)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 1\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 1\n- cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n- cc bb: Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (3), Cc Bb (4), Cc bb (5) \u2192 5 cases\n- Phenotype 3: CC bb (6) \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype 2: cc BB (7), cc Bb (8) \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4: cc bb (9) \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 5+1+2+1=9, which is correct. Now, the phenotypic frequencies are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 5/9\n- Phenotype 3: 1/9\n- Phenotype 2: 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9\n\nBut this doesn't directly translate to the options provided. Looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this distribution. Option D is 1:1:3:1, which would imply:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1 part\n- Phenotype 2: 1 part\n- Phenotype 3: 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4: 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 6. But according to our calculation, Phenotype 1 is 5, Phenotype 3 is 1, Phenotype 2 is 2, Phenotype 4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the ratio of Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4, summed appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are listing the phenotypic ratios based on the number of dominant alleles, such as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: At least one dominant allele for both traits \u2192 2 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype 2: One dominant allele for pigment and none for color \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 3: None for pigment and one for color \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 4: None for both \u2192 0\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:1:1:0. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the initial assumption about the question. The user provided a table of F2 phenotypes and their genotypic frequencies. The options provided include various ratios, such as 1:1:3:1, which likely refers to the phenotypic ratio after accounting for the genotypic frequencies.\n\nHowever, based on the standard Punnett square analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation in this scenario should be 2:1:1:1 for the two traits, leading to Phenotype 1: Phenotype 2: Phenotype 3: Phenotype 4 = 2:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Upon closer examination, option D states 1:1:3:1, which doesn't align with my calculations. It's possible that I made an error in the calculation, or the options are based on a different model.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is focusing solely on the presence of pigment and color, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. In that case, the phenotypes would be determined by whether each trait is present. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 present \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 present \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 absent pigment \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 absent pigment and color \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the genotypic frequencies for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb (25%), Cc BB (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 3: CC bb (25%), Cc bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc BB (25%), cc Bb (25%), cc bb (25%) \u2192 75%\n\nBut this doesn't match the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying by treating each trait independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, but this isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll proceed to analyze the options provided and see which one fits best based on standard Mendelian ratios.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if either gene is recessive.",
    "rollout": " So the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if either gene is recessive. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1.

Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits?\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because P(C) is 1 (always red) and P(B) is 1 (always brown) in this scenario, so all birds expressed both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. The actual calculation should consider the possibility that some birds might not have certain traits if one gene is dominant and the other is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. So, for the C gene, if it's dominant (C), the bird has red pigment; if recessive (c), it's plain. Similarly for the B gene: if dominant (B), brown; else, checkered. Therefore, all birds expressed both traits, which seems unlikely. But according to the given genes, yes, so all birds in this cross would have both traits. But that can\u2019t be right because then the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. Oh, wait\u2014the question asks about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which may imply that not all birds necessarily have both traits. Maybe I've misapplied the principles. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is intended to produce birds where at least one gene shows a dominant trait. But I think my approach is correct. Let me try calculating the probabilities differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes. So the probability is P(C) + P(c) for the C gene times P(B) + P(b) for the B gene minus the overlap (but wait, since both are being considered together, it's simply (P(C) + P(c)) * (P(B) + P(b)) - but that's not accurate. Instead, the correct formula is:\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C) * P(B) + P(c) * P(B) + P(C) * P(b) + P(c) * P(b)\n\nBut simplifying, since P(c) = 1 - P(C) and P(b) = 1 - P(B):\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C)*P(B) + (1-P(C))*P(B) + P(C)*(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))*(1-P(B))\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n= P(C)P(B) + (1-P(C))P(B) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= [P(C)P(B) + (1-P(C))P(B)] + [P(C)(1-P(B))] + [(1-P(C))(1-P(B))]\nFactor terms:\n= P(B)[P(C) + (1-P(C))] + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= P(B)(1) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= P(B) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\nNotice that (1-P(C))(1-P(B)) appears twice, so factor them out:\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))[P(C) + (1-P(C))]\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))[1]\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))\n= 1\n\nSo, all birds have pigment red and/or brown. Wait, but that contradicts our earlier assumption. This suggests that all birds will exhibit both traits, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the fact that some birds might not have both traits, leading to a different calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed differently. Let me instead consider the possible F2 phenotypes and their ratios without worrying about the exact probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 generation based on the F1 cross. Wait, the F1 cross was between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, the F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. As before, the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But considering the independent assortment, each gamete type is equally likely, so the F2 would have 25% of each combination. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But how do these translate into the overall phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to specific combinations of traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Occurs when at least one dominant allele for both genes is present. In terms of gametes, this happens when a CB or a CB gamete contributes. But wait, no\u2014gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. To get pigment red, the bird must receive at least one C. To get brown, at least one B. So, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are present. So, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles inherited from each parent. \n\nLet me list all possible combinations in the F2:\n\n1. CB gametes: C from F1 and B from F1. So, C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n2. cb gametes: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain and checkered.\n3. cB gametes: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain and brown.\n4. cb gametes: same as above.\n\nNow, considering all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (all C and B present)\n- CC bb (all C, b)\n- cc BB (c, B)\n- cc bb (c, b)\n\nThen, their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown\n- CC bb: Pigment red and plain\n- cc BB: Plain and brown\n- cc bb: Plain and checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and plain\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 depends on the frequency of each genotype. Since each genotype is represented by 25% in the F2, we can calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown) includes all individuals who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. These include the CC BB (100%), CC bb (50%), and cc BB (50%). Wait, no\u2014it's easier to count the number of each genotype and then map to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of traits, and each genotype represents a unique combination, the number of each phenotype in the F2 is proportional to the number of ways each phenotype can occur. However, since each bird has exactly one genotype, each phenotype's count is based on how many F2 individuals fall into that category.\n\nIn the F2, each of the four possible genotypes (CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb) occurs with equal frequency (25%). Each of these genotypes maps to a distinct phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red and plain\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% for each phenotype. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect 1:1:1:1. Instead, the options are structured around checking the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H provide various phenotypic ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of these match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering all four phenotypes. Let me verify the mapping again. The four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and plain: Phenotype 2\n- Plain and brown: Phenotype 3\n- Plain and checkered: Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a unique combination of the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, the number of birds with each phenotype is determined by the number of ways each combination can occur. However, since each bird has only one genotype, each phenotype's occurrence is based on the number of F2 individuals with that genotype. But in reality, each bird's genotype uniquely defines their phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this. Looking back at the user's message, they included options G through H, which seem to involve phenotypic ratios with zero counts. Option D says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, with a 2:6:3:1 ratio, which sums to 12. Another option is E with 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It mentions \"the expected phenotypic ratio\" based on the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of F1 to F2, but that doesn't align with the wording. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, and the correct ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct ratio is supposed to be a multiple of these numbers. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of F1 to F2, but that's not what's stated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not helpful.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects a balanced distribution among the phenotypes, which could correspond to a 2:6:3:1 ratio or similar. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 12. But this doesn't perfectly divide into a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option E (checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3) totals 16, which is plausible if each phenotype occurs in multiples of 3, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, the closest might be option D, which sums to 12. However, none of the options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which matches option A. How does that happen? Well, each phenotype occurs in groups of 6, 2, 6, 2, summing to 16. That would suggest that each phenotype is represented by 6, 2, 6, 2 birds. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct ratio is not among the options provided, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option E, which totals 16. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unusual.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose option A, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, totaling 16. This assumes that each phenotype occurs in pairs, but without clear reasoning, it's difficult to justify.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each of the four phenotypes in the F2 generation has a 25% chance, but due to overlapping traits, the actual counts differ. For example, checkered red and plain brown might appear in larger numbers than others, depending on the dominance hierarchy. However, without further details, it's challenging to determine the exact ratio.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, corresponding to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if either gene is recessive. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive.\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant.\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits?\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because P(C) is 1 (always red) and P(B) is 1 (always brown) in this scenario, so all birds expressed both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. The actual calculation should consider the possibility that some birds might not have certain traits if one gene is dominant and the other is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. So, for the C gene, if it's dominant (C), the bird has red pigment; if recessive (c), it's plain. Similarly for the B gene: if dominant (B), brown; else, checkered. Therefore, all birds expressed both traits, which seems unlikely. But according to the given genes, yes, so all birds in this cross would have both traits. But that can\u2019t be right because then the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. Oh, wait\u2014the question asks about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, which may imply that not all birds necessarily have both traits. Maybe I've misapplied the principles. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is intended to produce birds where at least one gene shows a dominant trait. But I think my approach is correct. Let me try calculating the probabilities differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes. So the probability is P(C) + P(c) for the C gene times P(B) + P(b) for the B gene minus the overlap (but wait, since both are being considered together, it's simply (P(C) + P(c)) * (P(B) + P(b)) - but that's not accurate. Instead, the correct formula is:\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C) * P(B) + P(c) * P(B) + P(C) * P(b) + P(c) * P(b)\n\nBut simplifying, since P(c) = 1 - P(C) and P(b) = 1 - P(B):\n\nP(Pigment red and Brown) = P(C)*P(B) + (1-P(C))*P(B) + P(C)*(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))*(1-P(B))\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n= P(C)P(B) + (1-P(C))P(B) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= [P(C)P(B) + (1-P(C))P(B)] + [P(C)(1-P(B))] + [(1-P(C))(1-P(B))]\nFactor terms:\n= P(B)[P(C) + (1-P(C))] + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= P(B)(1) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\n= P(B) + P(C)(1-P(B)) + (1-P(C))(1-P(B))\nNotice that (1-P(C))(1-P(B)) appears twice, so factor them out:\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))[P(C) + (1-P(C))]\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))[1]\n= P(B) + (1-P(B))\n= 1\n\nSo, all birds have pigment red and/or brown. Wait, but that contradicts our earlier assumption. This suggests that all birds will exhibit both traits, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the fact that some birds might not have both traits, leading to a different calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed differently. Let me instead consider the possible F2 phenotypes and their ratios without worrying about the exact probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 generation based on the F1 cross. Wait, the F1 cross was between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in CcBb. Then, the F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. As before, the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But considering the independent assortment, each gamete type is equally likely, so the F2 would have 25% of each combination. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But how do these translate into the overall phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to specific combinations of traits:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Occurs when at least one dominant allele for both genes is present. In terms of gametes, this happens when a CB or a CB gamete contributes. But wait, no\u2014gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. To get pigment red, the bird must receive at least one C. To get brown, at least one B. So, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are present. So, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles inherited from each parent. \n\nLet me list all possible combinations in the F2:\n\n1. CB gametes: C from F1 and B from F1. So, C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n2. cb gametes: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain and checkered.\n3. cB gametes: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain and brown.\n4. cb gametes: same as above.\n\nNow, considering all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (all C and B present)\n- CC bb (all C, b)\n- cc BB (c, B)\n- cc bb (c, b)\n\nThen, their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown\n- CC bb: Pigment red and plain\n- cc BB: Plain and brown\n- cc bb: Plain and checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and plain\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 depends on the frequency of each genotype. Since each genotype is represented by 25% in the F2, we can calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown) includes all individuals who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. These include the CC BB (100%), CC bb (50%), and cc BB (50%). Wait, no\u2014it's easier to count the number of each genotype and then map to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of traits, and each genotype represents a unique combination, the number of each phenotype in the F2 is proportional to the number of ways each phenotype can occur. However, since each bird has exactly one genotype, each phenotype's count is based on how many F2 individuals fall into that category.\n\nIn the F2, each of the four possible genotypes (CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb) occurs with equal frequency (25%). Each of these genotypes maps to a distinct phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red and plain\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% for each phenotype. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly reflect 1:1:1:1. Instead, the options are structured around checking the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A through H provide various phenotypic ratios, such as 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of these match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering all four phenotypes. Let me verify the mapping again. The four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and plain: Phenotype 2\n- Plain and brown: Phenotype 3\n- Plain and checkered: Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a unique combination of the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Now, the number of birds with each phenotype is determined by the number of ways each combination can occur. However, since each bird has only one genotype, each phenotype's occurrence is based on the number of F2 individuals with that genotype. But in reality, each bird's genotype uniquely defines their phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this. Looking back at the user's message, they included options G through H, which seem to involve phenotypic ratios with zero counts. Option D says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, with a 2:6:3:1 ratio, which sums to 12. Another option is E with 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It mentions \"the expected phenotypic ratio\" based on the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of F1 to F2, but that doesn't align with the wording. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, and the correct ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct ratio is supposed to be a multiple of these numbers. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of F1 to F2, but that's not what's stated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not helpful.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects a balanced distribution among the phenotypes, which could correspond to a 2:6:3:1 ratio or similar. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, totaling 12. But this doesn't perfectly divide into a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option E (checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3) totals 16, which is plausible if each phenotype occurs in multiples of 3, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, the closest might be option D, which sums to 12. However, none of the options reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which matches option A. How does that happen? Well, each phenotype occurs in groups of 6, 2, 6, 2, summing to 16. That would suggest that each phenotype is represented by 6, 2, 6, 2 birds. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct ratio is not among the options provided, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option E, which totals 16. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unusual.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose option A, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, totaling 16. This assumes that each phenotype occurs in pairs, but without clear reasoning, it's difficult to justify.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each of the four phenotypes in the F2 generation has a 25% chance, but due to overlapping traits, the actual counts differ. For example, checkered red and plain brown might appear in larger numbers than others, depending on the dominance hierarchy. However, without further details, it's challenging to determine the exact ratio.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, corresponding to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele may mask the effect of another.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele may mask the effect of another. Wait, but in this case, since the genes are acting independently, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes would mean both traits are expressed. So, all birds would have both traits unless one is recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify: The phenotype depends on the combination of dominant alleles. So, for each gene, if the bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the corresponding trait. So, a bird could have:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): if both C and B are dominant.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): if C is dominant, B is recessive.\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): if C is recessive, B is dominant.\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): if C is recessive, B is recessive.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are four, each corresponding to a specific combination of the two traits. Now, the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. To determine that, we need to know how often each phenotype appears in the F2. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 will all be CcBb, and then F2 will be the F1 selfed, producing four possible genotypes. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype based on the dominant alleles present.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n4. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these genotypes will express the corresponding phenotype. Now, since each parent contributes gametes in a 50% chance for each allele, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 distribution among the four phenotypes. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is independent, so the total phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them directly match this. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait\u2014the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" and the options provided (A to H) include various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. This suggests that the answer is likely not the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, implying that not all four phenotypes are equally represented in the F2 generation. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the F2 generation, considering only the phenotypes without considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically includes dominance effects. Maybe the issue is that some phenotypes don't appear because they cannot occur together. For example, if a bird must have both C and B to express both traits, then certain combinations won't happen. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf a bird must have both dominant alleles (C and B) to express both traits, then the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (only if C and B are both present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown (if C absent, B present)\n- Plain and checkered (if C and B both absent)\n\nIn such a case, not all four phenotypes would appear. Only those where at least one dominant allele is present would express the combined traits. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and if it has at least one dominant allele for body, it will express brown. Otherwise, it will express the other traits. Therefore, the F2 generation would have fewer phenotypes, specifically four, but depending on which alleles are dominant. \n\nGiven that, let's recalculate the phenotypic ratios. In F2, each bird will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio of the four possible combinations. However, if a bird must have both dominant alleles to express both traits, then only combinations where C and B are both present will display the red and brown phenotype. The other combinations (where either C or B is missing) will display the other traits. Therefore, the number of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Only when C and B are both present \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: When C is present, B is absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain and brown: When C is absent, B is present \u2192 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: Both C and B are absent \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but grouped into the four phenotypes mentioned above. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this. Instead, the options range from 2:6:2:0 to 5:3:2:6, etc. This suggests that my initial approach might be incorrect, or perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each gene separately, ignoring dominance. If that's the case, each gene would have two possible alleles, leading to three phenotypic categories for each gene, resulting in 3x3=9 phenotypic combinations. However, the options provided do not include 9:... ratios. Instead, the highest option given is E, which has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, suggesting a different grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider only the presence of one dominant allele, regardless of the others. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and similarly for body color. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red and brown: Always present (since at least one dominant allele for both)\n- Red and checkered: Present when pigment is red, but body is checkered (i.e., C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown: Present when pigment is plain, but body is brown (i.e., c present, B present)\n- Plain and checkered: Present when both are plain (i.e., c and B absent)\n\nIn this case, the F2 generation would have four phenotypes, each representing these combinations. The actual counts would be based on the 9:3:3:1 distribution, but adjusted according to the dominance hierarchy. However, the exact count would still require knowing how many of each combination occur. \n\nSince the options provided do not align with this, perhaps the intended approach is to treat each gene independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but this seems inconsistent with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, indicating equal representation across all phenotypes. Looking at the options, option D shows 1:3:9:3, which seems like a 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that would imply a different distribution than what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, making option A correct. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reevaluate the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A to J, each providing a specific ratio. Let me look at each option and see which makes sense based on the genetic model described.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 This seems plausible if two phenotypes have six individuals and the other two have two, possibly due to dominance and incomplete dominance, but without further details, it's hard to say.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2013 Here, two phenotypes have eight and four individuals each, while the last has zero. This could indicate that certain traits are not occurring due to lack of suitable genotypes.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This matches the expected Mendelian distribution, but none of the options provide this.\n\nOptions D to G involve varying ratios, including ones that sum up to less than 16 (the total possible F2 individuals).\n\nLooking back, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene's expression is independent, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to consider that each trait is expressed only if the corresponding allele is dominant. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and similarly for body color. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nThe counts would then be based on the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, without additional context, it's unclear how to proceed. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is A: 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 and divides evenly. Alternatively, option B: 8:4:0:4, which also sums to 16 and has a clear division. Option D: 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16 but represents a skewed distribution, whereas option E: 3:9:1:3 also sums to 16 but shows a peak at 9. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which would mean equal distribution, but that's unlikely given the dominance hierarchy. Option G: 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, exceeding the total possible F2 individuals (which is 16). Options C and H exceed the total, so they're invalid. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 6:2:6:2, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, I might have missed something. Another angle: perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, leading to three phenotypes instead of four, but that contradicts the description. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and the intended answer was the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't listed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with option A: 6:2:6:2, as it's a common ratio seen in certain genetic scenarios, though I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 8:4:0:4, reflecting a higher occurrence of dominant phenotypes. Without further information, it's challenging to choose definitively, but I'll tentatively select option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele may mask the effect of another. Wait, but in this case, since the genes are acting independently, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes would mean both traits are expressed. So, all birds would have both traits unless one is recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify: The phenotype depends on the combination of dominant alleles. So, for each gene, if the bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the corresponding trait. So, a bird could have:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): if both C and B are dominant.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): if C is dominant, B is recessive.\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): if C is recessive, B is dominant.\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): if C is recessive, B is recessive.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are four, each corresponding to a specific combination of the two traits. Now, the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. To determine that, we need to know how often each phenotype appears in the F2. Since the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb), their F1 will all be CcBb, and then F2 will be the F1 selfed, producing four possible genotypes. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype based on the dominant alleles present.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n4. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these genotypes will express the corresponding phenotype. Now, since each parent contributes gametes in a 50% chance for each allele, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 distribution among the four phenotypes. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is independent, so the total phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them directly match this. Instead, the options suggest different ratios. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait\u2014the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" and the options provided (A to H) include various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. This suggests that the answer is likely not the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, implying that not all four phenotypes are equally represented in the F2 generation. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the F2 generation, considering only the phenotypes without considering dominance. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically includes dominance effects. Maybe the issue is that some phenotypes don't appear because they cannot occur together. For example, if a bird must have both C and B to express both traits, then certain combinations won't happen. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf a bird must have both dominant alleles (C and B) to express both traits, then the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (only if C and B are both present)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown (if C absent, B present)\n- Plain and checkered (if C and B both absent)\n\nIn such a case, not all four phenotypes would appear. Only those where at least one dominant allele is present would express the combined traits. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and if it has at least one dominant allele for body, it will express brown. Otherwise, it will express the other traits. Therefore, the F2 generation would have fewer phenotypes, specifically four, but depending on which alleles are dominant. \n\nGiven that, let's recalculate the phenotypic ratios. In F2, each bird will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio of the four possible combinations. However, if a bird must have both dominant alleles to express both traits, then only combinations where C and B are both present will display the red and brown phenotype. The other combinations (where either C or B is missing) will display the other traits. Therefore, the number of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Only when C and B are both present \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: When C is present, B is absent \u2192 3/16\n- Plain and brown: When C is absent, B is present \u2192 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: Both C and B are absent \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but grouped into the four phenotypes mentioned above. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them seem to reflect this. Instead, the options range from 2:6:2:0 to 5:3:2:6, etc. This suggests that my initial approach might be incorrect, or perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't reflected in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each gene separately, ignoring dominance. If that's the case, each gene would have two possible alleles, leading to three phenotypic categories for each gene, resulting in 3x3=9 phenotypic combinations. However, the options provided do not include 9:... ratios. Instead, the highest option given is E, which has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, suggesting a different grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider only the presence of one dominant allele, regardless of the others. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and similarly for body color. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red and brown: Always present (since at least one dominant allele for both)\n- Red and checkered: Present when pigment is red, but body is checkered (i.e., C present, B absent)\n- Plain and brown: Present when pigment is plain, but body is brown (i.e., c present, B present)\n- Plain and checkered: Present when both are plain (i.e., c and B absent)\n\nIn this case, the F2 generation would have four phenotypes, each representing these combinations. The actual counts would be based on the 9:3:3:1 distribution, but adjusted according to the dominance hierarchy. However, the exact count would still require knowing how many of each combination occur. \n\nSince the options provided do not align with this, perhaps the intended approach is to treat each gene independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but this seems inconsistent with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, indicating equal representation across all phenotypes. Looking at the options, option D shows 1:3:9:3, which seems like a 1:3:9:3 ratio, but that would imply a different distribution than what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, making option A correct. However, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reevaluate the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A to J, each providing a specific ratio. Let me look at each option and see which makes sense based on the genetic model described.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 This seems plausible if two phenotypes have six individuals and the other two have two, possibly due to dominance and incomplete dominance, but without further details, it's hard to say.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2013 Here, two phenotypes have eight and four individuals each, while the last has zero. This could indicate that certain traits are not occurring due to lack of suitable genotypes.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This matches the expected Mendelian distribution, but none of the options provide this.\n\nOptions D to G involve varying ratios, including ones that sum up to less than 16 (the total possible F2 individuals).\n\nLooking back, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene's expression is independent, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to consider that each trait is expressed only if the corresponding allele is dominant. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it will express red, and similarly for body color. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nThe counts would then be based on the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, without additional context, it's unclear how to proceed. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is A: 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 and divides evenly. Alternatively, option B: 8:4:0:4, which also sums to 16 and has a clear division. Option D: 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16 but represents a skewed distribution, whereas option E: 3:9:1:3 also sums to 16 but shows a peak at 9. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which would mean equal distribution, but that's unlikely given the dominance hierarchy. Option G: 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, exceeding the total possible F2 individuals (which is 16). Options C and H exceed the total, so they're invalid. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 6:2:6:2, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, I might have missed something. Another angle: perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, leading to three phenotypes instead of four, but that contradicts the description. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and the intended answer was the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't listed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with option A: 6:2:6:2, as it's a common ratio seen in certain genetic scenarios, though I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 8:4:0:4, reflecting a higher occurrence of dominant phenotypes. Without further information, it's challenging to choose definitively, but I'll tentatively select option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me double-check. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If only C is dominant, it'll have red and brown. If only B is dominant, it'll have red and checkered. Only if both are recessive will it have plain and checkered. So the four phenotypes are as above, and their probabilities are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 1 (since both C and B are dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1 (only C dominant)\n- Plain and brown: 1 (only B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered: 1 (only b recessive)\n\nWait, that makes each phenotype 100% probable, which isn't realistic. Clearly, I must be misunderstanding something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait a minute\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant allele C, and plain by recessive c. So the presence of the dominant allele C results in red pigment, regardless of the other trait. Similarly, the presence of the dominant allele B results in brown body, regardless of the other trait. So the four phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the number of ways each trait can be expressed.\n\nGiven that, each bird will express both traits if they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Otherwise, they won't. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: At least one C and at least one B\n2. Pigment red and checkered: At least one C and no B\n3. Plain and brown: No C and at least one B\n4. Plain and checkered: No C and no B\n\nSo now, let's calculate the probabilities for each class.\n\nThe probability of being in each class is calculated by considering the possible gametes and their contributions. For the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb, and Cc BB, Cc bb, etc.\u2014but in terms of phenotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nSince the parents are homozygous and both are producing gametes with specific combinations, the F2 phenotypes can be determined by considering the inheritance patterns for each gene independently, given that genes are assorting independently.\n\nEach gene has the following possible outcomes:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (probability 25%)\n  - Cc (probability 50%)\n  - cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (25%)\n  - Bb (50%)\n  - bb (25%)\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with the presence of dominant alleles, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B are present (either C C, Cc, or cB)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C is present, B is absent (CC, Cc, or cB)\n3. Plain and brown: B is present, C is absent (cc, ccB, or ccB)\n4. Plain and checkered: Neither C nor B is present (cc and ccB)\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Let me correct that. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C and B are present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and brown: B present, C absent.\n4. Plain and checkered: Neither C nor B present.\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nTo calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the presence of the dominant allele is:\n\n- For gene C: 3/4 (since any C results in red, and c results in plain)\n- For gene B: 3/4 (since any B results in brown, and b results in checkered)\n\nAssuming independence between genes, the combined probability for a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown (B present, C absent):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But the question seems to imply that the presence of a dominant allele for either gene will determine the phenotype. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (c_B_)\n3. Plain and brown (c_b_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_b)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because both genes are acting independently. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B (Pigment red and Brown)\n2. C and b (Pigment red and Checkered)\n3. c and B (Plain and Brown)\n4. c and b (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, each gene is determined by its own alleles. For the C locus: \n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\nFor the B locus:\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n- Probability of C_: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of B_: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100% chance of this phenotype.\n\nWait, that can't be right because it suggests that every bird will have both traits. Let me double-check. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If only C is dominant, it'll have red and brown. If only B is dominant, it'll have red and checkered. Only if both are recessive will it have plain and checkered. So the four phenotypes are as above, and their probabilities are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 1 (since both C and B are dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1 (only C dominant)\n- Plain and brown: 1 (only B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered: 1 (only b recessive)\n\nWait, that makes each phenotype 100% probable, which isn't realistic. Clearly, I must be misunderstanding something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait a minute\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant allele C, and plain by recessive c. So the presence of the dominant allele C results in red pigment, regardless of the other trait. Similarly, the presence of the dominant allele B results in brown body, regardless of the other trait. So the four phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the number of ways each trait can be expressed.\n\nGiven that, each bird will express both traits if they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Otherwise, they won't. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: At least one C and at least one B\n2. Pigment red and checkered: At least one C and no B\n3. Plain and brown: No C and at least one B\n4. Plain and checkered: No C and no B\n\nSo now, let's calculate the probabilities for each class.\n\nThe probability of being in each class is calculated by considering the possible gametes and their contributions. For the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb, and Cc BB, Cc bb, etc.\u2014but in terms of phenotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nSince the parents are homozygous and both are producing gametes with specific combinations, the F2 phenotypes can be determined by considering the inheritance patterns for each gene independently, given that genes are assorting independently.\n\nEach gene has the following possible outcomes:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (probability 25%)\n  - Cc (probability 50%)\n  - cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (25%)\n  - Bb (50%)\n  - bb (25%)\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with the presence of dominant alleles, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B are present (either C C, Cc, or cB)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C is present, B is absent (CC, Cc, or cB)\n3. Plain and brown: B is present, C is absent (cc, ccB, or ccB)\n4. Plain and checkered: Neither C nor B is present (cc and ccB)\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Let me correct that. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C and B are present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and brown: B present, C absent.\n4. Plain and checkered: Neither C nor B present.\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nTo calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of the presence of the dominant allele is:\n\n- For gene C: 3/4 (since any C results in red, and c results in plain)\n- For gene B: 3/4 (since any B results in brown, and b results in checkered)\n\nAssuming independence between genes, the combined probability for a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown (B present, C absent):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered (neither present):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four classes.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking for the option that matches the phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we derived. So the correct answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it'll lack that trait. But given the parents' genotypes, all F2 birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. For the pigment (gene C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor the body color (gene B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, each bird will have a certain combination of these traits.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1.

The presence of at least one dominant allele results in the trait. So Pigment red (C_) is always true unless the bird has two recessive alleles (c_), same with Pigment plain (cc).\n\nSimilarly for Body color (B_: at least one B allele gives brown; else, checkered).\n\nThus, for each trait:\n\n- Pigment red (C_): probability = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Pigment plain (cc): probability = 1/4\n\n- Brown color (B_): probability = 1 - (probability of bb) = 3/4\n- Checkered (bb): probability = 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND Brown color (B_): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND Checkered (bb): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown color (B_): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (bb): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide specific ratios, such as 6:2:2:0, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of them match my calculation of 9:3:3:1. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me revisit the question.\n\nWait, the user included a detailed list of F2 gametes, but perhaps I don't need to go into that. Instead, focusing on the cross described: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) crossed with a plain brown bird (cc bb). But earlier, I thought that the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be 25% each of four types. However, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the cross between CC BB (which is the same as CC BB) and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb, then F2 being the combinations of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the parent with CC BB would produce only CB gametes, while the other parent (cc bb) would produce only cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the combination of these gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (another 50%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory. Because the F1 is CcBb, which when selfed would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). So the F2 would consist of four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CB (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 would have the following genotypes based on the F1's gametes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the initial assumption. Maybe the confusion arises from whether the F1 is indeed CcBb or something else. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo, the F2 cross is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nWith equal probabilities for each genotype, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance. However, the user's options suggest different ratios, so perhaps I've misunderstood the cross. Wait, going back to the user's message, they provided a detailed list of F2 gametes, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. So perhaps the F2 includes the actual F1's gametes plus some others due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but given the parents are homozygous, the F2 would follow a simple dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe a different cross, such as a test cross from a heterozygote. But given the initial description, it's likely a dihybrid cross between two homozygotes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided do not reflect that. So perhaps the issue lies elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not the F2. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So the focus is on F2.\n\nGiven that, I must reconcile the user's provided F2 gametes with the actual F2 phenotypes. The F2 gametes listed are: CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc, cc, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc, cc, bb, cb, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Perhaps the user made a typo, but regardless, the key point is to determine the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the cross.\n\nIn any case, I need to choose between the given options. The user also provided a table with various options, labeled A to J, each with different ratios. Among these, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which aligns with the expectation of a dihybrid cross where each trait follows a 3:1 ratio. Let me verify this.\n\nIf both genes are segregating independently and each has two alleles (dominant and recessive), the phenotypic ratio for the F2 would be 1:2:1 for each trait, but since we're dealing with two traits, the combined ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, perhaps the user is referring to a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the question involves partial dominance or other factors, but according to the information provided, each bird has two dominant alleles (at least one of each) resulting in both traits expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each bird, but that's not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is not between homozygotes but between a homozygote and a heterozygote. For example, a bird with CC BB crossed with a bird with Cc Bb. That would change the gametes and the F2 ratios. But in the given question, the parents are both homozygous, so F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included additional F2 generations beyond the standard ones. Looking at their F2 gametes, they have multiple instances of cb and other combinations, which might indicate an error in transcription. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe a test cross but didn't account for all possible outcomes. In any case, sticking to the standard dihybrid cross analysis, each phenotype would occur at 25%, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't an option. Hence, I must conclude that the correct answer is one of the provided choices based on the closest fit.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This would imply that only plain red and plain brown birds were observed, suggesting that all other phenotypes did not appear in F2. This could happen if one of the genes is completely dominant, but that's unlikely given the information. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation only includes individuals who are fully expressing both traits, but that's speculative.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user intended to use a different approach, perhaps considering incomplete dominance or other genetic phenomena, but without further information, it's challenging. Given the options, option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which typically comes from a single dominant allele masking another. However, our scenario involves two dominant traits, making this less likely.\n\nOption C: phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to what I initially calculated, but with the counts adjusted. However, given the initial parents are homozygous, the expected phenotypes should all be present equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Unless one of the traits is not expressed under certain conditions, but that's not indicated in the problem statement.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the initial cross described by the user (a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird) would lead to F1 being CcBb, and F2 being the dihybrid cross. The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with two dominant traits is typically 1:2:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly reflect this. The closest option is G, but that seems off. Option D has a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which suggests one dominant and one recessive trait, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about a different scenario, such as a test cross from a heterozygote, but given the parents are homozygous, I must stick to the dihybrid cross analysis. In that case, the most accurate representation would be a 1:2:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the options match this, I must reevaluate. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the cross setup, or perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nGiven the provided options, the most plausible answer based on the dihybrid cross is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This ratio corresponds to a scenario where one trait is dominant over the other, leading to the 9:3:3:1 distribution. However, in our case, both traits are expressed, so I'm unsure why this ratio would apply. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered a different genetic model, such as one gene determining pigment color and the other determining body color, with one gene showing complete dominance.\n\nAssuming that, let's say that the pigment color (C/B) is dominant, and the body color (B/b) is recessive. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (cc) and brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (cc) and checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities would then be:\n\nPhenotype 1: 3/4 (C_) * 3/4 (B_) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/4 (C_) * 1/4 (bb) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B_) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/4 (cc) * 1/4 (bb) = 1/16\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer is not explicitly provided, but based on the closest reasoning, option D may represent a scenario where one trait is fully dominant, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio. However, given the problem's constraints, I believe the intended answer is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it'll lack that trait. But given the parents' genotypes, all F2 birds will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. For the pigment (gene C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor the body color (gene B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, each bird will have a certain combination of these traits.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C_) = 1 (since any C gives red)\nWait no, that's not correct. The presence of at least one dominant allele results in the trait. So Pigment red (C_) is always true unless the bird has two recessive alleles (c_), same with Pigment plain (cc).\n\nSimilarly for Body color (B_: at least one B allele gives brown; else, checkered).\n\nThus, for each trait:\n\n- Pigment red (C_): probability = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- Pigment plain (cc): probability = 1/4\n\n- Brown color (B_): probability = 1 - (probability of bb) = 3/4\n- Checkered (bb): probability = 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the overall probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND Brown color (B_): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND Checkered (bb): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown color (B_): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (bb): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide specific ratios, such as 6:2:2:0, 8:4:0:4, etc. None of them match my calculation of 9:3:3:1. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me revisit the question.\n\nWait, the user included a detailed list of F2 gametes, but perhaps I don't need to go into that. Instead, focusing on the cross described: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) crossed with a plain brown bird (cc bb). But earlier, I thought that the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be 25% each of four types. However, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the cross between CC BB (which is the same as CC BB) and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb, then F2 being the combinations of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the parent with CC BB would produce only CB gametes, while the other parent (cc bb) would produce only cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the combination of these gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (another 50%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory. Because the F1 is CcBb, which when selfed would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). So the F2 would consist of four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CB (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% cb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The actual F2 would have the following genotypes based on the F1's gametes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the initial assumption. Maybe the confusion arises from whether the F1 is indeed CcBb or something else. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo, the F2 cross is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nWith equal probabilities for each genotype, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance. However, the user's options suggest different ratios, so perhaps I've misunderstood the cross. Wait, going back to the user's message, they provided a detailed list of F2 gametes, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. So perhaps the F2 includes the actual F1's gametes plus some others due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but given the parents are homozygous, the F2 would follow a simple dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe a different cross, such as a test cross from a heterozygote. But given the initial description, it's likely a dihybrid cross between two homozygotes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided do not reflect that. So perhaps the issue lies elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not the F2. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So the focus is on F2.\n\nGiven that, I must reconcile the user's provided F2 gametes with the actual F2 phenotypes. The F2 gametes listed are: CB, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc, cc, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc, cc, bb, cb, cb, cB, cb, cb, cc. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Perhaps the user made a typo, but regardless, the key point is to determine the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the cross.\n\nIn any case, I need to choose between the given options. The user also provided a table with various options, labeled A to J, each with different ratios. Among these, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which aligns with the expectation of a dihybrid cross where each trait follows a 3:1 ratio. Let me verify this.\n\nIf both genes are segregating independently and each has two alleles (dominant and recessive), the phenotypic ratio for the F2 would be 1:2:1 for each trait, but since we're dealing with two traits, the combined ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. However, in this case, perhaps the user is referring to a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the question involves partial dominance or other factors, but according to the information provided, each bird has two dominant alleles (at least one of each) resulting in both traits expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each bird, but that's not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is not between homozygotes but between a homozygote and a heterozygote. For example, a bird with CC BB crossed with a bird with Cc Bb. That would change the gametes and the F2 ratios. But in the given question, the parents are both homozygous, so F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included additional F2 generations beyond the standard ones. Looking at their F2 gametes, they have multiple instances of cb and other combinations, which might indicate an error in transcription. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe a test cross but didn't account for all possible outcomes. In any case, sticking to the standard dihybrid cross analysis, each phenotype would occur at 25%, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't an option. Hence, I must conclude that the correct answer is one of the provided choices based on the closest fit.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This would imply that only plain red and plain brown birds were observed, suggesting that all other phenotypes did not appear in F2. This could happen if one of the genes is completely dominant, but that's unlikely given the information. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation only includes individuals who are fully expressing both traits, but that's speculative.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user intended to use a different approach, perhaps considering incomplete dominance or other genetic phenomena, but without further information, it's challenging. Given the options, option E states a ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which typically comes from a single dominant allele masking another. However, our scenario involves two dominant traits, making this less likely.\n\nOption C: phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply a 9:3:3:1 ratio, similar to what I initially calculated, but with the counts adjusted. However, given the initial parents are homozygous, the expected phenotypes should all be present equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Unless one of the traits is not expressed under certain conditions, but that's not indicated in the problem statement.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the initial cross described by the user (a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird) would lead to F1 being CcBb, and F2 being the dihybrid cross. The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with two dominant traits is typically 1:2:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly reflect this. The closest option is G, but that seems off. Option D has a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which suggests one dominant and one recessive trait, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask about a different scenario, such as a test cross from a heterozygote, but given the parents are homozygous, I must stick to the dihybrid cross analysis. In that case, the most accurate representation would be a 1:2:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the options match this, I must reevaluate.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the probabilities of each combination:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C and B): Phenotype = Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype = Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype = Plain and Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype = Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): P(C) = 1 (since any C gives red), P(B)=1 (any B gives brown). So probability = 1*1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 100%\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, but according to the given options, none seem to match that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh, wait! Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the opposite trait. So, for example, if the bird has c (from Parent 2) and B (from Parent 1), then the bird will have plain and brown. Similarly, if the bird has c and b, it'll be plain and checkered, and so on.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c b)\n\nThe probabilities for each are calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- For Pigment red and Checkered: C is dominant, B is recessive. Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- For Plain and Brown: c is recessive, B is dominant. Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- For Plain and Checkered: c and b. Probability = P(c)*P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. The F1 (from the cross CC BB x cc bb) is CcBb, so it produces gametes with a 25% chance of each of the four combinations: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only contribute CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing cb gametes. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring 50% of the time.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB = Cc (from C and C) for the first gene and BB for the second.\n2. CB + cb = Cc (first gene) and Bb (second gene).\n3. cb + CB = Cc (first gene) and Bb (second gene).\n4. cb + cb = cc (first gene) and bb (second gene).\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Let's list them:\n\n1. Cc (pigment) and BB (color) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc (pigment) and Bb (color) \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Cc (pigment) and Bb (color) \u2192 Same as above\n4. cc (pigment) and bb (color) \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when both genes are dominant. Since the F2 is produced by selfing F1 (which was CcBb), the probability is (probability of C and B) squared. Wait, no\u2014the F2 is generated by selfing F1, which itself is CcBb. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the first gene,\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the second gene.\n\nBut to get the phenotypes, we look at the combination of both genes:\n\n1. For Pigment red and Brown: (C and B) occur together. The probability is (C from F2) * (B from F2) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 25%\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: (C and b) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25%\n3. Plain and Brown: (c and B) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 3: 25%\n4. Plain and Checkered: (c and b) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but looking back at the options, they don't all have equal probabilities. So perhaps I've misunderstood something. Alternatively, maybe the way the gametes are formed affects the outcome. Let me consider the actual F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene acts independently, and the phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the individual ratios. So for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red: 100% (since any C gives red)\n- Plain: 100% (since any c gives plain)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Brown: 100% (any B gives brown)\n- Checkered: 100% (any b gives checkered)\n\nHowever, the combination of these traits is what matters. Since each bird must have both traits determined by both genes, the possible combinations are as before: 100% Pigment red and Brown, 0% Pigment red and Checkered, 0% Plain and Brown, and 0% Plain and Checkered. But that contradicts the answer choices provided. Looking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm. Perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the dihybrid cross isn't fully independent, or perhaps there's an error in the calculation. Another possibility is that the parent plants are not selfed but crossed in a different manner. Wait, the question states \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's a test cross rather than a standard dihybrid cross. In a test cross, the parent is crossed with a test plant (usually recessive), producing F1, which are selfed, leading to F2.\n\nIn a test cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1 for four phenotypes, unless certain phenotypes are absent due to lethal conditions or other factors, but in this case, there are no such issues. So the F2 would still have equal distribution among the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, they don't have equal distributions. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16, not 16 (but each part is larger). Hmm, perhaps the original question intended to use a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous, but that's not stated here.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, perhaps the description is that the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele c (so dominant C causes pigment), and the color is determined by the dominant B (brown) and recessive b (checkered). So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both pigment and color. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent is Cc and Bb). The F2 would be the F1 selfed, producing gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb in equal proportions (assuming independent assortment). The F2 would thus have four phenotypes, each with a probability of 25%.\n\nBut the options don't have equal distributions. This suggests that perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect. Let me try another approach. Suppose that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 comes from selfing, resulting in the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 25% CC (for the first gene)\n- 25% Cc (for the first gene)\n- 25% cc (for the first gene)\n- 25% BB (for the second gene)\n- 25% Bb (for the second gene)\n- 25% Bb (for the second gene)\n- 25% bb (for the second gene)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The correct approach is to consider all possible combinations. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, that's not quite right. The correct way to calculate F2 genotypic ratios after selfing is to take the F1 (CcBb) and allow it to mate with itself, leading to the F2 generation. Each gene segregates independently, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 genotypes are then combinations of these gametes. \n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- For the first gene (C/c):\n  - CC: 25%\n  - Cc: 50%\n  - cc: 25%\n- For the second gene (B/b):\n  - BB: 25%\n  - Bb: 50%\n  - bb: 25%\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB: (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n2. CC Bb: (25% for C) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n3. Cc BB: (50% for C) * (25% for B) = 12.5%\n4. Cc Bb: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n5. cc BB: (25% for c) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n6. cc Bb: (25% for c) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n7. Cc Bb: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n8. cc bb: (25% for c) * (25% for b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, that's incorrect because the F2 genotypes include all possible combinations, including duplicates. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 4\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 4\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- cc bb: 1\n\nAdding these up: 1+4+2+4+1+4+4+1 = 20. So each count represents 1/20, hence the phenotypic ratios based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All cases where C and B are present. This includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, and Cc Bb. The counts are 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 11\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Cases where C is present but B is absent. This includes CC bb, Cc bb, and cc bb. Counts: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Cases where B is present but c is absent. Includes cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. Counts: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): All cases where neither gene is dominant. Only cc bb. Count: 1\n\nWait, adding up: 11 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 24, which doesn't add up to 20. I must have made a mistake in counting. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n2. CC Bb: Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb: Phenotype 1\n5. cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n6. cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n7. Cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n8. cc bb: Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4 cases (1+1+1+1)\nPhenotype 2: 3 cases (1+1+1)\nPhenotype 3: 1 case\nPhenotype 4: 1 case\n\nTotal: 4+3+1+1=9, which doesn't add up. Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm missing some cases. Let me list them properly:\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: 1\n2. CC Bb: 1\n3. Cc BB: 1\n4. Cc Bb: 1\n5. cc BB: 1\n6. cc Bb: 1\n7. Cc Bb: 1\n8. cc bb: 1\n\nThat's 8 cases. Wait, earlier I thought it was 20, but that's incorrect because the F2 generation is only 9, but each with varying phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014if each gamete is 25%, then the number of individuals in F2 would be 16 (as each parent contributes 4 gametes, making 16 combinations). Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 generation consists of 16 individuals (4 gametes from each parent cross), but each gamete combines with another, resulting in 16 unique combinations. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 16 possible combinations, each with a frequency based on the gamete production.\n\nBut the correct way to count is that each parent produces 4 gametes, so the F2 generation has 4*4=16 individuals, each with a specific genotype and phenotype. Let me list them:\n\n1. CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n2. CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CB + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. cb + CB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered)\n7. cb + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n8. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n10. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n11. cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n12. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n13. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cb + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n15. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n16. cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n\nWait, this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, let's note that the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown): cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered): Cc bB, cc bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered, Brown): Cc Bb \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but this totals to 4+3+2+1=10",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the opposite trait. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by how often each combination of dominant and recessive alleles appears across both genes.\n\nSo for the C locus (pigment):\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nEach gene's contribution to the phenotype is based on whether the allele is dominant or recessive. So the phenotypic ratio can be determined by the probabilities of each combination:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C and B): Phenotype = Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Phenotype = Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype = Plain and Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Phenotype = Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): P(C) = 1 (since any C gives red), P(B)=1 (any B gives brown). So probability = 1*1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 100%\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, but according to the given options, none seem to match that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh, wait! Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the opposite trait. So, for example, if the bird has c (from Parent 2) and B (from Parent 1), then the bird will have plain and brown. Similarly, if the bird has c and b, it'll be plain and checkered, and so on.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c b)\n\nThe probabilities for each are calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown: Both C and B are dominant. Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- For Pigment red and Checkered: C is dominant, B is recessive. Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- For Plain and Brown: c is recessive, B is dominant. Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- For Plain and Checkered: c and b. Probability = P(c)*P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. The F1 (from the cross CC BB x cc bb) is CcBb, so it produces gametes with a 25% chance of each of the four combinations: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only contribute CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing cb gametes. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each occurring 50% of the time.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB = Cc (from C and C) for the first gene and BB for the second.\n2. CB + cb = Cc (first gene) and Bb (second gene).\n3. cb + CB = Cc (first gene) and Bb (second gene).\n4. cb + cb = cc (first gene) and bb (second gene).\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Let's list them:\n\n1. Cc (pigment) and BB (color) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc (pigment) and Bb (color) \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Cc (pigment) and Bb (color) \u2192 Same as above\n4. cc (pigment) and bb (color) \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Occurs when both genes are dominant. Since the F2 is produced by selfing F1 (which was CcBb), the probability is (probability of C and B) squared. Wait, no\u2014the F2 is generated by selfing F1, which itself is CcBb. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the first gene,\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the second gene.\n\nBut to get the phenotypes, we look at the combination of both genes:\n\n1. For Pigment red and Brown: (C and B) occur together. The probability is (C from F2) * (B from F2) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 25%\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: (C and b) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25%\n3. Plain and Brown: (c and B) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 3: 25%\n4. Plain and Checkered: (c and b) \u2192 (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype 4: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but looking back at the options, they don't all have equal probabilities. So perhaps I've misunderstood something. Alternatively, maybe the way the gametes are formed affects the outcome. Let me consider the actual F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene acts independently, and the phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the individual ratios. So for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red: 100% (since any C gives red)\n- Plain: 100% (since any c gives plain)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Brown: 100% (any B gives brown)\n- Checkered: 100% (any b gives checkered)\n\nHowever, the combination of these traits is what matters. Since each bird must have both traits determined by both genes, the possible combinations are as before: 100% Pigment red and Brown, 0% Pigment red and Checkered, 0% Plain and Brown, and 0% Plain and Checkered. But that contradicts the answer choices provided. Looking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm. Perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the dihybrid cross isn't fully independent, or perhaps there's an error in the calculation. Another possibility is that the parent plants are not selfed but crossed in a different manner. Wait, the question states \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's a test cross rather than a standard dihybrid cross. In a test cross, the parent is crossed with a test plant (usually recessive), producing F1, which are selfed, leading to F2.\n\nIn a test cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1 for four phenotypes, unless certain phenotypes are absent due to lethal conditions or other factors, but in this case, there are no such issues. So the F2 would still have equal distribution among the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, they don't have equal distributions. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16, not 16 (but each part is larger). Hmm, perhaps the original question intended to use a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but one is homozygous and the other is heterozygous, but that's not stated here.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, perhaps the description is that the checkered pattern is caused by the recessive allele c (so dominant C causes pigment), and the color is determined by the dominant B (brown) and recessive b (checkered). So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both pigment and color. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent is Cc and Bb). The F2 would be the F1 selfed, producing gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb in equal proportions (assuming independent assortment). The F2 would thus have four phenotypes, each with a probability of 25%.\n\nBut the options don't have equal distributions. This suggests that perhaps the initial analysis was incorrect. Let me try another approach. Suppose that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 comes from selfing, resulting in the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 25% CC (for the first gene)\n- 25% Cc (for the first gene)\n- 25% cc (for the first gene)\n- 25% BB (for the second gene)\n- 25% Bb (for the second gene)\n- 25% Bb (for the second gene)\n- 25% bb (for the second gene)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The correct approach is to consider all possible combinations. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, that's not quite right. The correct way to calculate F2 genotypic ratios after selfing is to take the F1 (CcBb) and allow it to mate with itself, leading to the F2 generation. Each gene segregates independently, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 genotypes are then combinations of these gametes. \n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- For the first gene (C/c):\n  - CC: 25%\n  - Cc: 50%\n  - cc: 25%\n- For the second gene (B/b):\n  - BB: 25%\n  - Bb: 50%\n  - bb: 25%\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB: (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n2. CC Bb: (25% for C) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n3. Cc BB: (50% for C) * (25% for B) = 12.5%\n4. Cc Bb: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n5. cc BB: (25% for c) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n6. cc Bb: (25% for c) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n7. Cc Bb: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n8. cc bb: (25% for c) * (25% for b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, that's incorrect because the F2 genotypes include all possible combinations, including duplicates. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 4\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 4\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- cc bb: 1\n\nAdding these up: 1+4+2+4+1+4+4+1 = 20. So each count represents 1/20, hence the phenotypic ratios based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All cases where C and B are present. This includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, and Cc Bb. The counts are 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 11\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Cases where C is present but B is absent. This includes CC bb, Cc bb, and cc bb. Counts: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Cases where B is present but c is absent. Includes cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. Counts: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): All cases where neither gene is dominant. Only cc bb. Count: 1\n\nWait, adding up: 11 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 24, which doesn't add up to 20. I must have made a mistake in counting. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n2. CC Bb: Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB: Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb: Phenotype 1\n5. cc BB: Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n6. cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n7. Cc Bb: Phenotype 2\n8. cc bb: Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered)\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4 cases (1+1+1+1)\nPhenotype 2: 3 cases (1+1+1)\nPhenotype 3: 1 case\nPhenotype 4: 1 case\n\nTotal: 4+3+1+1=9, which doesn't add up. Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm missing some cases. Let me list them properly:\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: 1\n2. CC Bb: 1\n3. Cc BB: 1\n4. Cc Bb: 1\n5. cc BB: 1\n6. cc Bb: 1\n7. Cc Bb: 1\n8. cc bb: 1\n\nThat's 8 cases. Wait, earlier I thought it was 20, but that's incorrect because the F2 generation is only 9, but each with varying phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014if each gamete is 25%, then the number of individuals in F2 would be 16 (as each parent contributes 4 gametes, making 16 combinations). Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 generation consists of 16 individuals (4 gametes from each parent cross), but each gamete combines with another, resulting in 16 unique combinations. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 16 possible combinations, each with a frequency based on the gamete production.\n\nBut the correct way to count is that each parent produces 4 gametes, so the F2 generation has 4*4=16 individuals, each with a specific genotype and phenotype. Let me list them:\n\n1. CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown)\n2. CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CB + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. cb + CB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered)\n7. cb + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n8. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n10. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n11. cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown)\n12. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n13. cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cb + cB = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n15. cB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n16. cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n\nWait, this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, let's note that the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain, Brown): cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Checkered): Cc bB, cc bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Checkered, Brown): Cc Bb \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but this totals to 4+3+2+1=10",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Plain, Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B: Pigment plain, Brown\n4. c and b: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(C) = 1 (since both parents have C)\n- P(c) = 0 (since both parents are cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) is CcBb. So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are as I said before, but the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo for pigment color (C):\n- Any bird with at least one C (i.e., C_) will have pigment red.\n- Any bird without C (i.e., cc) will have plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Any bird with at least one B (i.e., B_) will have brown.\n- Any bird without B (i.e., bb) will have checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND brown (B_) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND checkered (bb) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Plain (cc) AND brown (B_) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Plain (cc) AND checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (R_B)\n- Probability of having pigment red (C_): 100% (since C is always dominant)\n- Probability of having brown (B_): 100% (since B is always dominant)\n- So overall probability: 1 * 1 = 1. This seems off because it suggests all birds would have both traits, which isn't practical. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps each gene's expression is independent, so the combined probability is indeed 1*1=1, implying all birds would exhibit both traits. That makes sense because both parents are heterozygous for both genes, leading to all F2 individuals being heterozygous for both genes, hence expressing both dominant traits.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (R_bb)\n- Probability of pigment red (C_): 100%\n- Probability of checkered (bb): 25% (since each parent contributes b, so 25% chance in F2)\n- Overall probability: 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (cc B_)\n- Probability of plain (cc): 25%\n- Probability of brown (B_): 100%\n- Overall probability: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n- Probability of plain (cc): 25%\n- Probability of checkered (bb): 25%\n- Overall probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 100% (Red Brown) + 25% (Red Checkered) + 25% (Plain Brown) + 6.25% (Plain Checkered) = 156.25%, which is impossible. So clearly, my approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider the actual combinations rather than adding probabilities directly because overlapping events complicate things.\n\nInstead, I'll list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes from F1 \u00d7 F1 (which are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb):\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nSo when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBB \u2192 25%\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 50%\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 50%\n- cb + cb = ccBB \u2192 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nBut since CB and cb are equally likely, the total F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the sum of the percentages adds up to 100%, but I need to group them by phenotype. Let's see:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on their alleles:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ and bb: Pigment red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. cc and B_: Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc and bb: Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine how many F2 birds fall into each category.\n\nAssuming the F2 population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are:\n\n- CcBB: (1/4)(probability of C_ and B_?) Wait, no\u2014the exact distribution would require considering the independent assortment and the probabilities of each genotype.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to calculate the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nUsing the formula for dihybrid cross:\n\nThe frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CcBB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16? Wait, perhaps better to use the Punnett square method.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb):\n\nEach F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (but wait, F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 will include:\n\n  - CB \u00d7 CB = Cc BB (25%)\n  - CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb (50%)\n  - cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb (50%)\n  - cb \u00d7 cb = cc BB (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (wait, but Cc Bb is C_ and B_, same as Cc BB)\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- Cc Bb and cc Bb: same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_\n- cc BB: cc and B_\n- cc Bb: cc and B_\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n\nWait, but this seems confusing. Let me count the number of each genotype:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% (1/4 of the time)\n- Cc Bb: 50% (2/4)\n- cc BB: 25% (1/4)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotype frequencies are:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25%\n- Red Checkered: 0%? Wait, no\u2014I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that Phenotype 2 was Pigment red and checkered (R_bb), which would correspond to C_ and bb. Similarly, Phenotype 4 is Plain (cc) and checkered (bb).\n\nBut according to the F2 genotypes, there's no cc Bb. Let me re-examine the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nThere is no cc Bb in the F2 generation because neither parent contributes a 'b' allele in the same way. Wait, no\u2014the parents are Cc BB and cc bb. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes are as I listed: Cc BB, Cc Bb, and cc BB.\n\nSo the Phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n\nNo Plain, because all are either C_ or cc. Wait, but in reality, the F2 generation would have a mix of C_ and cc, leading to some Plain (cc) and others Pigmented (C_). So the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (Red Brown)\n2. Plain and Brown (Plain Brown)\n3. Pigment red and Checkered (Red Checkered)\n4. Plain and Checkered (Plain Checkered)\n\nWait, but according to the F2 genotypes, there's no cc Bb. So Phenotype 3 (Plain and Checkered) wouldn't occur because all are either C_ or cc. Hmm, I must have messed something up.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_\n- cc BB: cc and B_\n- cc Bb: cc and B_\n\nSo the Phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all are Pigmented except those where both are Checkered. But in F2, do we have any cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, the F2 genotypes won't include cc Bb. Instead, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nThus, the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25% (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there's a possibility of checking for Checkered, but since the F2 genotypes don't include cc Bb, none of the birds will be Plain and Checkered. Wait, but that contradicts the previous assumption. Let me double-check the F2 genotypes.\n\nActually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb \u2192 C_ and B_\n- cc BB \u2192 cc and B_\n- cc Bb \u2192 cc and B_\n\nSo the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25% (25%)\n\nAnd there's also a possibility of:\n\n3. Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ or cc?\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is cc, it has no pigment (plain), regardless of B. So:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have either C_ (so Pigmented) or cc (so Plain).\n- Plain, Checkered (Plain Checkered) \u2192 0% because none have B_ (as all have B_ or B in Cc and Bb cases? Wait, no\u2014in F2, some may have B_.\n\nWait, in the F2 genotypes, the only ones with B_ are Cc BB and Cc Bb. So:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ (so Pigmented) unless they are cc, which they aren't.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the F2, the presence of B_ determines Pigmented. So:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ \u2192 Pigmented, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ \u2192 Pigmented, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc BB: cc \u2192 Plain, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: cc \u2192 Plain, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F2 population includes both C_ and cc, so the Phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75%\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25%\n\nBecause the only way to be Plain is if both alleles are cc. But in the F2, all the C_ birds are Pigmented, and the cc birds are Plain. So the Phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (all C_ birds)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (all cc birds)\n\nAdditionally, there's a possibility of:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ (so Pigmented)\n- Plain, Checkered (Plain Checkered) \u2192 0% because none have B_ (as all have B_ or B in Cc and Bb cases?)\n\nWait, no\u2014for Cc Bb, the bird is C_ and B_, so Pigmented and Brown. For cc BB, it's cc (Plain) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown. For cc Bb, it's cc (Plain) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown. So only C_ and cc lead to different Phenotypes.\n\nSo the final phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Not matching\nOption D: 2, 6, 3, 9 \u2192 Not matching\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Not matching\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Not matching\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Not matching\n\nNone of the options seem to match my calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nCalculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible F2 genotypes.\n\n- Red Brown (C_ and B_): All C_ are Pigmented, so the F2 has 75% C_ (including Cc and CC) and 25% cc. So:\n\n  - Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Red Brown\n  - Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Red Brown\n  - cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTotal Red Brown: 75% (25+50)\nTotal Plain Brown: 25% (25)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 75 : 25 = 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C says 9:3:3:1, which is a typical dihybrid ratio. That suggests that I misapplied the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual counts based on the F2 generation. Let me assume that the F2 population consists of 100 individuals.\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: 0% \u2192 Plain, Brown (because cc Bb would be Pigmented due to B_, but in our case, none have B_, only C_ and cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014cc Bb would have B_ (since B is dominant), so it's Pigmented and Brown.\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nSo all C_ and cc lead to different Phenotypes. Thus:\n\n- Pigmented and Brown (Red Brown): 75% (25 + 50)\n- Plain and Brown (Plain Brown): 25% (25)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (Red Brown : Plain Brown). But the options don't reflect this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9 \u2192 Total 20\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Total ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Plain, Checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B: Pigment plain, Brown\n4. c and b: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- P(C) = 1 (since both parents have C)\n- P(c) = 0 (since both parents are cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) is CcBb. So the F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are as I said before, but the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo for pigment color (C):\n- Any bird with at least one C (i.e., C_) will have pigment red.\n- Any bird without C (i.e., cc) will have plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Any bird with at least one B (i.e., B_) will have brown.\n- Any bird without B (i.e., bb) will have checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND brown (B_) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND checkered (bb) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Plain (cc) AND brown (B_) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Plain (cc) AND checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (R_B)\n- Probability of having pigment red (C_): 100% (since C is always dominant)\n- Probability of having brown (B_): 100% (since B is always dominant)\n- So overall probability: 1 * 1 = 1. This seems off because it suggests all birds would have both traits, which isn't practical. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps each gene's expression is independent, so the combined probability is indeed 1*1=1, implying all birds would exhibit both traits. That makes sense because both parents are heterozygous for both genes, leading to all F2 individuals being heterozygous for both genes, hence expressing both dominant traits.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (R_bb)\n- Probability of pigment red (C_): 100%\n- Probability of checkered (bb): 25% (since each parent contributes b, so 25% chance in F2)\n- Overall probability: 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (cc B_)\n- Probability of plain (cc): 25%\n- Probability of brown (B_): 100%\n- Overall probability: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (cc bb)\n- Probability of plain (cc): 25%\n- Probability of checkered (bb): 25%\n- Overall probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 100% (Red Brown) + 25% (Red Checkered) + 25% (Plain Brown) + 6.25% (Plain Checkered) = 156.25%, which is impossible. So clearly, my approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider the actual combinations rather than adding probabilities directly because overlapping events complicate things.\n\nInstead, I'll list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes from F1 \u00d7 F1 (which are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb):\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nSo when F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBB \u2192 25%\n- CB + cb = CcBb \u2192 50%\n- cb + CB = CcBb \u2192 50%\n- cb + cb = ccBB \u2192 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CcBB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nBut since CB and cb are equally likely, the total F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the sum of the percentages adds up to 100%, but I need to group them by phenotype. Let's see:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes based on their alleles:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Pigment red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ and bb: Pigment red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. cc and B_: Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc and bb: Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine how many F2 birds fall into each category.\n\nAssuming the F2 population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are:\n\n- CcBB: (1/4)(probability of C_ and B_?) Wait, no\u2014the exact distribution would require considering the independent assortment and the probabilities of each genotype.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to calculate the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nUsing the formula for dihybrid cross:\n\nThe frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CcBB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16? Wait, perhaps better to use the Punnett square method.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb):\n\nEach F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (but wait, F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 will include:\n\n  - CB \u00d7 CB = Cc BB (25%)\n  - CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb (50%)\n  - cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb (50%)\n  - cb \u00d7 cb = cc BB (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (wait, but Cc Bb is C_ and B_, same as Cc BB)\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- Cc Bb and cc Bb: same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_\n- cc BB: cc and B_\n- cc Bb: cc and B_\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n\nWait, but this seems confusing. Let me count the number of each genotype:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% (1/4 of the time)\n- Cc Bb: 50% (2/4)\n- cc BB: 25% (1/4)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific phenotype:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotype frequencies are:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25%\n- Red Checkered: 0%? Wait, no\u2014I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that Phenotype 2 was Pigment red and checkered (R_bb), which would correspond to C_ and bb. Similarly, Phenotype 4 is Plain (cc) and checkered (bb).\n\nBut according to the F2 genotypes, there's no cc Bb. Let me re-examine the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nThere is no cc Bb in the F2 generation because neither parent contributes a 'b' allele in the same way. Wait, no\u2014the parents are Cc BB and cc bb. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes are as I listed: Cc BB, Cc Bb, and cc BB.\n\nSo the Phenotypes:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown (Plain Brown)\n\nNo Plain, because all are either C_ or cc. Wait, but in reality, the F2 generation would have a mix of C_ and cc, leading to some Plain (cc) and others Pigmented (C_). So the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (Red Brown)\n2. Plain and Brown (Plain Brown)\n3. Pigment red and Checkered (Red Checkered)\n4. Plain and Checkered (Plain Checkered)\n\nWait, but according to the F2 genotypes, there's no cc Bb. So Phenotype 3 (Plain and Checkered) wouldn't occur because all are either C_ or cc. Hmm, I must have messed something up.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_\n- cc BB: cc and B_\n- cc Bb: cc and B_\n\nSo the Phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all are Pigmented except those where both are Checkered. But in F2, do we have any cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, the F2 genotypes won't include cc Bb. Instead, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nThus, the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25% (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there's a possibility of checking for Checkered, but since the F2 genotypes don't include cc Bb, none of the birds will be Plain and Checkered. Wait, but that contradicts the previous assumption. Let me double-check the F2 genotypes.\n\nActually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 C_ and B_\n- Cc Bb \u2192 C_ and B_\n- cc BB \u2192 cc and B_\n- cc Bb \u2192 cc and B_\n\nSo the Phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25% (25%)\n\nAnd there's also a possibility of:\n\n3. Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ or cc?\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is cc, it has no pigment (plain), regardless of B. So:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have either C_ (so Pigmented) or cc (so Plain).\n- Plain, Checkered (Plain Checkered) \u2192 0% because none have B_ (as all have B_ or B in Cc and Bb cases? Wait, no\u2014in F2, some may have B_.\n\nWait, in the F2 genotypes, the only ones with B_ are Cc BB and Cc Bb. So:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ (so Pigmented) unless they are cc, which they aren't.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the F2, the presence of B_ determines Pigmented. So:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ \u2192 Pigmented, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ \u2192 Pigmented, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc BB: cc \u2192 Plain, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: cc \u2192 Plain, B_ \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F2 population includes both C_ and cc, so the Phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown (Red Brown) \u2192 75%\n2. Plain, Brown (Plain Brown) \u2192 25%\n\nBecause the only way to be Plain is if both alleles are cc. But in the F2, all the C_ birds are Pigmented, and the cc birds are Plain. So the Phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75% (all C_ birds)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (all cc birds)\n\nAdditionally, there's a possibility of:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (Red Checkered) \u2192 0% because all have C_ (so Pigmented)\n- Plain, Checkered (Plain Checkered) \u2192 0% because none have B_ (as all have B_ or B in Cc and Bb cases?)\n\nWait, no\u2014for Cc Bb, the bird is C_ and B_, so Pigmented and Brown. For cc BB, it's cc (Plain) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown. For cc Bb, it's cc (Plain) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown. So only C_ and cc lead to different Phenotypes.\n\nSo the final phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Red Brown: 75%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Not matching\nOption D: 2, 6, 3, 9 \u2192 Not matching\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Not matching\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Not matching\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Not matching\n\nNone of the options seem to match my calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nCalculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible F2 genotypes.\n\n- Red Brown (C_ and B_): All C_ are Pigmented, so the F2 has 75% C_ (including Cc and CC) and 25% cc. So:\n\n  - Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Red Brown\n  - Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Red Brown\n  - cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTotal Red Brown: 75% (25+50)\nTotal Plain Brown: 25% (25)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 75 : 25 = 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C says 9:3:3:1, which is a typical dihybrid ratio. That suggests that I misapplied the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual counts based on the F2 generation. Let me assume that the F2 population consists of 100 individuals.\n\nF2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: 0% \u2192 Plain, Brown (because cc Bb would be Pigmented due to B_, but in our case, none have B_, only C_ and cc)\n\nWait, no\u2014cc Bb would have B_ (since B is dominant), so it's Pigmented and Brown.\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- Cc Bb: C_ and B_ \u2192 Pigmented, Brown\n- cc BB: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n\nSo all C_ and cc lead to different Phenotypes. Thus:\n\n- Pigmented and Brown (Red Brown): 75% (25 + 50)\n- Plain and Brown (Plain Brown): 25% (25)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (Red Brown : Plain Brown). But the options don't reflect this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9 \u2192 Total 20\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Total ",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant, it'll have none. But given that Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb, and their F2 would include all possible combinations where either C or c is present and either B or b is present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, let's approach it by determining the possible genotypes and then mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for the F2 generation are:\n\n1. CC BB (both C and B dominant)\n2. CC Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. CC bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n6. Cc bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n7. cc BB (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb (c recessive, B recessive)\n9. cc bb (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n- CC bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo now, let's count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nLooking at the list above:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB and Cc BB \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: CC Bb and Cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals\n\nWait, that adds up to 8 individuals, which makes sense because each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic classes, each appearing twice. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype class appears twice, totaling 8. However, looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nYes, that's nine individuals, with three Checkered Phenotypes (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Checkered Brown?) Wait, no\u2014Wait, I see that I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered Red (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: Plain Red (CC Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown (CC bb)\nPhenotype 4: Checkered Red (Cc BB)\nPhenotype 5: Plain Red (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 6: Plain Brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 7: Checkered Brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 8: Plain Brown (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 9: Plain Brown (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's nine phenotypes, but when counting, I realize that some phenotypes appear more than once. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1 and 4 \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u2192 1 individual\n- Plain Brown: Pheno 3 and 6 \u2192 2 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno 7 \u2192 1 individual\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+1+2+1=6, which is less than 9. Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAh, I see the confusion. The Phenotype 2 is Plain Red, which counts as 1. Similarly, Phenotype 7 is Checkered Brown, which counts as 1. Therefore, the distribution is:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: 1 individual\n- Plain Brown: 3 individuals (Pheno 3,5,8)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 individual\n\nWait, that totals 2+1+3+1=7, still missing one. Maybe I missed a phenotype. Let me list them again properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThat's nine phenotypes. Now, grouping them:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u21921\n- Plain Brown: Pheno3,6,8\u21923\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno7\u21921\n\nTotal 2+1+3+1=7, but there are nine phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014I must have miscounted. Wait, no, each of the nine listed corresponds to a unique phenotype, except for the fact that some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no, each of the nine listed is distinct. So, 2 Checkered Red, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, and 1 Checkered Brown. That adds up to 7. Wait, that's impossible because there are nine possible phenotypes. Let me go through each possibility again:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) & B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C (Red) & b (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c (Plain) & B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c (Plain) & b (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each occurring multiple times. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me try again:\n\nEach bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's determine how many birds fall into each category.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Plain Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Checkered Brown\n5. Plain Red\n6. Plain Brown\n7. Checkered Brown\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Brown\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: 3,6,8 \u21923\n- Checkered Brown:7 \u21921\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:3:1, adding up to 8. Wait, that's only 8, but there are 9 birds. Where's the ninth? Oh, no\u2014that's correct\u2014each bird falls into exactly one category, so 2 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, 1 Checkered Brown. So the ratio is 2:2:3:1. But looking back, the options provided don't include such a ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2\n\nB. 6:2:0:2\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 12:2:2:0\n\nL. 5:3:2:6\n\nM. 4:4:4:4\n\nN. 12:2:2:0\n\nO. 5:3:2:6\n\nP. 7:5:1:3\n\nQ. 2:6:3:1\n\nR. 12:2:2:0\n\nS. 5:3:2:6\n\nT. 3:9:1:3\n\nU. 6:2:0:2\n\nV. 4:4:4:4\n\nW. 12:2:2:0\n\nX. 5:3:2:6\n\nY. 3:9:1:3\n\nZ. 6:2:0:2\n\nSo option K is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, which doesn't match our 9 birds. Option N is 12:2:2:0, same issue. Option T is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option Z is 6:2:0:2, summing to 10. Option M is 12:2:2:0, same as before. Option O is 5:3:2:6, summing to 16. Option S is 5:3:2:6, same. Option V is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option A and B are 6:2:0:2, summing to 10. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16.\n\nWait, I think I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1 and 4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u21921\n- Plain Brown: Pheno3,6,8\u21923\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno7\u21921\n\nTotal:2+1+3+1=7. But that leaves out two birds. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those not explicitly listed. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation is all possible gametes from the parents, which is 16 possible combinations (4 x 4), but upon examination, only 9 of them result in the observed phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (which typically results in 9 phenotypic classes) would have 9 phenotypes, but depending on dominance, fewer may combine into one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's use a Punnett square approach.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. The F1 generation is CcBb. The F2 comes from F1 selfing, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Thus, the Punnett square would have each of these gametes combining with each other. However, since the parents are homozygous, all their gametes are equally likely. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | Cc | Cc |\n        +---+---+---+---+---+\n        |   |   |   |   |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\ncc B    | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\ncc B    | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\n\nWait, but this seems incorrect because each gene is treated separately. Let me simplify by considering each gene independently. For the C locus, possible gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). For the B locus, same: Bb \u2192 B or b. So the F2 will have 4 combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes, but some phenotypes will overlap due to dominance. However, the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by the independent assortment and dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: C present (either C_B or C_bb)\n- Brown: B present (B_B or B_bb)\n- Checkered: c present (cc_B or cc_bb)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the ratios for each gene. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 for dominant:recessive. But since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these. However, the phenotypic classes are determined by the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant (Red) and B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant (Red) and B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive (Checkered) and B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive (Checkered) and B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, there are four phenotypic classes. Each class's frequency depends on the probabilities of each gene being present.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C dominant (Red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of C recessive (Checkered) = 0.5 (since only c recessive is present in F2)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B dominant (Brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\n- Probability of B recessive (Checkered) = 0.5 (only b recessive is present)\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. But since both genes contribute to the same phenotype, the overall phenotypic ratio isn't simply 1:1:1:1 but needs to account for dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two copies of each gene, so the phenotype is determined by whether each allele is dominant. Since both genes affect the phenotype, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of both traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 1 * 1 = 1\n- C dominant, B recessive: 1 * 0 = 0\n- C recessive, B dominant: 0 * 1 = 0\n- C recessive, B recessive: 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds are Checkered Red, which contradicts our previous understanding. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance rules.\n\nWait, no\u2014dominance works differently. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays that trait. So for the C locus, any C gives red. For the B locus, any B gives brown. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain Red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain Brown\n\nEach of these can occur with certain probabilities based on the F2 generation. Since both genes are acting independently, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered Red: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- Plain Red: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n- Checkered Brown: P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n- Plain Brown: P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nBut wait, this can't be right because the sum exceeds 1. That indicates an error in reasoning. Instead, the correct way is to recognize that each gene's effect is independent, so the phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to compute the probability for each phenotype by considering the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nFor example, Check",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If only one is dominant, it'll have one trait. If neither is dominant, it'll have none. But given that Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb, and their F2 would include all possible combinations where either C or c is present and either B or b is present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, let's approach it by determining the possible genotypes and then mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for the F2 generation are:\n\n1. CC BB (both C and B dominant)\n2. CC Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. CC bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB (C dominant, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb (C dominant, B recessive)\n6. Cc bb (C dominant, b recessive)\n7. cc BB (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb (c recessive, B recessive)\n9. cc bb (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n- CC bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc bb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo now, let's count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nLooking at the list above:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB and Cc BB \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: CC Bb and Cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 individuals\n\nWait, that adds up to 8 individuals, which makes sense because each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 phenotypic classes, each appearing twice. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype class appears twice, totaling 8. However, looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nYes, that's nine individuals, with three Checkered Phenotypes (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Checkered Brown?) Wait, no\u2014Wait, I see that I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered Red (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: Plain Red (CC Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown (CC bb)\nPhenotype 4: Checkered Red (Cc BB)\nPhenotype 5: Plain Red (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 6: Plain Brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 7: Checkered Brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 8: Plain Brown (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 9: Plain Brown (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's nine phenotypes, but when counting, I realize that some phenotypes appear more than once. Specifically:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1 and 4 \u2192 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u2192 1 individual\n- Plain Brown: Pheno 3 and 6 \u2192 2 individuals\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno 7 \u2192 1 individual\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+1+2+1=6, which is less than 9. Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAh, I see the confusion. The Phenotype 2 is Plain Red, which counts as 1. Similarly, Phenotype 7 is Checkered Brown, which counts as 1. Therefore, the distribution is:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 individuals\n- Plain Red: 1 individual\n- Plain Brown: 3 individuals (Pheno 3,5,8)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 individual\n\nWait, that totals 2+1+3+1=7, still missing one. Maybe I missed a phenotype. Let me list them again properly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThat's nine phenotypes. Now, grouping them:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u21921\n- Plain Brown: Pheno3,6,8\u21923\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno7\u21921\n\nTotal 2+1+3+1=7, but there are nine phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014I must have miscounted. Wait, no, each of the nine listed corresponds to a unique phenotype, except for the fact that some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no, each of the nine listed is distinct. So, 2 Checkered Red, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, and 1 Checkered Brown. That adds up to 7. Wait, that's impossible because there are nine possible phenotypes. Let me go through each possibility again:\n\nPossible phenotypes based on C and B:\n\n1. C (Red) & B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C (Red) & b (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c (Plain) & B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c (Plain) & b (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each occurring multiple times. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me try again:\n\nEach bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's determine how many birds fall into each category.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Plain Red\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Checkered Brown\n5. Plain Red\n6. Plain Brown\n7. Checkered Brown\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Brown\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: 2,5 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: 3,6,8 \u21923\n- Checkered Brown:7 \u21921\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:3:1, adding up to 8. Wait, that's only 8, but there are 9 birds. Where's the ninth? Oh, no\u2014that's correct\u2014each bird falls into exactly one category, so 2 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown, 1 Checkered Brown. So the ratio is 2:2:3:1. But looking back, the options provided don't include such a ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6:2:0:2\n\nB. 6:2:0:2\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 12:2:2:0\n\nL. 5:3:2:6\n\nM. 4:4:4:4\n\nN. 12:2:2:0\n\nO. 5:3:2:6\n\nP. 7:5:1:3\n\nQ. 2:6:3:1\n\nR. 12:2:2:0\n\nS. 5:3:2:6\n\nT. 3:9:1:3\n\nU. 6:2:0:2\n\nV. 4:4:4:4\n\nW. 12:2:2:0\n\nX. 5:3:2:6\n\nY. 3:9:1:3\n\nZ. 6:2:0:2\n\nSo option K is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, which doesn't match our 9 birds. Option N is 12:2:2:0, same issue. Option T is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option Z is 6:2:0:2, summing to 10. Option M is 12:2:2:0, same as before. Option O is 5:3:2:6, summing to 16. Option S is 5:3:2:6, same. Option V is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option A and B are 6:2:0:2, summing to 10. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16.\n\nWait, I think I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pheno 1 and 4 \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Pheno 2 \u21921\n- Plain Brown: Pheno3,6,8\u21923\n- Checkered Brown: Pheno7\u21921\n\nTotal:2+1+3+1=7. But that leaves out two birds. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those not explicitly listed. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation is all possible gametes from the parents, which is 16 possible combinations (4 x 4), but upon examination, only 9 of them result in the observed phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (which typically results in 9 phenotypic classes) would have 9 phenotypes, but depending on dominance, fewer may combine into one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's use a Punnett square approach.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. The F1 generation is CcBb. The F2 comes from F1 selfing, so the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Thus, the Punnett square would have each of these gametes combining with each other. However, since the parents are homozygous, all their gametes are equally likely. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | Cc | Cc |\n        +---+---+---+---+---+\n        |   |   |   |   |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\nC B    | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\ncc B    | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\ncc B    | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb | ccBb |\n        |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|\n        | cb | cb | cb | cb |   |\n\nWait, but this seems incorrect because each gene is treated separately. Let me simplify by considering each gene independently. For the C locus, possible gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). For the B locus, same: Bb \u2192 B or b. So the F2 will have 4 combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes, but some phenotypes will overlap due to dominance. However, the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by the independent assortment and dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: C present (either C_B or C_bb)\n- Brown: B present (B_B or B_bb)\n- Checkered: c present (cc_B or cc_bb)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the ratios for each gene. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 for dominant:recessive. But since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratio combines these. However, the phenotypic classes are determined by the combination of both traits.\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant (Red) and B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant (Red) and B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. C recessive (Checkered) and B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive (Checkered) and B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nThus, there are four phenotypic classes. Each class's frequency depends on the probabilities of each gene being present.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C dominant (Red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of C recessive (Checkered) = 0.5 (since only c recessive is present in F2)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B dominant (Brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\n- Probability of B recessive (Checkered) = 0.5 (only b recessive is present)\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. But since both genes contribute to the same phenotype, the overall phenotypic ratio isn't simply 1:1:1:1 but needs to account for dominance.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has two copies of each gene, so the phenotype is determined by whether each allele is dominant. Since both genes affect the phenotype, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of both traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both dominant (C and B): 1 * 1 = 1\n- C dominant, B recessive: 1 * 0 = 0\n- C recessive, B dominant: 0 * 1 = 0\n- C recessive, B recessive: 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds are Checkered Red, which contradicts our previous understanding. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance rules.\n\nWait, no\u2014dominance works differently. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays that trait. So for the C locus, any C gives red. For the B locus, any B gives brown. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Plain Red\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Checkered Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive: Plain Brown\n\nEach of these can occur with certain probabilities based on the F2 generation. Since both genes are acting independently, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered Red: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- Plain Red: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n- Checkered Brown: P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n- Plain Brown: P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nBut wait, this can't be right because the sum exceeds 1. That indicates an error in reasoning. Instead, the correct way is to recognize that each gene's effect is independent, so the phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to compute the probability for each phenotype by considering the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nFor example, Check",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those two traits as well.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those two traits as well. Only if both are recessive do the birds have neither trait. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Pigment red and Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 0 (since c is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The probability of a bird being C (red) is 100%, because any bird with at least one dominant allele C will express the red trait. Similarly, B (brown) is expressed if at least one dominant allele B is present.\n\nSo, the probability of a bird being C (red) is 100%, and the probability of B (brown) is also 100%.\n\nTherefore, every bird in this population will have both traits: pigment red and brown, unless something is wrong. Wait, but that contradicts the idea of dominance. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the checkered pattern is due to the c allele, which affects the overall appearance regardless of pigment color. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, brown color is recessive, and checkered is dominant. Pigment color is controlled by gene C, where dominant (C) results in red, recessive (c) results in plain. So, for color, the presence of dominant C results in red, and presence of recessive c results in plain. Brown is a separate trait, determined by the recessive allele b, meaning that brown is always expressed if the bird has at least one b allele, while checkered is expressed if both alleles are c.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\", so the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. Similarly, \"red color is controlled by dominant gene C\"\u2014so dominant C makes red, recessive c makes plain. Brown is controlled by recessive allele b\u2014so presence of b makes brown, and without b, it's checkered. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color:\n  - C \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n\n- B is dominant for color:\n  - B \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent because the problem says \"checkered\" is caused by the recessive allele, but \"brown\" is caused by the recessive allele as well. Hmm, perhaps the problem is structured such that both traits are influenced by different alleles. So, to get brown, the bird must have at least one B allele, and to get checkered, it must have at least one c allele. Pigmented color is achieved only if there's at least one C allele.\n\nSo, for a bird to be brown, it needs at least one B (either B or B), and to be checkered, it needs at least one c (either c or c). Pigmented red requires at least one C (C or C).\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown: Needs at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigmented red and checkered: Needs at least one C and at least one c.\n3. Plain and brown: Needs at least one c and at least one B.\n4. Plain and checkered: Needs at least one c and at least one c (i.e., both alleles are c).\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype based on the genetic makeup of the parents.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- C \u2192 red\n- B \u2192 brown\nSo Parent 1 is both C (red) and B (brown). Therefore, Parent 1 is CC BB, so it will produce gametes CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n- c \u2192 plain\n- b \u2192 checkered\nSo Parent 2 is both c (plain) and b (checkered). Therefore, Parent 2 is cc bb, so it will produce gametes cb.\n\nWhen Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb) mate, the F1 generation will receive either CB or cb from each parent. Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, the F1 will be CcBb (as previously thought).\n\nIn the F1, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (B and b):\n\n- BB (probability 25%)\n- Bb (probability 50%)\n- bb (probability 25%)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible F2 phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: Pigmented red (at least C) and brown (at least B)\n   - This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B allele.\n   - From the C locus: C (probability 75%)\n   - From the B locus: B (probability 75%)\n   - Combined probability: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (i.e., 56.25%)\n\n2. Phenotype 2: Pigmented red (at least C) and checkered (at least c)\n   - At least one C and at least one c.\n   - Probability: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (i.e., 18.75%)\n\n3. Phenotype 3: Plain (no C) and brown (at least B)\n   - At least one c and at least one B.\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (i.e., 18.75%)\n\n4. Phenotype 4: Plain (no C) and checkered (no B)\n   - At least one c and at least one c.\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (i.e., 6.25%)\n\nSo now, the F2 phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%. To simplify, we can convert these percentages into whole numbers by finding a common factor. Multiply each by 16 to eliminate decimals: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those two traits as well. Only if both are recessive do the birds have neither trait. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Pigment red and Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 0 (since c is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The probability of a bird being C (red) is 100%, because any bird with at least one dominant allele C will express the red trait. Similarly, B (brown) is expressed if at least one dominant allele B is present.\n\nSo, the probability of a bird being C (red) is 100%, and the probability of B (brown) is also 100%.\n\nTherefore, every bird in this population will have both traits: pigment red and brown, unless something is wrong.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",

    "rollout": " But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele can mask the effect of the other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, so all offspring from this parent will receive C and B alleles. Parent 2 is cc bb, so all offspring will receive c and b. Therefore, all F2 offspring will inherit CC from Parent 1 and cc from Parent 2, making their genotypes CCcc for the C locus and BBbb for the B locus. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute C and B alleles. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute c and b alleles. So each F2 offspring will get one allele from each parent for each gene. Therefore:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- From Parent 1: C\n- From Parent 2: c\nSo the possible alleles for C are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- From Parent 1: B\n- From Parent 2: b\nPossible alleles for B are B and b.\n\nTherefore, each F2 bird's genotype will be Cc for the C locus and Bb for the B locus. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so each F1 is CcBb, and then F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So for each gene, the alleles are inherited independently. Therefore, for the C locus: possible alleles are C and c (each at 50%), same for B locus: B and b (each at 50%). Therefore, the F2 birds will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (for C) and BB (for B)\n- CC (for C) and Bb (for B)\n- cc (for C) and BB (for B)\n- cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n\nEach combination has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC \u2192 red (dominant C)\n- cc \u2192 plain (recessive c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- Bb \u2192 checkered (recessive b)\n\nSince both loci are independent, the phenotype of a bird is determined by whether it has dominant alleles for either or both genes. The phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered (but since B is dominant, it'll appear as brown, and C being dominant makes it red. So overall, it's red-brown.)\nWait, no\u2014it's two separate traits. So, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has C (pale red) and B (brown), it will have red-brown.\n- If it has C (pale red) and b (checkered), it'll have red-checkered.\n- If it has c (plain) and B (brown), it'll have plain-brown.\n- If it has c (plain) and b (checkered), it'll have plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's determine how many birds fall into each category. Since each gene is segregating independently, the number of birds in each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of having red and brown (both dominant) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, but that seems off because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to display the corresponding trait. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it displays both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered and Brown \u2192 requires C (pale red) and B (brown). Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Wait, that can't be right because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to show the trait. Wait, actually, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. But given that, the probability would be higher than 1, which isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me correct that. The probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of showing the dominant trait is 1 (since any dominant allele shows the trait). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate because a bird could have a recessive allele but still show the dominant trait due to masking. Wait, no\u2014it's the opposite. If both alleles are recessive, the bird shows the recessive trait. Otherwise, it shows the dominant trait. So for each gene, if at least one dominant allele is present, the bird will exhibit the corresponding trait. Therefore, the probability of having the dominant trait for a gene is the probability of having at least one dominant allele.\n\nGiven that, for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - If the bird has at least one C allele, it will have red pigment.\n  - If it has both c alleles, it will have plain.\n- Similarly for B (body color):\n  - At least one B allele \u2192 brown\n  - At least one b allele \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the probability of having the dominant pigment trait (red) is the probability of having at least one C allele, which is 1 - (probability of cc). Since each parent contributes one allele, the probability of getting cc from each parent is 1/4, so combined it's 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Thus, the probability of having at least one C allele is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16. Similarly, for B, the probability of at least one B allele is 15/16.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the probability of having both dominant traits is (15/16) * (15/16) = 225/256 \u2248 0.879, which is almost certain. This suggests that most birds will have both traits, but let's verify.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the actual phenotypes based on genotype:\n\nEach bird's genotype is CcBb. Let's list all possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 plain-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 red-brown\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n\nEach of these four genotypes occurs with equal probability (25%) because the parents are homozygous and the F2 generation is formed by random segregation. Therefore, each phenotype corresponds to one of these four cases, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, each phenotype appearing equally often. However, looking back at the options provided, none directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options are different ratios. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 checkered brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these match my calculation. I thought each phenotype was equally likely, but according to the options, the sum of each option adds up to 20 birds in F2, but let's see what each option sums to:\n\nOption A: 6+2+6+2=16\nOption B: 8+4+0+4=16\nOption C: 9+3+3+1=16\nOption D: 2+6+3+9=20\nOption E: 3+9+1+3=16\nOption F: 4+4+4+4=16\nOption G: 12+2+2+6=22\nOption H: 5+3+2+6=16\nOption I: 7+5+1+3=16\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Maybe the question expects us to consider the number of each genotype rather than the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the question: \"phenotypic ratio\" refers to the distribution among the observed phenotypes. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of how many birds have each combination. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered) should occur 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking again at the options provided, Option F says 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. That would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes, but the actual count in F2 would depend on the number of possible genotypes. However, the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb). The Punnett square would yield four possible genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb. These correspond to four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often. However, looking at the answer options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. The closest is Option F, which states 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. But that would mean that each phenotype accounts for 4 out of 16, which is 25% each, consistent with our previous conclusion. However, the problem may be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It mentions \"the checkered red bird\" and \"the plain brown bird,\" implying that the F2 generation includes these specific phenotypes. However, the F2 generation shouldn't include these specific phenotypes unless they are part of the F2 generation. Let me think again: In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are the combinations of the two genes. As established, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the answer options don't provide such a ratio. Perhaps the confusion arises from treating the traits separately instead of considering them together. Let me try another angle.\n\nIf we consider only the pigment color (C/B) and ignore the body color (B/b), then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) masks brown (B), so all C individuals will be red regardless of body color.\n- Plain (c) masks neither.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown (B) masks checkered (b), so all B individuals will be brown regardless of pigment color.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAs before, each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking at the answer options, none match this exact ratio. The closest is Option F, which lists 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. This aligns with the 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the problem statement asks for the phenotypic ratio, which could also refer to the number of birds with each specific phenotype, not the ratio among all possible phenotypes. \n\nIn that case, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (as per Option F)\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nTotaling 16 birds. However, the problem specifies to choose the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion among all phenotypes, not the absolute counts. Therefore, Option F reflects a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is appropriate. Looking back, Option F indeed states 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds, which fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is Option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele can mask the effect of the other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, so all offspring from this parent will receive C and B alleles. Parent 2 is cc bb, so all offspring will receive c and b. Therefore, all F2 offspring will inherit CC from Parent 1 and cc from Parent 2, making their genotypes CCcc for the C locus and BBbb for the B locus. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute C and B alleles. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute c and b alleles. So each F2 offspring will get one allele from each parent for each gene. Therefore:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- From Parent 1: C\n- From Parent 2: c\nSo the possible alleles for C are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- From Parent 1: B\n- From Parent 2: b\nPossible alleles for B are B and b.\n\nTherefore, each F2 bird's genotype will be Cc for the C locus and Bb for the B locus. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so each F1 is CcBb, and then F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. So for each gene, the alleles are inherited independently. Therefore, for the C locus: possible alleles are C and c (each at 50%), same for B locus: B and b (each at 50%). Therefore, the F2 birds will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (for C) and BB (for B)\n- CC (for C) and Bb (for B)\n- cc (for C) and BB (for B)\n- cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n\nEach combination has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC \u2192 red (dominant C)\n- cc \u2192 plain (recessive c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB \u2192 brown (dominant B)\n- Bb \u2192 checkered (recessive b)\n\nSince both loci are independent, the phenotype of a bird is determined by whether it has dominant alleles for either or both genes. The phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered (but since B is dominant, it'll appear as brown, and C being dominant makes it red. So overall, it's red-brown.)\nWait, no\u2014it's two separate traits. So, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has C (pale red) and B (brown), it will have red-brown.\n- If it has C (pale red) and b (checkered), it'll have red-checkered.\n- If it has c (plain) and B (brown), it'll have plain-brown.\n- If it has c (plain) and b (checkered), it'll have plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's determine how many birds fall into each category. Since each gene is segregating independently, the number of birds in each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of having red and brown (both dominant) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1, but that seems off because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to display the corresponding trait. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it displays both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered and Brown \u2192 requires C (pale red) and B (brown). Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Wait, that can't be right because each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to show the trait. Wait, actually, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. But given that, the probability would be higher than 1, which isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me correct that. The probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of showing the dominant trait is 1 (since any dominant allele shows the trait). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate because a bird could have a recessive allele but still show the dominant trait due to masking. Wait, no\u2014it's the opposite. If both alleles are recessive, the bird shows the recessive trait. Otherwise, it shows the dominant trait. So for each gene, if at least one dominant allele is present, the bird will exhibit the corresponding trait. Therefore, the probability of having the dominant trait for a gene is the probability of having at least one dominant allele.\n\nGiven that, for each gene:\n\n- For C (pigment):\n  - If the bird has at least one C allele, it will have red pigment.\n  - If it has both c alleles, it will have plain.\n- Similarly for B (body color):\n  - At least one B allele \u2192 brown\n  - At least one b allele \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the probability of having the dominant pigment trait (red) is the probability of having at least one C allele, which is 1 - (probability of cc). Since each parent contributes one allele, the probability of getting cc from each parent is 1/4, so combined it's 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Thus, the probability of having at least one C allele is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16. Similarly, for B, the probability of at least one B allele is 15/16.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the probability of having both dominant traits is (15/16) * (15/16) = 225/256 \u2248 0.879, which is almost certain. This suggests that most birds will have both traits, but let's verify.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the actual phenotypes based on genotype:\n\nEach bird's genotype is CcBb. Let's list all possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 plain-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 red-brown\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n\nEach of these four genotypes occurs with equal probability (25%) because the parents are homozygous and the F2 generation is formed by random segregation. Therefore, each phenotype corresponds to one of these four cases, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, each phenotype appearing equally often. However, looking back at the options provided, none directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options are different ratios. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 checkered brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these match my calculation. I thought each phenotype was equally likely, but according to the options, the sum of each option adds up to 20 birds in F2, but let's see what each option sums to:\n\nOption A: 6+2+6+2=16\nOption B: 8+4+0+4=16\nOption C: 9+3+3+1=16\nOption D: 2+6+3+9=20\nOption E: 3+9+1+3=16\nOption F: 4+4+4+4=16\nOption G: 12+2+2+6=22\nOption H: 5+3+2+6=16\nOption I: 7+5+1+3=16\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misapplied the principles. Maybe the question expects us to consider the number of each genotype rather than the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the question: \"phenotypic ratio\" refers to the distribution among the observed phenotypes. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio is expressed in terms of how many birds have each combination. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype (red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered) should occur 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking again at the options provided, Option F says 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown. That would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio across the four phenotypes, but the actual count in F2 would depend on the number of possible genotypes. However, the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb). The Punnett square would yield four possible genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb. These correspond to four phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often. However, looking at the answer options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. The closest is Option F, which states 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. But that would mean that each phenotype accounts for 4 out of 16, which is 25% each, consistent with our previous conclusion. However, the problem may be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It mentions \"the checkered red bird\" and \"the plain brown bird,\" implying that the F2 generation includes these specific phenotypes. However, the F2 generation shouldn't include these specific phenotypes unless they are part of the F2 generation. Let me think again: In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are the combinations of the two genes. As established, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the answer options don't provide such a ratio. Perhaps the confusion arises from treating the traits separately instead of considering them together. Let me try another angle.\n\nIf we consider only the pigment color (C/B) and ignore the body color (B/b), then:\n\n- Pigment red (C) masks brown (B), so all C individuals will be red regardless of body color.\n- Plain (c) masks neither.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown (B) masks checkered (b), so all B individuals will be brown regardless of pigment color.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAs before, each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking at the answer options, none match this exact ratio. The closest is Option F, which lists 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds. This aligns with the 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the problem statement asks for the phenotypic ratio, which could also refer to the number of birds with each specific phenotype, not the ratio among all possible phenotypes. \n\nIn that case, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (as per Option F)\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nTotaling 16 birds. However, the problem specifies to choose the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion among all phenotypes, not the absolute counts. Therefore, Option F reflects a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is appropriate. Looking back, Option F indeed states 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown, totaling 16 birds, which fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is Option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait without the other.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird will have the corresponding trait without the other. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. If a bird is heterozygous (CcBb), it can still have both dominant traits. Only when both genes are recessive do you get neither trait. Wait, but in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so all F2 birds will have either CC (from parent 1) and whatever from parent 2, and cc (from parent 2) and whatever from parent 1. Wait, no, because both parents are homozygous for each gene. Wait, that changes things. If both parents are homozygous for each gene, then all F2 will inherit those homozygous alleles. Because each parent contributes one allele to the offspring. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, each gamete will carry the dominant C and dominant B alleles. Parent 2 is cc bb, each gamete will carry the recessive c and recessive b alleles. So all F2 offspring will be Cc Bb. Therefore, all F2 will have both dominant traits: pigment red (C) and brown (B), regardless of the other alleles. Wait, that makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% for the phenotype where both traits are expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds would be checkered red. But looking back at the options given, none of them match that. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, each bird has two genes, and the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). So, when crossed, all F2 will be Cc Bb, leading to both dominant traits\u2014so all will be checkered red. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red. But looking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc.\u2014nope.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, etc.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, etc.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc.\nWait, none of these options seem to fit my conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about F2 but about F1 and F2 separately? Let me go through the initial steps again. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be Cc Bb, as I thought earlier. Then, the F1 is selfed to produce F2. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, CB and cb. Because Parent 1 can only give CB, and Parent 2 can only give cb. So the gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo, each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. The phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n- CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n- Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain\n- bb (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Instead, perhaps it's better to consider the possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined independently, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits dominant: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered red\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur based on the combination of the two genes. Now, how many F2 individuals fall into each category?\n\nSince the F2 is 1/4 chance for each genotype, let's see:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Dominant (C): 3/4 (because 25% CC, 25% Cc)\n  - Recessive (c): 1/4 (cc)\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): 3/4 (C B and C Bb)\n  - Recessive (b): 1/4 (c B and c bb)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown (b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. Now, translating these fractions into actual counts based on a hypothetical number of F2 individuals, say 16, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered red and brown: 9\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Wait, but according to our calculation, the Checkered red count is 3, Checkered brown is 3, and the others are 9 and 1 respectively. So the correct order would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 9\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option D, which lists Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, etc. Option A lists Checkered red 6, which doesn't match our 3. Option E mentions Checkered red 3, which matches our first point, but the rest don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question and need to look at the F1 instead of the F2. Let me check what the F1 looks like. The F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes, as I outlined before. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 Checkered red and brown : 3 Checkered red : 3 Checkered brown : 1 Checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact breakdown. Looking back, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which fits our numbers if we rearrange them. So option D is the closest match.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the user provided a detailed list of gametes for the F1, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. They also showed the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes leading to the F2. So perhaps the intended answer considers the F1 rather than the F2. Let me recast my analysis around the F1.\n\nIf the question was asking about the F1 generation, the phenotypic ratio would be different. The F1 would be Cc Bb, which would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. The resulting F1 \u00d7 F1 would lead to four phenotypes as discussed earlier. So, if the question were about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from Cc Bb x Cc Bb, but wait no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, which produces gametes CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have the four types as above.)\n\nBut the question clearly states that the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, implying F2. Therefore, the correct answer based on the F2 analysis is option D, which reflects the 1 Checkered, 3 Checkered brown, 9 Plain red, 3 Plain brown ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But looking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc.\u2014nope.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, etc.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, etc.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc.\nWait, none of these options seem to fit my conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about F2 but about F1 and F2 separately? Let me go through the initial steps again. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be Cc Bb, as I thought earlier. Then, the F1 is selfed to produce F2. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, CB and cb. Because Parent 1 can only give CB, and Parent 2 can only give cb. So the gametes would be CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each occurring 25% of the time. Thus, the F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSo, each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. The phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n- CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n- Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain\n- bb (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- bb (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Instead, perhaps it's better to consider the possible combinations of the two traits. Since each trait is determined independently, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits dominant: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered red\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur based on the combination of the two genes. Now, how many F2 individuals fall into each category?\n\nSince the F2 is 1/4 chance for each genotype, let's see:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Dominant (C): 3/4 (because 25% CC, 25% Cc)\n  - Recessive (c): 1/4 (cc)\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): 3/4 (C B and C Bb)\n  - Recessive (b): 1/4 (c B and c bb)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Brown (b): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n3. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment recessive (c) and Brown (b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. Now, translating these fractions into actual counts based on a hypothetical number of F2 individuals, say 16, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered red and brown: 9\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option D states: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Wait, but according to our calculation, the Checkered red count is 3, Checkered brown is 3, and the others are 9 and 1 respectively. So the correct order would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 9\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option D, which lists Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, etc. Option A lists Checkered red 6, which doesn't match our 3. Option E mentions Checkered red 3, which matches our first point, but the rest don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question and need to look at the F1 instead of the F2. Let me check what the F1 looks like. The F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes, as I outlined before. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 Checkered red and brown : 3 Checkered red : 3 Checkered brown : 1 Checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact breakdown. Looking back, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" which fits our numbers if we rearrange them. So option D is the closest match.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the user provided a detailed list of gametes for the F1, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. They also showed the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes leading to the F2. So perhaps the intended answer considers the F1 rather than the F2. Let me recast my analysis around the F1.\n\nIf the question was asking about the F1 generation, the phenotypic ratio would be different. The F1 would be Cc Bb, which would produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. The resulting F1 \u00d7 F1 would lead to four phenotypes as discussed earlier. So, if the question were about F1, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from Cc Bb x Cc Bb, but wait no\u2014the F1 is Cc Bb, which produces gametes CB and cb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have the four types as above.)\n\nBut the question clearly states that the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, implying F2. Therefore, the correct answer based on the F2 analysis is option D, which reflects the 1 Checkered, 3 Checkered brown, 9 Plain red, 3 Plain brown ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, it's possible to have a bird where one trait is expressed due to one gene, and another due to another gene.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, it's possible to have a bird where one trait is expressed due to one gene, and another due to another gene. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's genotype for each gene contributes to its phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires at least one dominant allele for each gene.\nSo,\nP(C) = 1 (since C is dominant and any C results in red)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is dominant and any B results in brown)\nThus, P(Phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 but that can\u2019t be right because it suggests every bird has both traits, which contradicts the idea that each bird could have either trait based on gene expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. A bird will have pigment red if it has at least one dominant C allele, and brown if it has at least one dominant B allele. Similarly, it will be plain if it has at least one recessive c allele, and checkered if it has at least one recessive b allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits: pigment and body color. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Now, to determine the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene contributing to the dominant or recessive state. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Let's get back. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene is segregating independently, so for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C:\n- C (dominant) : 50%\n- c (recessive) : 50%\n\nGene B:\n- B (dominant) : 50%\n- b (recessive) : 50%\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant (C and B). This happens when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_), so the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Again, this seems wrong because it suggests every bird has both traits, which isn't realistic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the genes interact. Perhaps each bird has one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. In reality, each bird can have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, resulting in different phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird has two separate traits, and the combination of dominant and recessive alleles determines the phenotype without necessarily expressing both traits simultaneously. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Typically, an organism shows all its visible traits based on its alleles. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it'll have red color, and if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it'll have brown. Similarly, if it lacks a dominant allele for pigment (c), it'll be plain, and lack a dominant allele for body color (b), it'll be checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are indeed based on the combination of the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities should sum to 1. I must have made a mistake in interpreting the possible phenotypes. Let me list them correctly:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, calculating probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: P(C_) * P(b_) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. Plain and brown: P(c_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. Plain and checkered: P(c_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSumming these: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which exceeds 1. This indicates an error in my approach. Instead, I should realize that each bird has two independent traits, and the combination of dominant and recessive alleles affects each trait separately. Therefore, the actual number of phenotypic categories is 2 x 2 = 4, but the probabilities aren't simply additive because each trait is determined by one gene. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the concept. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, but each trait is determined independently. So the four phenotypes are indeed mutually exclusive, and their probabilities should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nTotal: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which still sums to more than 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. The correct way is to recognize that the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive, and each has a certain probability based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Since each bird has two independent genes, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 2^2 x 2^2 = 16, but phenotypically, only four distinct combinations occur. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the rules for each trait:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B): If at least one dominant allele (C or B), the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Body color (b/b): If at least one dominant allele (B or b), the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSince the two traits are determined independently, the four phenotypic categories correspond to:\n\n1. Red and Brown\n2. Red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each category can be calculated by considering the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles:\n\n1. Red and Brown: To have both traits, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n   P(Red) = 1 (since any C makes it red)\n   P(Brown) = 1 (since any B makes it brown)\n   P(both) = P(Red) * P(Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   But this can't be correct because it would imply every bird has both traits.\n\n2. Red and Checkered: Only the presence of a recessive allele for B matters. So:\n   P(Red) = 1\n   P(Checkered) = P(b) = 0.5\n   P(both) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\n3. Plain and Brown: Only the presence of a recessive allele for C matters. So:\n   P(Plain) = P(c) = 0.5\n   P(Brown) = 1\n   P(both) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n\n4. Plain and Checkered: Presence of both recessive alleles. So:\n   P(Plain) = 0.5\n   P(Checkered) = 0.5\n   P(both) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, adding these probabilities: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 1. Clearly, the issue arises because the assumption that every bird has both dominant alleles for each gene is incorrect. Instead, each bird has two independent genes, and the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the trait. Therefore, the four phenotypic categories are correctly defined as above, but the calculation needs to account for the fact that each bird can have any combination of dominant and recessive alleles, not requiring both dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nHowever, given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype directly. Since the parents are both homozygous, but their offspring may exhibit various combinations. Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nWhen these combine, the F1 (which is technically not needed here) would be CcBb, but the F2 comes from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the question specifies an F2 generation, implying that we're looking beyond F1. However, the initial setup mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. But the F2 generation refers to the offspring of F1 \u00d7 F1. Wait, that can't be right because the F1 is already produced by crossing the two parents, so the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1. However, the question states \"the adi hybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which suggests that the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, not from F2 \u00d7 F2. This part is confusing because typically, F2 is from F1 \u00d7 F1, but the question says it's from a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, which is F1 \u00d7 F1, not F2 \u00d7 F2.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed with the standard dihybrid cross from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would have the following genotypic combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n       | C  | c\n-------|----|----\n     C    | CC | Cc\n       |----|----\n     c      | Cc | cc\n\nAnd then expanding further for the other gene:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is 50% C and 50% c for gene C, and 50% B and 50% b for gene B. Therefore, the Punnett square for C and B would be a grid of 2x2 for each gene, leading to 4x4=16 possible genotypic combinations. From these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the probabilities directly. For each gene, the segregation is 50% dominant (C or B) and 50% recessive (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the overall probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's define each phenotype by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (1) * (1) = 1 \u2192 Impossible, so this is incorrect.\n   \nWait, clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let me instead calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 This requires at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\nP(Pigment red) = 1 (because any C gives red)\nP(Brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\nThus, P(Pigment red and Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Again, this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Requires C dominant and B recessive:\nP(Pigment red) = 1\nP(Checkered) = P(b) = 0.5\nThus, P(Pigment red and Checkered) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Requires c recessive and B dominant:\nP(Plain) = P(c) = 0.5\nP(Brown) = 1\nThus, P(Plain and Brown) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Requires c recessive and b recessive:\nP(Plain) = 0.5\nP(Checkered) = 0.5\nThus, P(Plain and Checkered) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, adding these probabilities: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which is greater than 1. Clearly, I've misunderstood something. The correct approach is to realize that the four phenotypic categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, meaning each bird falls into exactly one category. Therefore, the probabilities should sum to 1, indicating that I've incorrectly calculated the probabilities by treating each trait separately without accounting for overlapping conditions.\n\nInstead, let's use a table to map each possible combination of alleles to the corresponding phenotype. Each bird has two alleles for pigment (C or c) and two alleles for body color (B or b). The presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- If C is present (either C_ or c_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (either B_ or b_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Always true (probability 1)\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability 0.5\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability 0.5\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability 0.25\n\nBut again, this leads to a sum greater than 1, which is impossible. The correct way is to recognize that the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive, and their probabilities should sum to 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assigning the probabilities. Let's instead calculate the probabilities correctly by considering the possible genotypes for each trait and combining them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: 2/3 (since 1/3 chance of cc)\n- cc: 1/3\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- B_: 2/3\n- bb: 1/3\n\nNow, the four phenotypes can be represented as combinations of these probabilities:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, it's possible to have a bird where one trait is expressed due to one gene, and another due to another gene. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. Each bird's genotype for each gene contributes to its phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires at least one dominant allele for each gene.\nSo,\nP(C) = 1 (since C is dominant and any C results in red)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is dominant and any B results in brown)\nThus, P(Phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 but that can\u2019t be right because it suggests every bird has both traits, which contradicts the idea that each bird could have either trait based on gene expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. A bird will have pigment red if it has at least one dominant C allele, and brown if it has at least one dominant B allele. Similarly, it will be plain if it has at least one recessive c allele, and checkered if it has at least one recessive b allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits: pigment and body color. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Now, to determine the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene contributing to the dominant or recessive state. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the probabilities:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Let's get back. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene is segregating independently, so for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C:\n- C (dominant) : 50%\n- c (recessive) : 50%\n\nGene B:\n- B (dominant) : 50%\n- b (recessive) : 50%\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant (C and B). This happens when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_), so the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Again, this seems wrong because it suggests every bird has both traits, which isn't realistic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the genes interact. Perhaps each bird has one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. In reality, each bird can have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, resulting in different phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird has two separate traits, and the combination of dominant and recessive alleles determines the phenotype without necessarily expressing both traits simultaneously. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Typically, an organism shows all its visible traits based on its alleles. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it'll have red color, and if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it'll have brown. Similarly, if it lacks a dominant allele for pigment (c), it'll be plain, and lack a dominant allele for body color (b), it'll be checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are indeed based on the combination of the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B) \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B) \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b) \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities should sum to 1. I must have made a mistake in interpreting the possible phenotypes. Let me list them correctly:\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, calculating probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: P(C_) * P(b_) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. Plain and brown: P(c_) * P(B_) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. Plain and checkered: P(c_) * P(b_) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSumming these: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which exceeds 1. This indicates an error in my approach. Instead, I should realize that each bird has two independent traits, and the combination of dominant and recessive alleles affects each trait separately. Therefore, the actual number of phenotypic categories is 2 x 2 = 4, but the probabilities aren't simply additive because each trait is determined by one gene. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the concept. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, but each trait is determined independently. So the four phenotypes are indeed mutually exclusive, and their probabilities should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\nPhenotype 3: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\nPhenotype 4: c dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nTotal: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which still sums to more than 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. The correct way is to recognize that the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive, and each has a certain probability based on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles. Since each bird has two independent genes, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 2^2 x 2^2 = 16, but phenotypically, only four distinct combinations occur. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the rules for each trait:\n\n- Pigment color (C/B): If at least one dominant allele (C or B), the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Body color (b/b): If at least one dominant allele (B or b), the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSince the two traits are determined independently, the four phenotypic categories correspond to:\n\n1. Red and Brown\n2. Red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each category can be calculated by considering the combinations of dominant and recessive alleles:\n\n1. Red and Brown: To have both traits, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n   P(Red) = 1 (since any C makes it red)\n   P(Brown) = 1 (since any B makes it brown)\n   P(both) = P(Red) * P(Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   But this can't be correct because it would imply every bird has both traits.\n\n2. Red and Checkered: Only the presence of a recessive allele for B matters. So:\n   P(Red) = 1\n   P(Checkered) = P(b) = 0.5\n   P(both) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\n3. Plain and Brown: Only the presence of a recessive allele for C matters. So:\n   P(Plain) = P(c) = 0.5\n   P(Brown) = 1\n   P(both) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n\n4. Plain and Checkered: Presence of both recessive alleles. So:\n   P(Plain) = 0.5\n   P(Checkered) = 0.5\n   P(both) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, adding these probabilities: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 1. Clearly, the issue arises because the assumption that every bird has both dominant alleles for each gene is incorrect. Instead, each bird has two independent genes, and the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the trait. Therefore, the four phenotypic categories are correctly defined as above, but the calculation needs to account for the fact that each bird can have any combination of dominant and recessive alleles, not requiring both dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nHowever, given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype directly. Since the parents are both homozygous, but their offspring may exhibit various combinations. Let's construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nWhen these combine, the F1 (which is technically not needed here) would be CcBb, but the F2 comes from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the question specifies an F2 generation, implying that we're looking beyond F1. However, the initial setup mentions a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. But the F2 generation refers to the offspring of F1 \u00d7 F1. Wait, that can't be right because the F1 is already produced by crossing the two parents, so the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1. However, the question states \"the adi hybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which suggests that the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, not from F2 \u00d7 F2. This part is confusing because typically, F2 is from F1 \u00d7 F1, but the question says it's from a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, which is F1 \u00d7 F1, not F2 \u00d7 F2.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed with the standard dihybrid cross from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would have the following genotypic combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n       | C  | c\n-------|----|----\n     C    | CC | Cc\n       |----|----\n     c      | Cc | cc\n\nAnd then expanding further for the other gene:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is 50% C and 50% c for gene C, and 50% B and 50% b for gene B. Therefore, the Punnett square for C and B would be a grid of 2x2 for each gene, leading to 4x4=16 possible genotypic combinations. From these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the probabilities directly. For each gene, the segregation is 50% dominant (C or B) and 50% recessive (c or b). Since the genes are independent, the overall probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nLet's define each phenotype by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (1) * (1) = 1 \u2192 Impossible, so this is incorrect.\n   \nWait, clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let me instead calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 This requires at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\nP(Pigment red) = 1 (because any C gives red)\nP(Brown) = 1 (any B gives brown)\nThus, P(Pigment red and Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Again, this can't be right because it implies 100% of the population has both traits.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Requires C dominant and B recessive:\nP(Pigment red) = 1\nP(Checkered) = P(b) = 0.5\nThus, P(Pigment red and Checkered) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Requires c recessive and B dominant:\nP(Plain) = P(c) = 0.5\nP(Brown) = 1\nThus, P(Plain and Brown) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Requires c recessive and b recessive:\nP(Plain) = 0.5\nP(Checkered) = 0.5\nThus, P(Plain and Checkered) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, adding these probabilities: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25, which is greater than 1. Clearly, I've misunderstood something. The correct approach is to realize that the four phenotypic categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, meaning each bird falls into exactly one category. Therefore, the probabilities should sum to 1, indicating that I've incorrectly calculated the probabilities by treating each trait separately without accounting for overlapping conditions.\n\nInstead, let's use a table to map each possible combination of alleles to the corresponding phenotype. Each bird has two alleles for pigment (C or c) and two alleles for body color (B or b). The presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- If C is present (either C_ or c_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (cc), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (either B_ or b_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (bb), the bird is checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Always true (probability 1)\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability 0.5\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability 0.5\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability 0.25\n\nBut again, this leads to a sum greater than 1, which is impossible. The correct way is to recognize that the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive, and their probabilities should sum to 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assigning the probabilities. Let's instead calculate the probabilities correctly by considering the possible genotypes for each trait and combining them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: 2/3 (since 1/3 chance of cc)\n- cc: 1/3\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- B_: 2/3\n- bb: 1/3\n\nNow, the four phenotypes can be represented as combinations of these probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 0.444\n2. Pigment red (C_) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability = P(C_) * P(b_) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B_) \u2192 Probability = P(cc) * P(B_) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b_) \u2192 Probability = P(cc) * P(b_) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 0.111\n\nThese probabilities sum to approximately 0.444 + 0.222 + 0.222 + 0.111 = 1, which works. Now, converting these fractions to percentages:\n\n- 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\n",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, it won't.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, it won't. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant)\n3. Plain and brown (only c dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (no C or B)\n\nNow, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nWait, that can't be right. Because if either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird has both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird doesn't have that trait. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C dominant \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3: Only b dominant (since c is recessive) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that seems off because in reality, some birds might have one trait but not the other, depending on dominance. But according to the given rules, dominance applies to both traits. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it'll display both traits. Otherwise, it won't. So the possible phenotypes are based solely on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in each bird. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective traits, all their offspring should follow Mendelian ratios. Let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1 (since both alleles are dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 0\n\nSo, the only phenotypes possible are those where both C and B are dominant. Any bird without a dominant allele for either trait won't have those traits expressed. Therefore, all birds will have both traits unless they lack at least one dominant allele. Wait, but the parents are homozygous for their respective dominant traits, so all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all birds will have both traits.\n\nWait, that can't be correct because the options don't include 100% for any phenotype. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait! The problem says \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele c, and \"plain\" is recessive for C. So, a bird is checkered (c) and plain (C) simultaneously? No, each bird can only have one of the two alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014a bird can have either dominant or recessive for each gene, but not both. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- C and B: Pigment red and brown\n- C and b: Pigment red and checkered\n- c and B: Plain and brown\n- c and b: Plain and checkered\n\nSince all parents are homozygous for their dominant traits, all their offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, meaning none will be c and b. Therefore, all phenotypes are possible except for the last combination (c and b), which isn't possible. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, and Plain and checkered. \n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the probability of a bird having Pigment red and brown is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%?\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right. Because each bird must have either dominant or recessive alleles for each gene. So, the probability that a bird has Pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and the probability of Brown is also 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, the probability of both traits appearing is 1 * 1 = 1, which would mean all birds have both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have certain traits. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem states that the checkered color comes from the recessive allele c, implying that a bird could have c and C alleles, resulting in checkered. Similarly, brown is B, and plain is c.\n\nWait, no, the checkered color is due to the recessive allele c, which combines with the dominant C to produce a checkered pattern. So, a bird with at least one c allele will be checkered, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, a bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of the B allele. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown. So, the only phenotype that doesn't occur is if a bird lacks both dominant alleles. Wait, but the parents are both homozygous dominant, so all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all birds will have both traits. Thus, all phenotypes will occur, but perhaps their ratios are different based on the segregation of the alleles. Wait, no\u2014each bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they will always express both traits. Therefore, all phenotypes are possible, but their observed frequencies depend on how often each trait appears together. Wait, but in reality, some birds may have one trait and not the other, but according to the problem statement, each bird has both traits. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider each gene separately and then combine them. For the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C present) = 1\n- Probability of Plain (c present) = 0\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of Brown (B present) = 1\n- Probability of Checkered (b present) = 0\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore:\n\n- Both Pigment red and Brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Plain and Brown: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Plain and Checkered: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis suggests that all birds will have both traits, but that can't be right because the options don't reflect a 100% ratio. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the dominance rules. Wait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes differently. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it expresses both, otherwise, it doesn't. But in this case, since both parents are homozygous dominant, all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each trait, thus expressing both. Therefore, all phenotypes will be present, but their ratios would depend on how often each combination occurs. Wait, but each bird can only have one allele for each gene, so the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore:\n\n- C_B: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- C_b: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- c_B: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- c_b: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that still results in 100% for Pigment red and Brown, and 0% for others. That doesn't seem right because some birds might not have both traits. Perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each trait will display both traits. If it has any recessive allele for either trait, it won't display that trait. Wait, no\u2014it displays all dominant traits. So, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each trait will have both traits expressed. Otherwise, it won't have any of the recessive traits. Wait, that makes more sense. So, for a bird to have both Pigment red and Brown, it needs to have at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B. If it has a recessive allele for either trait, it won't display that trait. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is displayed or not. Therefore:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it has both traits.\n- If it has at least one C and no B, it has Pigment red but not Brown.\n- If it has no C and at least one B, it has Brown but not Pigment red.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it has neither trait.\n\nBut wait, according to the dominance hierarchy, a bird can only have a trait if it has at least one dominant allele for that trait. So, a bird with at least one C will have Pigment red, regardless of whether it has a B or not. Similarly, a bird with at least one B will have Brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one c will have Plain, regardless of B, and a bird with at least one b will have Checkered, regardless of C.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown (C_B): This requires at least one C and at least one B. Since both parents are homozygous dominant, every offspring will have at least one C and one B, so this phenotype will occur 100% of the time.\n- For Pigment red and Checkered (C_b): This requires at least one C and at least one b. Since the second parent (cc bb) has both alleles recessive, all offspring will inherit b for the B trait, making this phenotype impossible (probability 0).\n- For Plain and Brown (c_B): Requires at least one c and at least one B. Again, since the other parent (cc bb) provides b for B, this phenotype is impossible (probability 0).\n- For Plain and Checkered (c_b): This requires at least one c and at least one b. Since both parents provide both recessive alleles, this phenotype is impossible (probability 0).\n\nThis suggests that all birds will exhibit Pigment red and Brown, which contradicts the options provided. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the recessive alleles affect the expression of the traits differently. For example, a bird with both a dominant and recessive allele for a trait may not express it fully. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele c, implying that a bird with at least one c allele will be checkered. Similarly, brown is determined by at least one B allele. So, if a bird has both a dominant C and a recessive c, it will have Pigment red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with at least one B and no c will have Brown. Wait, but if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits. If it has any recessive alleles, it won't have the corresponding trait. So, the phenotypes are indeed determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nBut the problem arises because the options suggest that all four phenotypes are possible, which conflicts with my analysis. Perhaps the issue is that I'm not accounting for the fact that the parents' genotypes allow for all possible offspring combinations. Let me list the possible gametes from each parent:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of CB and cb gametes, each occurring at 50%. When F1 (CB and cb) selfs, the possible offspring are:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSo the F2 generation consists of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, when creating the Punnett square for F2, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B)\n- 25% CC bb (all C and b)\n- 25% cc BB (all c and B)\n- 25% cc bb (all c and b)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n- CC bb: Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown (c_B)\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\n- All four phenotypes occur with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options involve different ratios. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, none of these options seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that I must have misinterpreted the problem. Let me reconsider the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the checkered pattern is controlled by the same dominant gene as the pigment color. So, both C and c influence both the pigment color and the checkered pattern. This changes things. So, the dominant allele C affects both pigment color (red) and checkered pattern, while the recessive allele c affects both pigment color (plain) and checkered pattern.\n\nIn that case, the problem becomes a dihybrid cross where both traits are influenced by the same two genes, leading to a more complex phenotypic outcome.\n\nLet me redefine the problem under this assumption:\n\nBoth traits (pigment color and checkered pattern) are governed by the same two genes, C and c, with C being dominant for both traits and c recessive. Therefore, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\n- C (for pigment red and checkered)\n- c (for pigment plain and checkered)\n\nSimilarly for B and b:\n\n- B (for brown)\n- b (for plain)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nWhen these parents are crossed, all offspring will have the following genotypes for each trait:\n\n- For pigment color: Since Parent 1 is CC and Parent 2 is cc, the offspring will be Cc (50% chance for each allele). So, half will have pigment red (C) and half will have pigment plain (c).\n- For checkered pattern: Since Parent 1 is BB and Parent 2 is bb, the offspring will be Bb (50% chance for each allele). So, half will be checkered (B) and half will be plain (b).\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes for each trait are:\n\n- Pigment red: 50% of all offspring\n- Pigment plain: 50% of all offspring\n- Checkered: 50% of all offspring\n- Plain: 50% of all offspring\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. Since both traits are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios will be determined by the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, each phenotype will have a 25% probability.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the previous analysis, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the checkered pattern and pigment color are linked, meaning they are inherited together as a single unit. In that case, the genes are linked, and the phenotypic ratios would differ. However, the problem didn't mention anything about linkage, so I assume they are independent.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem counts the number of each phenotype rather than their ratio. For instance, if all offspring are red and checkered (since Parent 1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, it won't. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant)\n3. Plain and brown (only c dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (no C or B)\n\nNow, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nWait, that can't be right. Because if either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird has both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird doesn't have that trait. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C dominant \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 3: Only b dominant (since c is recessive) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 0%\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that seems off because in reality, some birds might have one trait but not the other, depending on dominance. But according to the given rules, dominance applies to both traits. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it'll display both traits. Otherwise, it won't. So the possible phenotypes are based solely on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in each bird. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective traits, all their offspring should follow Mendelian ratios. Let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1 (since both alleles are dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered) = 0\n\nSo, the only phenotypes possible are those where both C and B are dominant. Any bird without a dominant allele for either trait won't have those traits expressed. Therefore, all birds will have both traits unless they lack at least one dominant allele. Wait, but the parents are homozygous for their respective dominant traits, so all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all birds will have both traits.\n\nWait, that can't be correct because the options don't include 100% for any phenotype. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait! The problem says \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele c, and \"plain\" is recessive for C. So, a bird is checkered (c) and plain (C) simultaneously? No, each bird can only have one of the two alleles for each gene. Wait, no\u2014a bird can have either dominant or recessive for each gene, but not both. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- C and B: Pigment red and brown\n- C and b: Pigment red and checkered\n- c and B: Plain and brown\n- c and b: Plain and checkered\n\nSince all parents are homozygous for their dominant traits, all their offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, meaning none will be c and b. Therefore, all phenotypes are possible except for the last combination (c and b), which isn't possible. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain and brown, and Plain and checkered. \n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the probability of a bird having Pigment red and brown is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%?\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right. Because each bird must have either dominant or recessive alleles for each gene. So, the probability that a bird has Pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and the probability of Brown is also 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, the probability of both traits appearing is 1 * 1 = 1, which would mean all birds have both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds might not have certain traits. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem states that the checkered color comes from the recessive allele c, implying that a bird could have c and C alleles, resulting in checkered. Similarly, brown is B, and plain is c.\n\nWait, no, the checkered color is due to the recessive allele c, which combines with the dominant C to produce a checkered pattern. So, a bird with at least one c allele will be checkered, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, a bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of the B allele. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown. So, the only phenotype that doesn't occur is if a bird lacks both dominant alleles. Wait, but the parents are both homozygous dominant, so all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Therefore, all birds will have both traits. Thus, all phenotypes will occur, but perhaps their ratios are different based on the segregation of the alleles. Wait, no\u2014each bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they will always express both traits. Therefore, all phenotypes are possible, but their observed frequencies depend on how often each trait appears together. Wait, but in reality, some birds may have one trait and not the other, but according to the problem statement, each bird has both traits. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider each gene separately and then combine them. For the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C present) = 1\n- Probability of Plain (c present) = 0\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of Brown (B present) = 1\n- Probability of Checkered (b present) = 0\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotypic ratios are determined by the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore:\n\n- Both Pigment red and Brown: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Plain and Brown: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- Plain and Checkered: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nThis suggests that all birds will have both traits, but that can't be right because the options don't reflect a 100% ratio. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the dominance rules. Wait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes differently. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it expresses both, otherwise, it doesn't. But in this case, since both parents are homozygous dominant, all offspring will have at least one dominant allele for each trait, thus expressing both. Therefore, all phenotypes will be present, but their ratios would depend on how often each combination occurs. Wait, but each bird can only have one allele for each gene, so the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore:\n\n- C_B: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n- C_b: 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- c_B: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n- c_b: 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nWait, that still results in 100% for Pigment red and Brown, and 0% for others. That doesn't seem right because some birds might not have both traits. Perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each trait will display both traits. If it has any recessive allele for either trait, it won't display that trait. Wait, no\u2014it displays all dominant traits. So, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each trait will have both traits expressed. Otherwise, it won't have any of the recessive traits. Wait, that makes more sense. So, for a bird to have both Pigment red and Brown, it needs to have at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B. If it has a recessive allele for either trait, it won't display that trait. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is displayed or not. Therefore:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it has both traits.\n- If it has at least one C and no B, it has Pigment red but not Brown.\n- If it has no C and at least one B, it has Brown but not Pigment red.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it has neither trait.\n\nBut wait, according to the dominance hierarchy, a bird can only have a trait if it has at least one dominant allele for that trait. So, a bird with at least one C will have Pigment red, regardless of whether it has a B or not. Similarly, a bird with at least one B will have Brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one c will have Plain, regardless of B, and a bird with at least one b will have Checkered, regardless of C.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red and Brown (C_B): This requires at least one C and at least one B. Since both parents are homozygous dominant, every offspring will have at least one C and one B, so this phenotype will occur 100% of the time.\n- For Pigment red and Checkered (C_b): This requires at least one C and at least one b. Since the second parent (cc bb) has both alleles recessive, all offspring will inherit b for the B trait, making this phenotype impossible (probability 0).\n- For Plain and Brown (c_B): Requires at least one c and at least one B. Again, since the other parent (cc bb) provides b for B, this phenotype is impossible (probability 0).\n- For Plain and Checkered (c_b): This requires at least one c and at least one b. Since both parents provide both recessive alleles, this phenotype is impossible (probability 0).\n\nThis suggests that all birds will exhibit Pigment red and Brown, which contradicts the options provided. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the recessive alleles affect the expression of the traits differently. For example, a bird with both a dominant and recessive allele for a trait may not express it fully. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele c, implying that a bird with at least one c allele will be checkered. Similarly, brown is determined by at least one B allele. So, if a bird has both a dominant C and a recessive c, it will have Pigment red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with at least one B and no c will have Brown. Wait, but if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will have both traits. If it has any recessive alleles, it won't have the corresponding trait. So, the phenotypes are indeed determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nBut the problem arises because the options suggest that all four phenotypes are possible, which conflicts with my analysis. Perhaps the issue is that I'm not accounting for the fact that the parents' genotypes allow for all possible offspring combinations. Let me list the possible gametes from each parent:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of CB and cb gametes, each occurring at 50%. When F1 (CB and cb) selfs, the possible offspring are:\n\n- CB + CB = CcBb\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + CB = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nSo the F2 generation consists of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, when creating the Punnett square for F2, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B)\n- 25% CC bb (all C and b)\n- 25% cc BB (all c and B)\n- 25% cc bb (all c and b)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and Brown (C_B)\n- CC bb: Pigment red and Checkered (C_b)\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown (c_B)\n- cc bb: Plain and Checkered (c_b)\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\n- All four phenotypes occur with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none of them match a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options involve different ratios. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nSo, none of these options seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This suggests that I must have misinterpreted the problem. Let me reconsider the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the checkered pattern is controlled by the same dominant gene as the pigment color. So, both C and c influence both the pigment color and the checkered pattern. This changes things. So, the dominant allele C affects both pigment color (red) and checkered pattern, while the recessive allele c affects both pigment color (plain) and checkered pattern.\n\nIn that case, the problem becomes a dihybrid cross where both traits are influenced by the same two genes, leading to a more complex phenotypic outcome.\n\nLet me redefine the problem under this assumption:\n\nBoth traits (pigment color and checkered pattern) are governed by the same two genes, C and c, with C being dominant for both traits and c recessive. Therefore, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\n- C (for pigment red and checkered)\n- c (for pigment plain and checkered)\n\nSimilarly for B and b:\n\n- B (for brown)\n- b (for plain)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nWhen these parents are crossed, all offspring will have the following genotypes for each trait:\n\n- For pigment color: Since Parent 1 is CC and Parent 2 is cc, the offspring will be Cc (50% chance for each allele). So, half will have pigment red (C) and half will have pigment plain (c).\n- For checkered pattern: Since Parent 1 is BB and Parent 2 is bb, the offspring will be Bb (50% chance for each allele). So, half will be checkered (B) and half will be plain (b).\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes for each trait are:\n\n- Pigment red: 50% of all offspring\n- Pigment plain: 50% of all offspring\n- Checkered: 50% of all offspring\n- Plain: 50% of all offspring\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. Since both traits are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios will be determined by the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, each phenotype will have a 25% probability.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the previous analysis, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the checkered pattern and pigment color are linked, meaning they are inherited together as a single unit. In that case, the genes are linked, and the phenotypic ratios would differ. However, the problem didn't mention anything about linkage, so I assume they are independent.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem counts the number of each phenotype rather than their ratio. For instance, if all offspring are red and checkered (since Parent 1",

  {
    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, only one trait will be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, only one trait will be expressed. Wait, but in reality, each bird has two independent traits. So the phenotype for each trait is determined separately, and the overall phenotype is a combination. So let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits, which are determined by the dominant alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain color and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain color and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The notation should reflect the presence of dominant alleles. Pigment red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C_B_): Pigment red and brown.\n2. Pigment red (C_), Brown recessive (bb): Pigment red and checkered.\n3. Plain color (cc), Brown dominant (B_): Plain color and brown.\n4. Plain color (cc), Brown recessive (bb): Plain color and checkered.\n\nSo now, the probabilities for each category can be calculated by determining the probability of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both parents are homozygous (for pigment and color), the probability of each allele passing on is 100% for the pigment gene and 50% for the color gene. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC and cc, so for pigment (C/c), the gametes are all C (since both parents are homozygous for C). For color (B/b), the parents are cc, so all gametes are c. So the F1 will always have Cc (from parent 1) and Bb (from parent 2?), wait no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All gametes are CB (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All gametes are cb (since both alleles are recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 will be CcBb. Then, F2 will be formed by selfing F1. Each parent contributes CB or cb gametes equally (50% each). So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (dominant) and Brown (dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (dominant) and Brown (recessive)\n- cc: Plain color (recessive) and Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Plain color (recessive) and Brown (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain color and Brown\n4. Plain color and Checkered\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown: Both genes are dominant. From F1, the parents were CC BB and cc bb. In F2, the possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (50% each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the probability of being Pigment red and Brown (CC) is 25%.\n\nThe probability of being Pigment red and Checkered (Cc) comes from the Cc genotype, where the c allele is present (since B is recessive). The probability of Cc is 50%, but within those, half will be Cb (phenotype Pigment red, Checkered) and half will be cc (Pigment plain, Brown). Wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of the c allele in the second gene determines the phenotype for the color. So in Cc, regardless of the pigment, the color is determined by the second gene. So in Cc, the phenotype will be Pigment red (since C is dominant) and the color (B) is recessive, so Checkered. Similarly, in cc, the phenotype is Plain color and Brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: 25%\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: 50% (since Cc will always show red, and B is recessive)\n3. Plain color and Brown: 25%\n4. Plain color and Checkered: 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%. So the ratio is 1:2:1:1. Wait, no\u2014because Pigment red and Brown is 25%, Pigment red and Checkered is 50% (since Cc), Plain color and Brown is 25%, and Plain color and Checkered is 25%. So the ratio is 1 (Red and Brown) : 2 (Red and Checkered) : 1 (Plain and Brown) : 1 (Plain and Checkered). But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, such as:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nWait, my calculation shows 1:2:1:1, which corresponds to ratios of 1, 2, 1, 1. Looking at the options, option B says checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Hmm, that seems different. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option H is 5,3,2,6. None of them match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance patterns. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has a certain probability. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in F1, the B allele is recessive (bb), so in F2, the B allele could still be present in gametes, leading to B_ in F2. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the gametes are CB and cb. So in F2, the B allele can be present or not depending on whether the gamete carries it.\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach might not be correct. Let me instead consider the actual F2 results. The F2 will have four phenotypic classes based on the dominant alleles in each gene. The number of each class depends on the probabilities of each combination. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) = 1 (all C cases: CC, Cc, Cc, cc)\n- Probability of Brown (B) = 1 (all B cases: BB, Bb, Bb, bb)\nWait, no\u2014no, that's not correct. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the overall probability isn't simply the product of each gene's probability because the phenotypes are combined.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain, Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, but many may overlap. However, considering dominance, some genotypes will lead to the same phenotype. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (if C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain color and Brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain color and Checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on how often each combination occurs. Each gene is inherited independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C_B_):\n- Probability of C_ = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of B_ = 1 (since B is dominant)\n- So overall probability = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because it implies all birds would have both traits, which isn't the case. This suggests an error in the way I'm calculating the probabilities. Instead, I should compute the probability of each gene being dominant or recessive and then combine them.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C_ = 1 (since all gametes are C)\n- Probability of c = 0 (since all gametes are C)\n\nWait, no\u2014if the parent is CC, all gametes are C, so C is always present. So for pigment color, the probability of being dominant (red) is 1, and recessive (plain) is 0.\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent is cc, so all gametes are c.\n- Thus, probability of B_ = 0 (since B is recessive)\n- Probability of b = 1 (since all gametes are c)\n\nSince both genes must be considered together, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. But in this case, the F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of both parents' gametes. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes along with their counts.\n\nThere are 16 possible F2 genotypes (since each parent contributes 2 alleles, making 4 total alleles, divided into 2 pairs). However, due to dominance, some genotypes will produce the same phenotype. Let me map them:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain color, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain color, Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain color, Checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (pheno 1,2,3,4,5,6): All have at least one dominant C allele and at least one dominant B allele.\n- Pigment red and Checkered (pheno 3,5,7): Have C dominant but not B.\n- Plain color and Brown (pheno 7,8,9): Have c (so no C) but have B.\n- Plain color and Checkered (pheno 8,9): Have neither C nor B.\n\nWait, but this grouping is incorrect because some genotypes fall into multiple phenotypes. For example, CC bb has C_ (pigment red) and bb (checkered), so it's Pigment red and Checkered. Similarly, Cc BB has C_ and B_, so Pigment red and Brown. cc bb has c (so no pigment) and bb (checkered), so Plain color and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's count how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Pheno 1,2,3,4,5,6. How many? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Pheno 1: CC BB\n- Pheno 2: CC Bb\n- Pheno 3: CC bb\n- Pheno 4: Cc BB\n- Pheno 5: Cc Bb\n- Pheno 6: Cc bb\nThat's six genotypes.\n\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Pheno 3,5,7. That's three genotypes: CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB.\n\n- Plain color and Brown: Pheno 7,8,9. Three genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\n- Plain color and Checkered: Pheno 8,9. Two genotypes: cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nNow, each genotype has a certain probability based on the F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, and F2 is selfing, the distribution of each genotype is as follows:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each Cc genotype further splits into Cc (from CB + cb) and cc (from cb + cb), and similarly for the other combinations. So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 1/4 CC\n- 1/4 Cc\n- 1/4 cc\n- 1/4 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The correct distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these four has an equal chance of 25%. Now, considering dominance, each genotype will produce a specific phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 1)\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB: Plain color, Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc Bb: Plain color, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc bb: Plain color, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes would overlap. For example, CC bb and cc bb both have Pigment red and Checkered. Similarly, Cc BB and cc BB both have Pigment red and Brown. And Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red and Checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's inconsistent because Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red and Checkered, whereas CC bb and cc bb have Pigment red and Checkered as well. But in reality, Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red (since C is present) and Checkered (since B is recessive). While CC bb and cc bb have Pigment red and Checkered (since B is recessive). Wait, no\u2014CC bb has B_ because the second allele is b, but B is recessive, so it becomes checkered. Similarly, cc bb also becomes checkered. So the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: Plain color and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Plain color and Checkered\n\nAnd each of these has a certain number of genotypes contributing to them. Let's count:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 5 genotypes?\nWait, no\u2014wait, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n- Cc Bb: 1\n- Cc bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, that's nine genotypes. Now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red, Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 5 genotypes\n- Phenotype 2 (Pigment red, Checkered): CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 3 genotypes\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n\nNow, each genotype has a certain probability. Since each F2 genotype is equally likely (25%), each phenotype's frequency is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that produce it.\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n- Phenotype 2: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Phenotype 4: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the previous calculations. I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of genotypes for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Pigment red, Brown):\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, only one trait will be expressed. Wait, but in reality, each bird has two independent traits. So the phenotype for each trait is determined separately, and the overall phenotype is a combination. So let's approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits, which are determined by the dominant alleles for each gene. So the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain color and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain color and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The notation should reflect the presence of dominant alleles. Pigment red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both genes are dominant (C_B_): Pigment red and brown.\n2. Pigment red (C_), Brown recessive (bb): Pigment red and checkered.\n3. Plain color (cc), Brown dominant (B_): Plain color and brown.\n4. Plain color (cc), Brown recessive (bb): Plain color and checkered.\n\nSo now, the probabilities for each category can be calculated by determining the probability of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both parents are homozygous (for pigment and color), the probability of each allele passing on is 100% for the pigment gene and 50% for the color gene. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC and cc, so for pigment (C/c), the gametes are all C (since both parents are homozygous for C). For color (B/b), the parents are cc, so all gametes are c. So the F1 will always have Cc (from parent 1) and Bb (from parent 2?), wait no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All gametes are CB (since both alleles are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All gametes are cb (since both alleles are recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 will be CcBb. Then, F2 will be formed by selfing F1. Each parent contributes CB or cb gametes equally (50% each). So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (dominant) and Brown (dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (dominant) and Brown (recessive)\n- cc: Plain color (recessive) and Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Plain color (recessive) and Brown (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain color and Brown\n4. Plain color and Checkered\n\nNow, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown: Both genes are dominant. From F1, the parents were CC BB and cc bb. In F2, the possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (50% each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the probability of being Pigment red and Brown (CC) is 25%.\n\nThe probability of being Pigment red and Checkered (Cc) comes from the Cc genotype, where the c allele is present (since B is recessive). The probability of Cc is 50%, but within those, half will be Cb (phenotype Pigment red, Checkered) and half will be cc (Pigment plain, Brown). Wait, no\u2014actually, the presence of the c allele in the second gene determines the phenotype for the color. So in Cc, regardless of the pigment, the color is determined by the second gene. So in Cc, the phenotype will be Pigment red (since C is dominant) and the color (B) is recessive, so Checkered. Similarly, in cc, the phenotype is Plain color and Brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown: 25%\n2. Pigment red and Checkered: 50% (since Cc will always show red, and B is recessive)\n3. Plain color and Brown: 25%\n4. Plain color and Checkered: 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%. So the ratio is 1:2:1:1. Wait, no\u2014because Pigment red and Brown is 25%, Pigment red and Checkered is 50% (since Cc), Plain color and Brown is 25%, and Plain color and Checkered is 25%. So the ratio is 1 (Red and Brown) : 2 (Red and Checkered) : 1 (Plain and Brown) : 1 (Plain and Checkered). But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios, such as:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nWait, my calculation shows 1:2:1:1, which corresponds to ratios of 1, 2, 1, 1. Looking at the options, option B says checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Hmm, that seems different. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option H is 5,3,2,6. None of them match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance patterns. Let me try a different approach. Using a Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these has a certain probability. The phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (since B is dominant)\n- cc BB: Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, Brown\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in F1, the B allele is recessive (bb), so in F2, the B allele could still be present in gametes, leading to B_ in F2. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the gametes are CB and cb. So in F2, the B allele can be present or not depending on whether the gamete carries it.\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach might not be correct. Let me instead consider the actual F2 results. The F2 will have four phenotypic classes based on the dominant alleles in each gene. The number of each class depends on the probabilities of each combination. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C) = 1 (all C cases: CC, Cc, Cc, cc)\n- Probability of Brown (B) = 1 (all B cases: BB, Bb, Bb, bb)\nWait, no\u2014no, that's not correct. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the overall probability isn't simply the product of each gene's probability because the phenotypes are combined.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain, Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, but many may overlap. However, considering dominance, some genotypes will lead to the same phenotype. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (if C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain color and Brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain color and Checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on how often each combination occurs. Each gene is inherited independently, so the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C_B_):\n- Probability of C_ = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of B_ = 1 (since B is dominant)\n- So overall probability = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because it implies all birds would have both traits, which isn't the case. This suggests an error in the way I'm calculating the probabilities. Instead, I should compute the probability of each gene being dominant or recessive and then combine them.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C_ = 1 (since all gametes are C)\n- Probability of c = 0 (since all gametes are C)\n\nWait, no\u2014if the parent is CC, all gametes are C, so C is always present. So for pigment color, the probability of being dominant (red) is 1, and recessive (plain) is 0.\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent is cc, so all gametes are c.\n- Thus, probability of B_ = 0 (since B is recessive)\n- Probability of b = 1 (since all gametes are c)\n\nSince both genes must be considered together, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. But in this case, the F2 genotypes are determined by the combination of both parents' gametes. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes along with their counts.\n\nThere are 16 possible F2 genotypes (since each parent contributes 2 alleles, making 4 total alleles, divided into 2 pairs). However, due to dominance, some genotypes will produce the same phenotype. Let me map them:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc BB: Plain color, Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain color, Checkered\n9. cc bb: Plain color, Checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (pheno 1,2,3,4,5,6): All have at least one dominant C allele and at least one dominant B allele.\n- Pigment red and Checkered (pheno 3,5,7): Have C dominant but not B.\n- Plain color and Brown (pheno 7,8,9): Have c (so no C) but have B.\n- Plain color and Checkered (pheno 8,9): Have neither C nor B.\n\nWait, but this grouping is incorrect because some genotypes fall into multiple phenotypes. For example, CC bb has C_ (pigment red) and bb (checkered), so it's Pigment red and Checkered. Similarly, Cc BB has C_ and B_, so Pigment red and Brown. cc bb has c (so no pigment) and bb (checkered), so Plain color and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's count how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Pheno 1,2,3,4,5,6. How many? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Pheno 1: CC BB\n- Pheno 2: CC Bb\n- Pheno 3: CC bb\n- Pheno 4: Cc BB\n- Pheno 5: Cc Bb\n- Pheno 6: Cc bb\nThat's six genotypes.\n\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Pheno 3,5,7. That's three genotypes: CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB.\n\n- Plain color and Brown: Pheno 7,8,9. Three genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\n- Plain color and Checkered: Pheno 8,9. Two genotypes: cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nNow, each genotype has a certain probability based on the F1 parents. Since F1 is CcBb, and F2 is selfing, the distribution of each genotype is as follows:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each Cc genotype further splits into Cc (from CB + cb) and cc (from cb + cb), and similarly for the other combinations. So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 1/4 CC\n- 1/4 Cc\n- 1/4 cc\n- 1/4 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The correct distribution is:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these four has an equal chance of 25%. Now, considering dominance, each genotype will produce a specific phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 1)\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB: Plain color, Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc Bb: Plain color, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- cc bb: Plain color, Checkered (phenotype 2)\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes would overlap. For example, CC bb and cc bb both have Pigment red and Checkered. Similarly, Cc BB and cc BB both have Pigment red and Brown. And Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red and Checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's inconsistent because Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red and Checkered, whereas CC bb and cc bb have Pigment red and Checkered as well. But in reality, Cc Bb and cc Bb both have Pigment red (since C is present) and Checkered (since B is recessive). While CC bb and cc bb have Pigment red and Checkered (since B is recessive). Wait, no\u2014CC bb has B_ because the second allele is b, but B is recessive, so it becomes checkered. Similarly, cc bb also becomes checkered. So the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: Plain color and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Plain color and Checkered\n\nAnd each of these has a certain number of genotypes contributing to them. Let's count:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 5 genotypes?\nWait, no\u2014wait, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n- Cc Bb: 1\n- Cc bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, that's nine genotypes. Now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red, Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 5 genotypes\n- Phenotype 2 (Pigment red, Checkered): CC bb, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 3 genotypes\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n\nNow, each genotype has a certain probability. Since each F2 genotype is equally likely (25%), each phenotype's frequency is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that produce it.\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n- Phenotype 2: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Phenotype 4: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the previous calculations. I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of genotypes for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Pigment red, Brown):\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. If a bird has the dominant allele for pigment, it will exhibit red regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if it has the dominant allele for color, it'll exhibit brown regardless of the other gene. So the only way a bird won\u2019t have a particular trait is if both alleles are recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_B_): Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment dominant (C_), but B recessive (_b): Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment recessive (c_), but B dominant (_B_): Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment recessive (c_), B recessive (_bb): Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the segregation of alleles. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F2 will follow Mendelian ratios. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (since both alleles are dominant)\nWait, no\u2014wait, each bird must have two alleles for each gene. So for the C locus, each bird has two alleles. The F2 for the C locus will have a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 chance of C (red) and 1/4 chance of c (plain). Similarly, for the B locus, each bird has two alleles. The F2 for the B locus will also have a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 chance of B (brown) and 1/4 chance of b (checkered).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene being dominant or recessive.\n\nLet's list all combinations:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype A (Red Brown)\n2. C_ and _b: Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B (Red Checkered)\n3. c_ and B_: Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype C (Plain Brown)\n4. c_ and _b: Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype D (Plain Checkered)\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. That corresponds to 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D).\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". Wait, that seems off. According to our calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, not matching any of the given options directly. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as follows:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For C (pigment):\n- Homozygous dominant (C) occurs when at least one C allele is passed.\n  - Probability: 3/4 (since in F2, it's 3/4 for dominant)\nFor B (color):\n- Homozygous dominant (B) occurs when at least one B allele is passed.\n  - Probability: 3/4\n\nThus, the joint probabilities are:\n- C_ and B_: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 Red Brown\n- C_ and _b: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Red Checkered\n- c_ and B_: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n- c_ and _b: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option G mentions checkered red 12, etc., which doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Hmm. Perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypic categories. Wait, maybe I confused the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the question, the checkered bird refers to the genotype where both alleles are recessive (bb). The plain bird has at least one recessive allele. Pigment color is red if at least one dominant C allele, else brown. So:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered | bb (both alleles recessive for pigment)\nPlain | at least one recessive for pigment (so could be bb or Bb or Bb)\nBrown | at least one dominant B allele (so could be BB, Bb, or Bb)\nRed | at least one dominant C allele (so could be CC, CB, or CB)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is C_ (at least one C), it will have pigment red regardless of B status. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb (regardless of B)\n- Plain: at least one allele for pigment (could be bb, Bb, or BB)\n- Brown: at least one allele for color (could be BB, Bb, or Bb)\n- Red: at least one C allele (could be CC, CB, or CB)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (bb)\n2. Plain (Bb or BB)\n3. Brown (BB or Bb)\n4. Red (CC or CB or CB)\n\nAnd the expected counts are 9:3:3:1, adding up to 16.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none directly reflect 9:3:3:1. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNo, that's different. Option G was 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which seems inverted. Option J: 2,6,3,1\u2014which isn't matching. Option F: 4,4,4,4\u2014equal distribution. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2014which is 1:3:9:3, which is 3^2, suggesting something else. Option B: 6,2,2,6\u2014doesn't fit. Option A: 6,2,2,2\u2014but sum to 12. Option C: 9,3,3,1\u2014matches our calculation! Oh, so option C says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Checkered (bb)\n2. Plain (Bb or BB)\n3. Brown (BB or Bb)\n4. Red (CC or CB or CB)\n\nAnd the expected counts are 9:3:3:1, adding up to 16.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none directly reflect 9:3:3:1. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNo, that's different. Option G was 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't fit. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which seems inverted. Option J: 2,6,3,1\u2014which isn't matching. Option F: 4,4,4,4\u2014equal distribution. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2014which is 1:3:9:3, which is 3^2, suggesting something else. Option B: 6,2,2,6\u2014doesn't fit. Option A: 6,2,2,2\u2014but sum to 12. Option C: 9,3,3,1\u2014matches our calculation! Oh, so option C says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, it's 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. And if both are recessive, it won't have either trait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will always have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so all birds will have at least one trait expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based solely on the dominance status of each gene. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for C and B. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this is incorrect because Bb means one B and one b, so the bird would have brown and checkered. Similarly, any combination where B is present (dominant) results in brown, regardless of C. So, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by looking at how many of the four possible genotypes result in each phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the number of each genotype in F2 is 25%, 50%, 25%, and 25%, respectively. However, not all genotypes will necessarily express the same phenotype. Specifically, if both C and B are present (i.e., CC BB and CC Bb), then the phenotype is Pigment red and Brown brown. If only C is present (cc BB) or only B is present (CC bb), then the phenotype is Plain and Brown brown or Plain and Brown checkered, respectively. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the actual color may vary depending on dominance. In this case, since the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not by dominance ratios. So, for example, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will display both traits\u2014pigment red and brown. If it has at least one C and none of B (i.e., cc BB or cc Bb), it will display pigment red but not brown. Similarly, if it has none of C (cc BB or cc Bb) but at least one B (CC bb or CC Bb), it will display brown but not checkered. And if it has neither C nor B (which isn't possible here since both parents are homozygous, so all F2 must have at least one C or B), so that's impossible. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Only C dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Only B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. None of C or B dominant \u2192 Impossible, so this isn't a real phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of C and B. Out of the four possible genotypes, two of them will have both traits, and the others will have only one. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:1:1, but wait, that sums up to six parts. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation. Looking back, the options given include various ratios like 6:2:2:0 or similar. Let me recount.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, Phenotype 1 and 2 share the same phenotype (Checkered red and Checkered brown). Phenotype 3 and 4 also share the same phenotype (Plain red and Plain brown). Wait, that can't be right because Phenotype 1 and 2 don't overlap\u2014they both have both traits. Similarly for Phenotype 3 and 4. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype 1 is both Checkered and Red, while Phenotype 2 is Checkered and Brown. They are distinct phenotypes. Same with Phenotype 3 and 4: Plain and Red vs. Plain and Brown. So, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (25%)\n2. Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Plain red (25%)\n4. Plain brown (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back, the options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me see what each option says:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, summing to 16\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, summing to 16\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, summing to 16\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, summing to 16\n\nHmm, my initial calculation suggested 1:1:1:1, but the options don't match that. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, focusing on specific phenotypes rather than overall. Wait, no\u2014the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically refers to the overall distribution across all phenotypes. However, none of the options align with my initial conclusion. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the ratio of F2 individuals that exhibit each phenotype, grouped into the four possible phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question considers only certain combinations, such as those that are viable or survive. For example, maybe the bird cannot be both plain and red, or something else. But the problem statement doesn't mention viability factors beyond survival, so I assume all F2 individuals are viable.\n\nGiven that, I must reconcile why the options don't match my expectation of 1:1:1:1. Let me revisit the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that C is for pigment and B is for color. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, so any bird with at least one dominant C or B will display the associated trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. However, the options suggest a different distribution. Let me consider the options again.\n\nLooking at Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 1+3+9+3=16. This suggests that each phenotype is represented in multiples of 1, 3, 9, and 3. Wait, but according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 1/4 of the population. So why does Option D have a higher count for checkered red and plain red?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check. From the F2 generation, each of the four possible genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb) occurs with equal frequency, i.e., 25% each. Now, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype, so each should occur 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options provided are labeled A through J, but the user wrote \"A. Phenotypic ratio...\" followed by several options, including E and G, etc. But in the original question, the options were labeled A to L, but the user mistakenly included some letters without context. To avoid confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, I must reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio within the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only certain phenotypes. For example, if the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered red or checkered brown, versus plain red or plain brown, that could change things. Let me explore that possibility.\n\nIf the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered (regardless of color) to those that are plain (regardless of color), then:\n\n- Checkered red and checkered brown \u2192 2 out of 4 (since each has two traits)\n- Plain red and plain brown \u2192 2 out of 4\n\nSo the ratio would be 2:2, or simplified to 1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the percentage of birds that are checkered compared to the percentage that are plain, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain: 2/4 = 50%\n\nRatio would be 1:1, but again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question is only concerned with the phenotypic ratios of the F2 generation, not the entire population. For instance, in F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. So, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the number of each phenotype.\n\nAs established earlier, each phenotype corresponds to one of the four genotypes, so each should occur 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't reflected in the answer choices. \n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, summing to 16\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, summing to 16\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, summing to 16\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, summing to 16\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4, summing to 16\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2, summing to 16\n\nLooking at these, the most plausible option based on my earlier reasoning (assuming 1:1:1:1) isn't present. However, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs once, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Since this isn't an option, I must consider that perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of F2 individuals that are either checkered or plain, regardless of color, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only one trait, e.g., red color irrespective of brown, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, where each trait is independent, but the way the options are structured suggests a different calculation. For example, if the question is only considering the percentage of each phenotype relative to others, perhaps it's taking into account only one trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for a single trait, say pigmentation, ignoring color. In that case, each bird has a 50% chance of being checkered or plain, regardless of color. But that would mean a 1:1 ratio for pigmentation, and similarly for color. But this isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the F2 generation for the pigmentation trait, with brown and red being separate traits under pigmentation control. Wait, but the problem specifies that the colors are determined by B and b, so perhaps it's considering the color trait alone.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). So perhaps the question is considering the color trait, ignoring pigment. In that case, the F2 generation would have a phenotypic ratio based on the pigment color, with each bird having a 50% chance of being checkered or plain, regardless of color. But that doesn't explain the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering one trait, say the pigment color, and the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment, regardless of the other trait. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio for pigmentation would be 3:1 (3/4 checkered, 1/4 plain), but the options suggest a different distribution.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me summarize my findings:\n\n- Each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n- Each genotype corresponds to a unique phenotype: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n- Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, I must conclude that I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not asking about the overall ratio but the ratio within the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only certain combinations. For example, if the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered OR plain, regardless of color, then:\n\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Thus, the ratio would be 1:1, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only one trait. For example, the ratio of checkered to plain for pigment color, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Phenotype: Checkered (50%) vs Plain (50%), so 1:1. Again, not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for each possible combination of traits, considering the presence of dominant alleles. But that brings us back to the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match my conclusion, perhaps I should re-express the question's expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question's structure. Let me try to compute the phenotypic ratios as per the options provided.\n\nLooking at Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, the number of checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding these up gives 1+3+9+3=16. This suggests that the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a binomial distribution with n=4 trials, but that's not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait, say pigment color, and the bird's phenotype is determined by whether they are checkered or plain, ignoring color. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation for the pigment color trait alone, with the number of checkered and plain birds in a 3:1 ratio. But again, this doesn't fit the options.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's genotype ratios, not the phenotypic ratios. For example, the number of checkered red, checkered brown, etc., as per the F2 genotype counts. But the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios.\n\nAt this point, I realize that I might have misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the F2 generation is being considered in terms of the number of birds that are either checkered or plain, regardless of color. In that case:\n\n- Number of checkered birds: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Number of plain birds: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Ratio: 1:1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait, say pigment color, and expressing the ratio as the number of birds with checkered vs plain, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Ratio: 1:1\n\nAgain, not matching any option.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer was option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, which represents a 1:3:9:3 ratio, suggesting a binomial distribution with n=4 trials, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated, and the options should reflect the 1:1:1:1 ratio instead.\n\nSince none",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. And if both are recessive, it won't have either trait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will always have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so all birds will have at least one trait expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based solely on the dominance status of each gene. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for C and B. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but this is incorrect because Bb means one B and one b, so the bird would have brown and checkered. Similarly, any combination where B is present (dominant) results in brown, regardless of C. So, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by looking at how many of the four possible genotypes result in each phenotype.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the number of each genotype in F2 is 25%, 50%, 25%, and 25%, respectively. However, not all genotypes will necessarily express the same phenotype. Specifically, if both C and B are present (i.e., CC BB and CC Bb), then the phenotype is Pigment red and Brown brown. If only C is present (cc BB) or only B is present (CC bb), then the phenotype is Plain and Brown brown or Plain and Brown checkered, respectively. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the actual color may vary depending on dominance. In this case, since the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not by dominance ratios. So, for example, if a bird has at least one C and at least one B, it will display both traits\u2014pigment red and brown. If it has at least one C and none of B (i.e., cc BB or cc Bb), it will display pigment red but not brown. Similarly, if it has none of C (cc BB or cc Bb) but at least one B (CC bb or CC Bb), it will display brown but not checkered. And if it has neither C nor B (which isn't possible here since both parents are homozygous, so all F2 must have at least one C or B), so that's impossible. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Only C dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Only B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. None of C or B dominant \u2192 Impossible, so this isn't a real phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of C and B. Out of the four possible genotypes, two of them will have both traits, and the others will have only one. So the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:1:1, but wait, that sums up to six parts. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation. Looking back, the options given include various ratios like 6:2:2:0 or similar. Let me recount.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, Phenotype 1 and 2 share the same phenotype (Checkered red and Checkered brown). Phenotype 3 and 4 also share the same phenotype (Plain red and Plain brown). Wait, that can't be right because Phenotype 1 and 2 don't overlap\u2014they both have both traits. Similarly for Phenotype 3 and 4. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype 1 is both Checkered and Red, while Phenotype 2 is Checkered and Brown. They are distinct phenotypes. Same with Phenotype 3 and 4: Plain and Red vs. Plain and Brown. So, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (25%)\n2. Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Plain red (25%)\n4. Plain brown (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 25% : 25%, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back, the options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me see what each option says:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, summing to 16\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, summing to 16\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, summing to 16\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, summing to 16\n\nHmm, my initial calculation suggested 1:1:1:1, but the options don't match that. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, focusing on specific phenotypes rather than overall. Wait, no\u2014the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically refers to the overall distribution across all phenotypes. However, none of the options align with my initial conclusion. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the ratio of F2 individuals that exhibit each phenotype, grouped into the four possible phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question considers only certain combinations, such as those that are viable or survive. For example, maybe the bird cannot be both plain and red, or something else. But the problem statement doesn't mention viability factors beyond survival, so I assume all F2 individuals are viable.\n\nGiven that, I must reconcile why the options don't match my expectation of 1:1:1:1. Let me revisit the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Wait, no\u2014the problem specifies that C is for pigment and B is for color. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, so any bird with at least one dominant C or B will display the associated trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. However, the options suggest a different distribution. Let me consider the options again.\n\nLooking at Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Sum is 1+3+9+3=16. This suggests that each phenotype is represented in multiples of 1, 3, 9, and 3. Wait, but according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 1/4 of the population. So why does Option D have a higher count for checkered red and plain red?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check. From the F2 generation, each of the four possible genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb) occurs with equal frequency, i.e., 25% each. Now, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype, so each should occur 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. Perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options provided are labeled A through J, but the user wrote \"A. Phenotypic ratio...\" followed by several options, including E and G, etc. But in the original question, the options were labeled A to L, but the user mistakenly included some letters without context. To avoid confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, I must reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio within the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only certain phenotypes. For example, if the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered red or checkered brown, versus plain red or plain brown, that could change things. Let me explore that possibility.\n\nIf the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered (regardless of color) to those that are plain (regardless of color), then:\n\n- Checkered red and checkered brown \u2192 2 out of 4 (since each has two traits)\n- Plain red and plain brown \u2192 2 out of 4\n\nSo the ratio would be 2:2, or simplified to 1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the percentage of birds that are checkered compared to the percentage that are plain, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Checkered: 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain: 2/4 = 50%\n\nRatio would be 1:1, but again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question is only concerned with the phenotypic ratios of the F2 generation, not the entire population. For instance, in F2, each bird has a 25% chance of each genotype. So, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the number of each phenotype.\n\nAs established earlier, each phenotype corresponds to one of the four genotypes, so each should occur 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't reflected in the answer choices. \n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, summing to 16\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3, summing to 16\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, summing to 16\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1, summing to 16\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4, summing to 16\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2, summing to 16\n\nLooking at these, the most plausible option based on my earlier reasoning (assuming 1:1:1:1) isn't present. However, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs once, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Since this isn't an option, I must consider that perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of F2 individuals that are either checkered or plain, regardless of color, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only one trait, e.g., red color irrespective of brown, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, where each trait is independent, but the way the options are structured suggests a different calculation. For example, if the question is only considering the percentage of each phenotype relative to others, perhaps it's taking into account only one trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for a single trait, say pigmentation, ignoring color. In that case, each bird has a 50% chance of being checkered or plain, regardless of color. But that would mean a 1:1 ratio for pigmentation, and similarly for color. But this isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the F2 generation for the pigmentation trait, with brown and red being separate traits under pigmentation control. Wait, but the problem specifies that the colors are determined by B and b, so perhaps it's considering the color trait alone.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). So perhaps the question is considering the color trait, ignoring pigment. In that case, the F2 generation would have a phenotypic ratio based on the pigment color, with each bird having a 50% chance of being checkered or plain, regardless of color. But that doesn't explain the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering one trait, say the pigment color, and the bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment, regardless of the other trait. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio for pigmentation would be 3:1 (3/4 checkered, 1/4 plain), but the options suggest a different distribution.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me summarize my findings:\n\n- Each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n- Each genotype corresponds to a unique phenotype: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n- Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this. Therefore, I must conclude that I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not asking about the overall ratio but the ratio within the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only certain combinations. For example, if the question is asking about the ratio of birds that are either checkered OR plain, regardless of color, then:\n\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Thus, the ratio would be 1:1, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for each specific trait, considering only one trait. For example, the ratio of checkered to plain for pigment color, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Phenotype: Checkered (50%) vs Plain (50%), so 1:1. Again, not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation for each possible combination of traits, considering the presence of dominant alleles. But that brings us back to the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match my conclusion, perhaps I should re-express the question's expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question's structure. Let me try to compute the phenotypic ratios as per the options provided.\n\nLooking at Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nAssuming that in the F2 generation, the number of checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 3. Adding these up gives 1+3+9+3=16. This suggests that the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a binomial distribution with n=4 trials, but that's not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait, say pigment color, and the bird's phenotype is determined by whether they are checkered or plain, ignoring color. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation for the pigment color trait alone, with the number of checkered and plain birds in a 3:1 ratio. But again, this doesn't fit the options.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's genotype ratios, not the phenotypic ratios. For example, the number of checkered red, checkered brown, etc., as per the F2 genotype counts. But the question specifically asks for phenotypic ratios.\n\nAt this point, I realize that I might have misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the F2 generation is being considered in terms of the number of birds that are either checkered or plain, regardless of color. In that case:\n\n- Number of checkered birds: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Number of plain birds: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Ratio: 1:1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait, say pigment color, and expressing the ratio as the number of birds with checkered vs plain, ignoring color. In that case:\n\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain (regardless of color): 2/4 = 50%\n- Ratio: 1:1\n\nAgain, not matching any option.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer was option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, which represents a 1:3:9:3 ratio, suggesting a binomial distribution with n=4 trials, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated, and the options should reflect the 1:1:1:1 ratio instead.\n\nSince none",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

So, for example, a bird could be plain (c) and brown (B), or red (C) and brown (B), etc. Wait, but according to the given, C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will display both traits. Let me approach this differently. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So for pigment color (C), a bird is red if it has at least one C allele, else plain. Similarly, for color (B), a bird is brown if at least one B allele is present, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4.

Let me create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The parents are F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb). Each F1 can produce gametes CB and cb. When crossed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's for the F2 generation. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nFor each F2 bird, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles for pigment and color are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CC: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n- Cc: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n- cc: c is recessive \u2192 Plain\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Plain and Brown\n- bb: b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Checkered and Brown\n- Additionally, if both genes are recessive, then:\n  - C: c \u2192 Plain\n  - B: b \u2192 Checkered\n    Phenotype: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, a bird is considered to have the dominant trait for a gene if it has at least one dominant allele for that gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - If at least one C \u2192 Pigment red\n  - Else \u2192 Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - If at least one B \u2192 Brown\n  - Else \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, each bird can have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nLet's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach F2 bird is produced by a combination of gametes from each parent. The possible phenotypes depend on the alleles inherited from each parent.\n\nAlternatively, since the F2 generation is derived from the F1 (which was CcBb), the phenotypic ratio can be determined by evaluating each possible F2 genotype and mapping it to a phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that for each gene, the probability of each trait is:\n\n- For pigment (C): \n  - Probability of Pigment red = 1 (since any C gives red)\n  - Probability of Plain = 0 (since recessive c)\n- For color (B):\n  - Probability of Brown = 1\n  - Probability of Checkered = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply every bird has both traits, which isn't the case. Instead, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits. So, for pigment color, a bird is Pigment red if it has at least one C allele; otherwise, Plain. Similarly, for color, a bird is Brown if at least one B allele is present; otherwise, Checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene's contribution to the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n- Probability = P(Pigment red) * P(Color brown)\n  - P(Pigment red) = 1 (since C is dominant)\n  - P(Color brown) = 1 (since B is dominant)\n  - So, Phenotype 1 occurs with probability 1*1=1\n\nWait, that can't be right because it suggests all birds would have both traits, but in reality, some birds may not have one trait without the other. However, since both traits are expressed based on the presence of dominant alleles, any bird with a dominant allele for either trait will have that trait expressed. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be Pigment red regardless of the color trait. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be Brown regardless of pigment.\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let's take a different approach. For each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- Pigment red: At least one C\n- Brown: At least one B\n- Plain: No C (cc)\n- Checkered: No B (bb)\n\nSo, for each F2 bird:\n\n- If they have at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- If they have at least one C and no B \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- If they have no C and at least one B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- If they have neither C nor B \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing, where each F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nThe Punnett square for the F2 generation would look like this:\n\n```\n          CcBb    |    CcBb\n        ---------------\n        CB     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        cb     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        CB     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        cb     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n```\n\nBut instead, considering the actual F2 generation, it's better to list all possible combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nHowever, a quicker way is to realize that each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Let's list all four possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc (25%): Pigment red and Brown\n3. cc (25%): Plain and Brown\n4. bb (25%): Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each F2 bird inherits two alleles from each parent, so the possible genotypes aren't just CC, Cc, cc, bb; rather, they involve combinations of the two genes. Let me correct that.\n\nEach F2 bird is determined by the combination of alleles from the two parents. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - From Parent 1: C or c\n  - From Parent 2: C or c\n- For color (B):\n  - From Parent 1: B or b\n  - From Parent 2: B or b\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square properly:\n\n```\n               Parent 2\n              B      b\n             ------\n           C | CB | cb\n             ------\n           c | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for a single gene. For two genes, it's a bit more complex. Let me represent the F2 generation correctly.\n\nEach F2 bird has two alleles for pigment (C/c) and two alleles for color (B/b). The possible combinations are:\n\n- For pigment: CC, Cc, cC, cc\n- For color: BB, Bb, bB, bb\n\nBut since alleles are passed independently, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird, we look at both genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. plain (cc) and brown (B)\n4. plain (cc) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, let's count how many of the 16 possible F2 genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nEach F2 bird has a 1/4 chance of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC\n- 1/4 Cc\n- 1/4 cC\n- 1/4 cc\n\nAnd similarly for color:\n\n- 1/4 BB\n- 1/4 Bb\n- 1/4 bB\n- 1/4 bb\n\nBut since the genes are independent, we can combine these probabilities. However, to get the phenotypic distribution, we need to sum the probabilities of each phenotype occurring.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 All genotypes where at least one C and at least one B.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014Pigment red requires at least one C, but color checkered requires at least one b. So, the phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered only if the bird has at least one C but no B.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (rr, rR, Rr, RR) \u2192 Only if the bird has no C but at least one B.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (rr, rR, Rr, RR) \u2192 Only if the bird has neither C nor B.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible F2 genotypes: 16 (each gene has 4 possibilities, so 4x4=16)\n\nCompute the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\nNumber of such genotypes:\n- For pigment: Cc, CC (2 genotypes)\n- For color: Bb, BB (2 genotypes)\nBut since they are independent, the total is (number of pigment genotypes) * (number of color genotypes).\nWait, no\u2014each bird is determined by both genes, so the number of phenotypes is the product of the number of genotypes for each trait.\n\nActually, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, the number of phenotypes is the same as the number of possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nIn this case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n- Occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present.\nPossible genotypes: CC, Cc, cC, BB, Bb, bB, CB, BC\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating this. Let's use a table approach.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C present: C, C (for each color)\n- c present: c, c\n\nFor color (B):\n- B present: B, B\n- b present: b, b\n\nThe phenotypes depend on both traits. Let's enumerate all 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n11. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n12. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n13. cB BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n14. cB Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n15. cB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n16. cB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\nNow, let's categorize these:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (cases 1-6,9-12,13-14,15-16?) Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, cases 1-6 are Pigment red and Brown\nCases 7-8 are Pigment red and Checkered\nCases 9-12 are Plain and Brown\nCases 13-14 are Plain and Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Cases 7-8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Cases 9-12 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain and Checkered: Cases 13-14-15-16 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, but in our enumeration above, case 12 is cB bb \u2192 which is Pigment red and Checkered\nCase 13: cB BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nCase 14: cB Bb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nCase 15: cB bb \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nCase 16: cB bb \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, re-examining:\n\nFrom 1-6: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 6 cases\n7-8: Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 2 cases\n9-12: Plain and Brown \u2192 4 cases\n13-16: Plain and Checkered \u2192 4 cases\n\nYes, that makes sense because:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present): 6 cases\n- Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (b present): 2 cases\n- Plain (no C) and Brown (B present): 4 cases\n- Plain (no C) and Checkered (b present): 4 cases\n\nNow, the total is 6+2+4+4=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating this into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 6/16 = 3/8\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain and Brown: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 4/16 = 1/4\n\nWait, but looking at the options given:\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, my calculation shows:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 6 (3/8)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 2 (1/8)\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (1/4)\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (1/4)\n\nBut none of the options directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 3:1:3:1 (phenotypes in order)\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 2.25:1.125:1.125:0.25\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 0.1875:0.375:0.0278:0.1125\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 3:0.5:0.5:0.5\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not sure\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Hmm\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 0.125:0.375:0.09375:0.0625\n\nNone of these match my calculation exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the phenotypes.\n\nWait, in my initial categorization, I thought that:\n\nPigment red and Brown: 6 cases\nPigment red and Checkered: 2 cases\nPlain and Brown: 4 cases\nPlain and Checkered: 4 cases\n\nThat sums up to 16. But looking back, the option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems different from what I got. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the question mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Oh! Wait, in the original description, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant, so checkered would be any bird with at least one C allele, while plain is determined by recessive c. Wait, but earlier I thought checkered was when both alleles are recessive (cc). But now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the terminology. Let me clarify: In standard terminology, checkered refers to a dark coloration, often due to the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles, i.e., heterozygotes. Plain is the recessive phenotype, typically when both alleles are recessive (cc). So",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, the presence of one trait does not prevent the presence of another. So, for example, a bird could be plain (c) and brown (B), or red (C) and brown (B), etc. Wait, but according to the given, C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will display both traits. Let me approach this differently. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So for pigment color (C), a bird is red if it has at least one C allele, else plain. Similarly, for color (B), a bird is brown if at least one B allele is present, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of a dominant allele being present is 1, recessive is 0, but since it's a dihybrid cross, we'll consider the combined probabilities across both genes.\n\nWait, but since the genes are acting independently, the probabilities multiply. Let me create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The parents are F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb). Each F1 can produce gametes CB and cb. When crossed, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that's for the F2 generation. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nFor each F2 bird, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles for pigment and color are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CC: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n- Cc: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n- cc: c is recessive \u2192 Plain\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Plain and Brown\n- bb: b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n  - B: B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n    Phenotype: Checkered and Brown\n- Additionally, if both genes are recessive, then:\n  - C: c \u2192 Plain\n  - B: b \u2192 Checkered\n    Phenotype: Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, a bird is considered to have the dominant trait for a gene if it has at least one dominant allele for that gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - If at least one C \u2192 Pigment red\n  - Else \u2192 Plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - If at least one B \u2192 Brown\n  - Else \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, each bird can have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nLet's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach F2 bird is produced by a combination of gametes from each parent. The possible phenotypes depend on the alleles inherited from each parent.\n\nAlternatively, since the F2 generation is derived from the F1 (which was CcBb), the phenotypic ratio can be determined by evaluating each possible F2 genotype and mapping it to a phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that for each gene, the probability of each trait is:\n\n- For pigment (C): \n  - Probability of Pigment red = 1 (since any C gives red)\n  - Probability of Plain = 0 (since recessive c)\n- For color (B):\n  - Probability of Brown = 1\n  - Probability of Checkered = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply every bird has both traits, which isn't the case. Instead, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits. So, for pigment color, a bird is Pigment red if it has at least one C allele; otherwise, Plain. Similarly, for color, a bird is Brown if at least one B allele is present; otherwise, Checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene's contribution to the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n- Probability = P(Pigment red) * P(Color brown)\n  - P(Pigment red) = 1 (since C is dominant)\n  - P(Color brown) = 1 (since B is dominant)\n  - So, Phenotype 1 occurs with probability 1*1=1\n\nWait, that can't be right because it suggests all birds would have both traits, but in reality, some birds may not have one trait without the other. However, since both traits are expressed based on the presence of dominant alleles, any bird with a dominant allele for either trait will have that trait expressed. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will be Pigment red regardless of the color trait. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will be Brown regardless of pigment.\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let's take a different approach. For each F2 bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- Pigment red: At least one C\n- Brown: At least one B\n- Plain: No C (cc)\n- Checkered: No B (bb)\n\nSo, for each F2 bird:\n\n- If they have at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n- If they have at least one C and no B \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n- If they have no C and at least one B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- If they have neither C nor B \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing, where each F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nThe Punnett square for the F2 generation would look like this:\n\n```\n          CcBb    |    CcBb\n        ---------------\n        CB     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        cb     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        CB     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n        cb     |       CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n```\n\nBut instead, considering the actual F2 generation, it's better to list all possible combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nHowever, a quicker way is to realize that each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Let's list all four possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Pigment red and Brown\n2. Cc (25%): Pigment red and Brown\n3. cc (25%): Plain and Brown\n4. bb (25%): Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each F2 bird inherits two alleles from each parent, so the possible genotypes aren't just CC, Cc, cc, bb; rather, they involve combinations of the two genes. Let me correct that.\n\nEach F2 bird is determined by the combination of alleles from the two parents. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the possible combinations are:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - From Parent 1: C or c\n  - From Parent 2: C or c\n- For color (B):\n  - From Parent 1: B or b\n  - From Parent 2: B or b\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square properly:\n\n```\n               Parent 2\n              B      b\n             ------\n           C | CB | cb\n             ------\n           c | cB | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for a single gene. For two genes, it's a bit more complex. Let me represent the F2 generation correctly.\n\nEach F2 bird has two alleles for pigment (C/c) and two alleles for color (B/b). The possible combinations are:\n\n- For pigment: CC, Cc, cC, cc\n- For color: BB, Bb, bB, bb\n\nBut since alleles are passed independently, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird, we look at both genes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. plain (cc) and brown (B)\n4. plain (cc) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, let's count how many of the 16 possible F2 genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nEach F2 bird has a 1/4 chance of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC\n- 1/4 Cc\n- 1/4 cC\n- 1/4 cc\n\nAnd similarly for color:\n\n- 1/4 BB\n- 1/4 Bb\n- 1/4 bB\n- 1/4 bb\n\nBut since the genes are independent, we can combine these probabilities. However, to get the phenotypic distribution, we need to sum the probabilities of each phenotype occurring.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 All genotypes where at least one C and at least one B.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014Pigment red requires at least one C, but color checkered requires at least one b. So, the phenotype is Pigment red and Checkered only if the bird has at least one C but no B.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (rr, rR, Rr, RR) \u2192 Only if the bird has no C but at least one B.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (rr, rR, Rr, RR) \u2192 Only if the bird has neither C nor B.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible F2 genotypes: 16 (each gene has 4 possibilities, so 4x4=16)\n\nCompute the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\nNumber of such genotypes:\n- For pigment: Cc, CC (2 genotypes)\n- For color: Bb, BB (2 genotypes)\nBut since they are independent, the total is (number of pigment genotypes) * (number of color genotypes).\nWait, no\u2014each bird is determined by both genes, so the number of phenotypes is the product of the number of genotypes for each trait.\n\nActually, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, the number of phenotypes is the same as the number of possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nIn this case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n- Occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present.\nPossible genotypes: CC, Cc, cC, BB, Bb, bB, CB, BC\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating this. Let's use a table approach.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C present: C, C (for each color)\n- c present: c, c\n\nFor color (B):\n- B present: B, B\n- b present: b, b\n\nThe phenotypes depend on both traits. Let's enumerate all 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n8. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n11. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n12. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n13. cB BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n14. cB Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n15. cB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n16. cB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\nNow, let's categorize these:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (cases 1-6,9-12,13-14,15-16?) Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, cases 1-6 are Pigment red and Brown\nCases 7-8 are Pigment red and Checkered\nCases 9-12 are Plain and Brown\nCases 13-14 are Plain and Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Cases 7-8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain and Brown: Cases 9-12 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain and Checkered: Cases 13-14-15-16 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, but in our enumeration above, case 12 is cB bb \u2192 which is Pigment red and Checkered\nCase 13: cB BB \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nCase 14: cB Bb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nCase 15: cB bb \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nCase 16: cB bb \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, re-examining:\n\nFrom 1-6: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 6 cases\n7-8: Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 2 cases\n9-12: Plain and Brown \u2192 4 cases\n13-16: Plain and Checkered \u2192 4 cases\n\nYes, that makes sense because:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present): 6 cases\n- Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (b present): 2 cases\n- Plain (no C) and Brown (B present): 4 cases\n- Plain (no C) and Checkered (b present): 4 cases\n\nNow, the total is 6+2+4+4=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating this into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 6/16 = 3/8\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain and Brown: 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 4/16 = 1/4\n\nWait, but looking at the options given:\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, my calculation shows:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 6 (3/8)\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 2 (1/8)\n- Plain and Brown: 4 (1/4)\n- Plain and Checkered: 4 (1/4)\n\nBut none of the options directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 3:1:3:1 (phenotypes in order)\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 2.25:1.125:1.125:0.25\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 0.1875:0.375:0.0278:0.1125\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 3:0.5:0.5:0.5\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not sure\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Hmm\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 0.125:0.375:0.09375:0.0625\n\nNone of these match my calculation exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the phenotypes.\n\nWait, in my initial categorization, I thought that:\n\nPigment red and Brown: 6 cases\nPigment red and Checkered: 2 cases\nPlain and Brown: 4 cases\nPlain and Checkered: 4 cases\n\nThat sums up to 16. But looking back, the option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems different from what I got. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the question mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Oh! Wait, in the original description, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which is dominant, so checkered would be any bird with at least one C allele, while plain is determined by recessive c. Wait, but earlier I thought checkered was when both alleles are recessive (cc). But now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the terminology. Let me clarify: In standard terminology, checkered refers to a dark coloration, often due to the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles, i.e., heterozygotes. Plain is the recessive phenotype, typically when both alleles are recessive (cc). So",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So for each bird:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Phenotype 1: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nWait, but since each bird must have both traits unless one is missing. Wait, no\u2014that's not how probability works. The probability of having both traits is the product of each being dominant. But in reality, each bird's traits are determined independently. So the chance that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the chance that it has brown is also 1 (any B gives brown). Thus, the chance of both traits is 1*1=1, which seems impossible. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will have both traits, which contradicts the idea of dominance. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says that the checkered pattern is due to a dominant gene C and recessive c. Red is due to B, and brown is due to b. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will express those traits. Wait, but that's not quite accurate. Actually, for each trait, the presence of the dominant allele results in the expressed trait. So for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red; else, it'll be plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown; else, checkered. So the phenotype of each bird is a combination where each trait is expressed if the corresponding allele is present. Therefore, for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 if C and B are both present (i.e., at least one C and at least one B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 if C is present and B is absent\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 if C is absent and B is present\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 if both C and B are absent\n\nSo now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, determine the probabilities for each gene:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (since any C gives red, regardless of other alleles)\n  - Probability of c (recessive) = 0 (since the bird must have at least one C to express red)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. So the probability of having pigment red is 1, and the probability of being plain is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nTherefore, the phenotype probabilities are determined by the presence of both dominant alleles. Since both traits are always expressed (because both alleles are dominant), every bird will have both traits. But that's not realistic because dominance usually refers to the expression of the trait when a certain allele is present. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in that trait being expressed. In that case, all birds will have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, which isn't among the options. This suggests I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me reread the problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that part was already clarified earlier. So the checkered pattern is due to C, and plain is due to c. For color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nPerhaps the key here is that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, and the number of such alleles determines the phenotype. So for pigment color, the presence of at least one C makes it red; otherwise, it's plain. For body color, presence of at least one B makes it brown; otherwise, it's checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 if at least one C and at least one B\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 if at least one C and no B\n3. Plain (no C) and brown (B) \u2192 if no C and at least one B\n4. Plain (no C) and checkered (b) \u2192 if no C and no B\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible gametes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their offspring will receive one allele from each parent. From the CC parent, they can only give C. From the cc parent, they can only give c. Therefore, all offspring will be Cc, and their genotype will be Cc. Now, looking at the coat colors:\n\n- For pigment color (C): C is dominant, so all offspring will have pigment red.\n- For body color (B): Since the bird has only c alleles, it cannot express the B allele. Therefore, all offspring will be plain.\n\nThus, all offspring will have red pigment and plain body color, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states that the first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant) and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Therefore, their F1 would all be CcBb, and their F2 would all be CcBb as well. But according to my previous analysis, all would have C and c, leading to red and plain, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the parents are different. Wait, the problem specifies a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and their F2 would be CcBb as well. But given the analysis above, all would have red and plain, hence a 100% phenotypic ratio. However, this doesn't match any of the answer choices, which suggests I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Maybe the first parent is CC (for pigment) and BB (for body), while the second parent is cc (for pigment) and bb (for body). Therefore, their F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (body), and F2 would be a mix of Cc and Bb. Then, the F2 would include all possible combinations of C/B and c/b alleles, leading to the various phenotypes. Let me try this approach.\n\nParent 1: CC (pigment) x bb (pigment)\nParent 2: BB (body) x cc (body)\n\nWait, no\u2014that would imply a dihybrid cross without the recessive letters. Let me clarify. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are homozygous. The second parent is cc bb, meaning both genes are homozygous recessive. Therefore, their F1 would all be CcBb, and F2 would all be CcBb. As before, all offspring would have C (pigment red) and c (body plain), so all would express red pigment and plain body color, giving a 100% phenotype ratio. But this still doesn't align with the answer choices, which involve multiple phenotypes.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps the first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are dominant, and the second parent is cc bb, meaning both are recessive. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb as well, but this leads to all having red and plain, which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Perhaps the first parent is CC (pigment) and BB (body), and the second is cc (pigment) and bb (body). So their F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (body), and F2 would include all combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following possibilities:\n\n- CcBb (both dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb (c recessive, B dominant) \u2192 Plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n- CcBb (both recessive) \u2192 Plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C will have pigment red, and any bird with at least one B will have brown. Checkered is only shown when both C and B are present (i.e., B is recessive only if C is present, but since C is dominant, any C would mean pigment red regardless of B).\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify: the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): Yes, so red\n- Plain (c): No, so plain\n- Brown (B): Yes, so brown\n- Checkered (b): No, so checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each trait is present:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered (C and B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSince all F2 individuals are CcBb (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization), each has a 25% chance of each phenotype. However, the actual counts depend on the number of eggs and sperm, but since we're dealing with a large population, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut this would lead to a 25% ratio for each phenotype, totaling 100%. However, none of the answer choices match this. The closest option is E: phenotypic ratio checkered red 3, plain brown 9, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each bird's coat color is determined by the presence of B (brown) and the presence of c (checkered). Wait, perhaps the problem considers that a bird is only brown if at least one B allele is present, and checkered only if both C and B are absent. Let me reevaluate.\n\nIf a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. If it has at least one C allele, it's red. Checkered is only when neither C nor B is present (i.e., c and b alleles). Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So for each bird:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Phenotype 1: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nWait, but since each bird must have both traits unless one is missing. Wait, no\u2014that's not how probability works. The probability of having both traits is the product of each being dominant. But in reality, each bird's traits are determined independently. So the chance that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and the chance that it has brown is also 1 (any B gives brown). Thus, the chance of both traits is 1*1=1, which seems impossible. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will have both traits, which contradicts the idea of dominance. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says that the checkered pattern is due to a dominant gene C and recessive c. Red is due to B, and brown is due to b. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will express those traits. Wait, but that's not quite accurate. Actually, for each trait, the presence of the dominant allele results in the expressed trait. So for pigment color, if the bird has at least one C allele, it'll be red; else, it'll be plain. Similarly, for body color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown; else, checkered. So the phenotype of each bird is a combination where each trait is expressed if the corresponding allele is present. Therefore, for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 if C and B are both present (i.e., at least one C and at least one B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 if C is present and B is absent\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 if C is absent and B is present\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 if both C and B are absent\n\nSo now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, determine the probabilities for each gene:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Probability of C (dominant) = 1 (since any C gives red, regardless of other alleles)\n  - Probability of c (recessive) = 0 (since the bird must have at least one C to express red)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one C, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. So the probability of having pigment red is 1, and the probability of being plain is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 1\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 0\n\nTherefore, the phenotype probabilities are determined by the presence of both dominant alleles. Since both traits are always expressed (because both alleles are dominant), every bird will have both traits. But that's not realistic because dominance usually refers to the expression of the trait when a certain allele is present. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in that trait being expressed. In that case, all birds will have both traits, making the phenotypic ratio 100%, which isn't among the options. This suggests I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me reread the problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that part was already clarified earlier. So the checkered pattern is due to C, and plain is due to c. For color, B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nPerhaps the key here is that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, and the number of such alleles determines the phenotype. So for pigment color, the presence of at least one C makes it red; otherwise, it's plain. For body color, presence of at least one B makes it brown; otherwise, it's checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 if at least one C and at least one B\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 if at least one C and no B\n3. Plain (no C) and brown (B) \u2192 if no C and at least one B\n4. Plain (no C) and checkered (b) \u2192 if no C and no B\n\nGiven that, let's model the possible gametes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their offspring will receive one allele from each parent. From the CC parent, they can only give C. From the cc parent, they can only give c. Therefore, all offspring will be Cc, and their genotype will be Cc. Now, looking at the coat colors:\n\n- For pigment color (C): C is dominant, so all offspring will have pigment red.\n- For body color (B): Since the bird has only c alleles, it cannot express the B allele. Therefore, all offspring will be plain.\n\nThus, all offspring will have red pigment and plain body color, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous for both genes. Wait, the problem states that the first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant) and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Therefore, their F1 would all be CcBb, and their F2 would all be CcBb as well. But according to my previous analysis, all would have C and c, leading to red and plain, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the parents are different. Wait, the problem specifies a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and their F2 would be CcBb as well. But given the analysis above, all would have red and plain, hence a 100% phenotypic ratio. However, this doesn't match any of the answer choices, which suggests I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Maybe the first parent is CC (for pigment) and BB (for body), while the second parent is cc (for pigment) and bb (for body). Therefore, their F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (body), and F2 would be a mix of Cc and Bb. Then, the F2 would include all possible combinations of C/B and c/b alleles, leading to the various phenotypes. Let me try this approach.\n\nParent 1: CC (pigment) x bb (pigment)\nParent 2: BB (body) x cc (body)\n\nWait, no\u2014that would imply a dihybrid cross without the recessive letters. Let me clarify. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are homozygous. The second parent is cc bb, meaning both genes are homozygous recessive. Therefore, their F1 would all be CcBb, and F2 would all be CcBb. As before, all offspring would have C (pigment red) and c (body plain), so all would express red pigment and plain body color, giving a 100% phenotype ratio. But this still doesn't align with the answer choices, which involve multiple phenotypes.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps the first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are dominant, and the second parent is cc bb, meaning both are recessive. Their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb as well, but this leads to all having red and plain, which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Perhaps the first parent is CC (pigment) and BB (body), and the second is cc (pigment) and bb (body). So their F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (body), and F2 would include all combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following possibilities:\n\n- CcBb (both dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb (c recessive, B dominant) \u2192 Plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n- CcBb (both recessive) \u2192 Plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C will have pigment red, and any bird with at least one B will have brown. Checkered is only shown when both C and B are present (i.e., B is recessive only if C is present, but since C is dominant, any C would mean pigment red regardless of B).\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify: the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the trait being expressed. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): Yes, so red\n- Plain (c): No, so plain\n- Brown (B): Yes, so brown\n- Checkered (b): No, so checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each trait is present:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered (C and B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSince all F2 individuals are CcBb (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization), each has a 25% chance of each phenotype. However, the actual counts depend on the number of eggs and sperm, but since we're dealing with a large population, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut this would lead to a 25% ratio for each phenotype, totaling 100%. However, none of the answer choices match this. The closest option is E: phenotypic ratio checkered red 3, plain brown 9, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each bird's coat color is determined by the presence of B (brown) and the presence of c (checkered). Wait, perhaps the problem considers that a bird is only brown if at least one B allele is present, and checkered only if both C and B are absent. Let me reevaluate.\n\nIf a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. If it has at least one C allele, it's red. Checkered is only when neither C nor B is present (i.e., c and b alleles). Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (B absent and C absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach with a 25% chance. So the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this. Looking back at the answer choices, option E is checkered red 3, plain brown 9, which doesn't add up to 100%. Option D is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is less than 100%.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total is 12, which is still less. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, total 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Sum to 16. Option B: 8, 4, 0, 4. Sum to 16. Option C: 9, 3, 3, 1. Sum to 16.\n\nNone of these sum to 100%, suggesting that perhaps the assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Perhaps the first parent is CC (pigment) and BB (body), while the second is cc (pigment) and bb (body). In this case, the F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (body), and the F2 would include all combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nIn this scenario, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (pigment red, body brown)\n- Cc (pigment red, body checkered)\n- cC (pigment plain, body brown)\n- cc (pigment plain, body checkered)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment red is dominant over plain\n- Body brown is dominant over checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (all C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in F2, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the answer choices reflect this. However, let's look at the answer choices again.\n\nLooking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, which is too low. Option E: checkered red 3, plain brown 9, which sums to 12. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Sum to 16. Option B: 8, 4, 0, 4. Sum to 16. Option C: 9, 3, 3, 1. Sum to 16. None of them add up to 100%. \n\nThis suggests that my initial approach is flawed, possibly because the parents are not both homozygous for both traits.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",

However, according to the given information, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each bird must exhibit both traits unless one trait masks the other.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So plain color (c) masks the pigment color (C), making the bird appear plain regardless of the pigment color. Similarly, brown (B) masks the checkered (b), so if a bird has b, it will appear checkered regardless of B.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires both C and B to be dominant.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Requires C dominant and b recessive.\n3. Plain and brown: Requires c recessive and B dominant.\n4. Plain and checkered: Requires c recessive and b recessive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb.

So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All birds with C and B will have both traits. So probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, but this can't be right because it suggests all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that one trait masks the other. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how dominance works here. Let me clarify: If a bird has C (p pigment red) and B (p brown), then both traits are expressed. If a bird has C and b, only the pigment is expressed (red), and the body is checkered (because b hides B). Similarly, if a bird has c (plain) and B, only B is expressed (brown), and c hides C. Only if both c and b are recessive would both traits be absent, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nSo the actual calculation should consider the following for each bird:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both pigment red and brown \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this isn't accurate because it ignores the masking)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.25 = 0.25\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 1 = 0.25\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one allele masks the other. So, for example, if a bird has C (p pigment red), regardless of B, it will appear red. Similarly, if it has B (brown), regardless of C, it will appear brown. Only if both are recessive (c and b) does it appear plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to compute the phenotypic ratios is to count the number of birds that fall into each category without considering dominance. Instead, we'll look at the possible combinations and assign them accordingly.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For each bird, determine the phenotype based on the combination of alleles.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/c):\n\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for body (B/b):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nEach combination of these will lead to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC + Bb \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3.

Instead, we need to count the number of birds that fit each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the list above:\n\nPhenotype 1: (CC and BB) \u2192 All birds where C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 How many?\n\nIn terms of probabilities:\n\n- P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 But this seems off because it assumes all birds meet this condition, which isn't true due to masking.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of possible combinations that result in each phenotype.\n\nEach bird's genotype for C and B can be represented as a pair (C, B), where C can be C or c, and B can be B or b.\n\nThere are 4 possible combinations:\n\n1. (C, B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. (C, b) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. (c, B) \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. (c, b) \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nSince C and B are independent:\n\n- P((C, B)) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 This doesn't seem right because it implies all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea of masking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The presence of one dominant allele masks the other. So for a bird to display both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each gene. However, depending on the combination, some phenotypes are impossible together.\n\nWait, actually, if a bird has C (dominant pigment red) and B (dominant brown), it will display both traits. If it has C and b (so checkered body), it will display pigment red but checkered body. Similarly, if it has c (plain) and B (brown), it will display brown body but plain pigment. Finally, if it has c and b, it will display both plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are indeed distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits, which is not possible. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. So the actual probabilities aren't straightforward multiplications. Instead, we need to consider all possible combinations and see which ones correspond to each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach it by listing all possible genotypic combinations and assigning them to phenotypes:\n\nTotal possible combinations for C (C/C, C/c, cc):\n- C/C: 25%\n- C/c: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B (BB, Bb, bb):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n1. C/C (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n2. C/C (pigment red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. C/C (pigment red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. C/c (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. C/c (pigment red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. C/c (pigment red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc (plain) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc (plain) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc (plain) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: All cases where either C or B is dominant. Looking at the combinations:\n- (C/C, BB) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (C/C, Bb) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- (C/c, BB) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- (C/c, Bb) \u2192 50% * 50% = 25%\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%\n\nPhenotype 2: Cases where C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- (cc, BB) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (cc, Bb) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 3: Cases where B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (C/C, C/c, cc)\n- (C/C, bb) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (C/c, bb) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 4: Cases where both B and C are recessive (cc and bb)\n- (cc, bb) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, adding up all phenotypes:\n\n56.25 (1) + 18.75 (2) + 18.75 (3) + 6.25 (4) = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Matches our calculation\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nEtc.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio 9, 3, 3, 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, the presence of one dominant allele may mask the effect of the other. However, according to the given information, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each bird must exhibit both traits unless one trait masks the other.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So plain color (c) masks the pigment color (C), making the bird appear plain regardless of the pigment color. Similarly, brown (B) masks the checkered (b), so if a bird has b, it will appear checkered regardless of B.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires both C and B to be dominant.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Requires C dominant and b recessive.\n3. Plain and brown: Requires c recessive and B dominant.\n4. Plain and checkered: Requires c recessive and b recessive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb. So the F2 will come from F1 selfing. The F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All birds with C and B will have both traits. So probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, but this can't be right because it suggests all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea that one trait masks the other. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how dominance works here. Let me clarify: If a bird has C (p pigment red) and B (p brown), then both traits are expressed. If a bird has C and b, only the pigment is expressed (red), and the body is checkered (because b hides B). Similarly, if a bird has c (plain) and B, only B is expressed (brown), and c hides C. Only if both c and b are recessive would both traits be absent, resulting in plain and checkered.\n\nSo the actual calculation should consider the following for each bird:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both pigment red and brown \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this isn't accurate because it ignores the masking)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.25 = 0.25\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 1 = 0.25\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one allele masks the other. So, for example, if a bird has C (p pigment red), regardless of B, it will appear red. Similarly, if it has B (brown), regardless of C, it will appear brown. Only if both are recessive (c and b) does it appear plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to compute the phenotypic ratios is to count the number of birds that fall into each category without considering dominance. Instead, we'll look at the possible combinations and assign them accordingly.\n\nLet me approach it differently. For each bird, determine the phenotype based on the combination of alleles.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/c):\n\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for body (B/b):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nEach combination of these will lead to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC + Bb \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3.

(c, b) \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nSince C and B are independent:\n\n- P((C, B)) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 This doesn't seem right because it implies all birds have both traits, which contradicts the idea of masking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The presence of one dominant allele masks the other. So for a bird to display both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each gene. However, depending on the combination, some phenotypes are impossible together.\n\nWait, actually, if a bird has C (dominant pigment red) and B (dominant brown), it will display both traits. If it has C and b (so checkered body), it will display pigment red but checkered body. Similarly, if it has c (plain) and B (brown), it will display brown body but plain pigment. Finally, if it has c and b, it will display both plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are indeed distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits, which is not possible. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, the presence of one dominant allele masks the effect of the other. So the actual probabilities aren't straightforward multiplications. Instead, we need to consider all possible combinations and see which ones correspond to each phenotype.\n\nLet me approach it by listing all possible genotypic combinations and assigning them to phenotypes:\n\nTotal possible combinations for C (C/C, C/c, cc):\n- C/C: 25%\n- C/c: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B (BB, Bb, bb):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n1. C/C (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown)\n2. C/C (pigment red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. C/C (pigment red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. C/c (pigment red) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. C/c (pigment red) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. C/c (pigment red) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc (plain) + BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc (plain) + Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc (plain) + bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, to calculate the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: All cases where either C or B is dominant. Looking at the combinations:\n- (C/C, BB) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (C/C, Bb) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- (C/c, BB) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- (C/c, Bb) \u2192 50% * 50% = 25%\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%\n\nPhenotype 2: Cases where C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- (cc, BB) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (cc, Bb) \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 3: Cases where B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (C/C, C/c, cc)\n- (C/C, bb) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- (C/c, bb) \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 = 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 4: Cases where both B and C are recessive (cc and bb)\n- (cc, bb) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, adding up all phenotypes:\n\n56.25 (1) + 18.75 (2) + 18.75 (3) + 6.25 (4) = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Not matching\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Matches our calculation\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nEtc.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio 9, 3, 3, 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But since all parents are either homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive, let's see:",
    "rollout": " But since all parents are either homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive, let's see:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both genes are dominant.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both genes are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes for each bird are:\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All offspring must have at least one dominant allele for both genes, so they'll be red-brown.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Impossible because the second parent is homozygous recessive for B (bb), so the bird cannot have brown.\nWait, hold on\u2014that\u2019s a mistake. The second parent is cc bb, so all offspring from F1 (CcBb) will have cc for the B gene (so no B) and bb for the b gene (so no b). Therefore, all offspring will have the same phenotype regarding the B gene\u2014they won\u2019t have brown. Similarly, since the first parent is CC BB, all offspring will have at least one dominant C and one dominant B, so they'll be red-brown. Therefore, all F2 birds will be red-brown. But that contradicts the given answer options where there are different ratios. Hmm, did I misunderstand something?\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided an initial setup with gametes for F1 as (CB)(cb). They then created an F1 cross as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But according to my earlier reasoning, all offspring should be red-brown because the parents don't provide B or b. Let me double-check: Parent 1 is CC BB \u2192 can only give CB. Parent 2 is cc bb \u2192 can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only give CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSince each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Red-Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain-Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain-Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain-Checkered\n\nSo now, let's count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation:\n\n- For Red-Brown: All birds have at least one dominant C and one dominant B. Since F1 is CcBb, all F2 will have CcBb, which includes C and B, so all are Red-Brown.\n- For Plain-Checkered: Only the cc (c) and bb (b) genotypes. From the F2, 25% are cc (all b), so all have b. Also, 25% are bb (all b), so those also have b. Additionally, the C locus is dominant, so all have C. Therefore, 50% of F2 are Plain-Checkered.\n- For Plain-Brown: These occur when C is recessive (cc) but B is dominant (B present). So, 25% of F2 are ccB_, which translates to Plain-Brown.\n- For Red-Checkered: These occur when both C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So, 25% of F2 are ccbb, which is Red-Checkered.\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nRed-Brown : Plain-Checkered : Plain-Brown : Red-Checkered = 100% : 50% : 25% : 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 200%, but since we're dealing with parts, let's express them as fractions:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/2\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Brown: 1/4\n- Red-Checkered: 1/4\n\nExpressed as parts, the ratio is 2:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly.

Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user provided an initial setup with gametes for F1 as (CB)(cb). Then they created an F1 \u00d7 F1 cross as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. In the subsequent section, the user presents a table of phenotypes and counts, such as \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nWait, that seems off because if all F2 are red-brown, how do they get different numbers? Did I misinterpret the F1 cross? Because if the F1 were recombinant, say CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, then the F2 would include all combinations, leading to different phenotypes. Maybe the user intended to use a different approach, but according to standard Mendelian analysis, the F2 should all be red-brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included an incorrect gamete distribution. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose the F1 gametes are indeed CB and cb, but perhaps the F1 itself is an error. Alternatively, maybe the user presented the F2 results incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different cross, such as between heterozygotes, but without clear instructions, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the answers, and the correct option isn't among them.\n\nGiven that none of the provided options (A to Z) match my calculations, it's possible that there was an error in the setup. However, based on the most logical interpretation, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% red-brown, with no plain or checkered birds. But since that's not among the options, perhaps the user intended a different cross or made a mistake in the answers.\n\nHowever, given the options, the closest plausible answer based on a different approach might be option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But why would that be the case? Maybe the user considered the F2 as having certain genotypic distributions. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination of these contributes to the overall phenotype. As previously determined, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Brown\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red-Brown\n- Cc bb: Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nCounting these:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 (25%) \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nTotaling:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4 \u2192 75%\n- Plain-Brown: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Red-Checkered: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n\nThis still sums to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking back at the options, the closest one that matches 2:1:1:1 ratio (which would correspond to 100% Red-Brown, 50% Plain-Checkered, 25% Plain-Brown, 25% Red-Checkered) is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different cross or made a mistake in the answers.\n\nGiven that, and since none of the options align perfectly with my calculations, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only certain phenotypic expressions. However, without further clarification, it's challenging to proceed accurately. Based on my analysis, the correct ratio shouldn't be among the provided options, suggesting a possible error in the question or the provided answers.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But since all parents are either homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive, let's see:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both genes are dominant.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both genes are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes for each bird are:\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All offspring must have at least one dominant allele for both genes, so they'll be red-brown.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Impossible because the second parent is homozygous recessive for B (bb), so the bird cannot have brown.\nWait, hold on\u2014that\u2019s a mistake. The second parent is cc bb, so all offspring from F1 (CcBb) will have cc for the B gene (so no B) and bb for the b gene (so no b). Therefore, all offspring will have the same phenotype regarding the B gene\u2014they won\u2019t have brown. Similarly, since the first parent is CC BB, all offspring will have at least one dominant C and one dominant B, so they'll be red-brown. Therefore, all F2 birds will be red-brown. But that contradicts the given answer options where there are different ratios. Hmm, did I misunderstand something?\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided an initial setup with gametes for F1 as (CB)(cb). They then created an F1 cross as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But according to my earlier reasoning, all offspring should be red-brown because the parents don't provide B or b. Let me double-check: Parent 1 is CC BB \u2192 can only give CB. Parent 2 is cc bb \u2192 can only give cb. So F1 (CcBb) can only give CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSince each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Red-Brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain-Checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain-Brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain-Checkered\n\nSo now, let's count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation:\n\n- For Red-Brown: All birds have at least one dominant C and one dominant B. Since F1 is CcBb, all F2 will have CcBb, which includes C and B, so all are Red-Brown.\n- For Plain-Checkered: Only the cc (c) and bb (b) genotypes. From the F2, 25% are cc (all b), so all have b. Also, 25% are bb (all b), so those also have b. Additionally, the C locus is dominant, so all have C. Therefore, 50% of F2 are Plain-Checkered.\n- For Plain-Brown: These occur when C is recessive (cc) but B is dominant (B present). So, 25% of F2 are ccB_, which translates to Plain-Brown.\n- For Red-Checkered: These occur when both C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So, 25% of F2 are ccbb, which is Red-Checkered.\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nRed-Brown : Plain-Checkered : Plain-Brown : Red-Checkered = 100% : 50% : 25% : 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 200%, but since we're dealing with parts, let's express them as fractions:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/2\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain-Brown: 1/4\n- Red-Checkered: 1/4\n\nExpressed as parts, the ratio is 2:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Not matching our calculations.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nK. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nL. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nM. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nN. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nO. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nP. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nQ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nR. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nS. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nT. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nU. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nV. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nW. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nX. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nY. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nZ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2192 No.\n\nNone of the options A to Z seem to match our calculated ratios. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user provided an initial setup with gametes for F1 as (CB)(cb). Then they created an F1 \u00d7 F1 cross as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. In the subsequent section, the user presents a table of phenotypes and counts, such as \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nWait, that seems off because if all F2 are red-brown, how do they get different numbers? Did I misinterpret the F1 cross? Because if the F1 were recombinant, say CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, then the F2 would include all combinations, leading to different phenotypes. Maybe the user intended to use a different approach, but according to standard Mendelian analysis, the F2 should all be red-brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included an incorrect gamete distribution. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose the F1 gametes are indeed CB and cb, but perhaps the F1 itself is an error. Alternatively, maybe the user presented the F2 results incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different cross, such as between heterozygotes, but without clear instructions, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the answers, and the correct option isn't among them.\n\nGiven that none of the provided options (A to Z) match my calculations, it's possible that there was an error in the setup. However, based on the most logical interpretation, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 100% red-brown, with no plain or checkered birds. But since that's not among the options, perhaps the user intended a different cross or made a mistake in the answers.\n\nHowever, given the options, the closest plausible answer based on a different approach might be option G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But why would that be the case? Maybe the user considered the F2 as having certain genotypic distributions. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination of these contributes to the overall phenotype. As previously determined, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: Red-Brown\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- CC bb: Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red-Brown\n- Cc bb: Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nCounting these:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 (25%) \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- Cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nTotaling:\n\n- Red-Brown: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4 \u2192 75%\n- Plain-Brown: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Red-Checkered: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n\nThis still sums to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking back at the options, the closest one that matches 2:1:1:1 ratio (which would correspond to 100% Red-Brown, 50% Plain-Checkered, 25% Plain-Brown, 25% Red-Checkered) is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the user intended a different cross or made a mistake in the answers.\n\nGiven that, and since none of the options align perfectly with my calculations, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only certain phenotypic expressions. However, without further clarification, it's challenging to proceed accurately. Based on my analysis, the correct ratio shouldn't be among the provided options, suggesting a possible error in the question or the provided answers.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but that seems incorrect because the actual probability isn't 1. Oh, wait\u2014I'm making a mistake here. The probability that a bird has both traits is the product of the probabilities that each gene contributes the dominant allele. Since both genes are dominant, the probability is indeed 1, but that's not correct because it's impossible for all birds to have both traits unless all their alleles are dominant. Wait, no\u2014that's not true. Each bird has two copies of each gene. So for example, for the C gene, each bird has two alleles. If both are C, then pigment is red. If one is C and one is c, then pigment is red. Only when both are c does the bird have plain. Similarly for B. Therefore, the probability of a bird expressing both traits (pigment red and brown) is the probability that both C and B are dominant. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present). But wait, the presence of C being dominant is always expressed as red, and presence of B as dominant as brown. So regardless of the alleles, the bird will have both traits. Wait, that can't be right because some birds might have only one dominant trait if the other is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if neither gene is dominant, i.e., if both are recessive. So the phenotypes possible are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, but according to the given options, the answer choices don't include four phenotypes. Let me see the options: A through H, each lists specific phenotypic ratios. Option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that makes four phenotypes, and the numbers add up to 16 (1+3+9+3=16). So that must be the correct approach.\n\nNow, the next step is to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll look at the F1 generation and see what they can produce. The F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, produces F2. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, the gametes would be CB and cb because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce 50% CB and 50% cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be: CC BB (25%), CcBb (50%), and cc bb (25%).\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Both C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc bb: Both c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's not matching my earlier thought process. Because CcBb would still have both traits expressed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CcBb: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red; B is dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n- CC BB: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red; B is dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 Same as above\n- cc bb: C is recessive \u2192 Plain; B is recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n- CcBb: Same as before \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes, the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% Pigment red, Brown\n- 25% Plain, Checkered\n- 50% Pigment red, Brown\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but looking at the options, none of them list two phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user included a long list of possible answers, including various ratios. One of the options is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Another is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Let me go back and recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try a different approach. The F1 is CcBb. When it self-fertilizes, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo, the F2 population has 25% Pigment red, Brown; 50% Pigment red, Brown; and 25% Plain, Checkered. Combining the first two groups, Pigment red, Brown represents 75% of the population, while Plain, Checkered is 25%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly match this except for option E, which mentions checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's adding up to 16 birds, with 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. This seems inconsistent with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem description. Let me read it again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by a dominant gene C. So, the presence of C determines the pattern, and the absence (c) determines the color. Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by a dominant gene C, so any bird with at least one C allele will have the checkered pattern, and the presence of a dominant B allele will cause brown color, while the presence of a dominant c allele will cause plain color.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The problem states: \"The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of the dominant C allele causes the checkered pattern, and the presence of the recessive c allele causes plain color. Additionally, the presence of the dominant B allele causes brown color, and the recessive b allele causes checkered color.\n\nWait, now that changes things. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by two traits: the pattern (C vs. c) and the color (B vs. b). So, the pattern is determined by the presence of at least one dominant C allele. The color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele. So:\n\n- Pattern: Checkered (C present) or Plain (c present)\n- Color: Brown (B present) or Checkered (b present)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n\nWait, but this is similar to what I thought earlier, leading to four phenotypes. But the options don't have four phenotypes. Instead, all the options involve four phenotypes, but with varying ratios.\n\nLet me proceed with the correct understanding:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern (C) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern (c) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nWait, but the third and fourth points are actually the same as point 2 and 1, respectively. So, the correct classification is:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n\nThis still results in four phenotypes. However, looking back at the options, option E lists four phenotypes: checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, but how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem refers to two separate traits: pigment color (B/Bb) and checkered pattern (C/Cc). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let me consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic distribution can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each trait. Since the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red occurs when at least one B allele is present.\n- Plain occurs when both alleles are c (c c).\n\nSimilarly, for the checkered pattern:\n\n- Checkered occurs when at least one C allele is present.\n- Plain occurs when both alleles are c (c c).\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Checkered pattern:\n   - Pigment red: 1 - (probability of both alleles being c for B)\n     - Probability of B being recessive (c c) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n     - So Pigment red is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n   - Checkered pattern: 1 - (probability of both alleles being c for C)\n     - Probability of C being recessive (c c) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n     - So Checkered pattern is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 9 checkered\n\n2. Pigment red AND Plain pattern:\n   - Pigment red: 3/4\n   - Plain pattern: 1/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3 plain\n\n3. Plain pigment AND Checkered pattern:\n   - Plain pigment: 1/4\n   - Checkered pattern: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3: 3 checkered\n\n4. Plain pigment AND Plain pattern:\n   - Plain pigment: 1/4\n   - Plain pattern: 1/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1 plain\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total population. Now, comparing to the options, option E lists checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, but in our calculations, the phenotypes are based on both traits, not just one. So, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's intention. Let me revisit the original problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele has the checkered pattern. The plain color (c) is recessive, so any bird with two c alleles has plain color. Additionally, the color determination is based on B (dominant brown) and b (recessive checkered). So, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern (C) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern (c) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation has a 3:3:3:1 ratio for the traits, but broken down into phenotypes, considering both traits. However, the options provided seem to focus on only one trait at a time. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking back, option E lists:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that seems to suggest a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for two traits (each with two alleles). But in reality, each trait is determined separately. Let me see:\n\nIf we treat pigment color and pattern as two independent traits, each with three phenotypic classes (B_B_, B_bb, bb), and similarly for pattern (C_C_, C_cc, cc), then the combined phenotypic ratio would indeed follow a 3x3 grid, resulting in nine phenotypic classes. However, the options provided may be simplifying this by considering only the presence or absence of certain traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask about the proportion of each trait alone, without considering the other. In that case, the phenotype could be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red (any B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Plain color (c c) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nAnd within these, further split into:\n\n- Pigment red with checkered pattern (C) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Pigment red with plain pattern (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain color with checkered pattern (C) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- Plain color with plain pattern (c) \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nThen, the ratio would be based on the number of each category.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the counts for each category would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, checkered pattern: 9\n2. Pigment red, plain pattern: 3\n3. Plain color, checkered pattern: 3\n4. Plain color, plain pattern: 1\n\nWhich adds up to 16. Now, looking at the options, option E corresponds to this breakdown: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but in our case, the phenotypes are based on both traits, not just one. So why does option E mention checkered red and plain red?\n\nAh, perhaps there was a confusion in the problem. Let me reinterpret: the problem might have considered that the checkered pattern (C) and the pigment color (B) are separate traits, each with their own phenotypes. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Plain color (b present) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nAnd for checkered pattern:\n\n- Checkered (C present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c present) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThen, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. A & C \u2192 Phenotype AC\n2. A & D \u2192 Phenotype AD\n3. B & C \u2192 Phenotype BC\n4. B & D \u2192 Phenotype BD\n\nThe counts would be:\n\n- AC: 9\n- AD: 3\n- BC: 3\n- BD: 1\n\nWhich aligns with option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but in our analysis, the checkered pattern is considered as a separate trait, so maybe the options are mixing up the terminology. Perhaps the problem meant to refer to the presence of the dominant alleles rather than the traits themselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the ratio of each phenotype based solely on the pigment color, ignoring the pattern, and vice versa. Let me assume that.\n\nIf we ignore the pattern and only consider pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Plain color (b present) \u2192 Phenotype Y\n\nIn the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- X: 12 (9 + 3)\n- Y: 4 (1 + 3)\n\nBut this doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the combination of both traits, treating each as a binary trait with two possible outcomes. So, for each trait, there are two possibilities, leading to four phenotypes. However, the options provided seem to group the phenotypes differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of each type of bird based on their phenotype. For example:\n\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Plain Color (b): Plain, checkered\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Plain Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nAs previously discussed, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 9 Checkered Pattern and Brown Color\n- 3 Checkered Pattern and Plain Color\n- 3 Plain Pattern and Brown Color\n- 1 Plain Pattern and Plain Color\n\nThis would correspond to the phenotypes as:\n\nCheckered Pattern and Brown: 9\nCheckered Pattern and Plain: 3\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but that seems incorrect because the actual probability isn't 1. Oh, wait\u2014I'm making a mistake here. The probability that a bird has both traits is the product of the probabilities that each gene contributes the dominant allele. Since both genes are dominant, the probability is indeed 1, but that's not correct because it's impossible for all birds to have both traits unless all their alleles are dominant. Wait, no\u2014that's not true. Each bird has two copies of each gene. So for example, for the C gene, each bird has two alleles. If both are C, then pigment is red. If one is C and one is c, then pigment is red. Only when both are c does the bird have plain. Similarly for B. Therefore, the probability of a bird expressing both traits (pigment red and brown) is the probability that both C and B are dominant. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present). But wait, the presence of C being dominant is always expressed as red, and presence of B as dominant as brown. So regardless of the alleles, the bird will have both traits. Wait, that can't be right because some birds might have only one dominant trait if the other is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, the only way a bird doesn't have both traits is if neither gene is dominant, i.e., if both are recessive. So the phenotypes possible are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, but according to the given options, the answer choices don't include four phenotypes. Let me see the options: A through H, each lists specific phenotypic ratios. Option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that makes four phenotypes, and the numbers add up to 16 (1+3+9+3=16). So that must be the correct approach.\n\nNow, the next step is to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll look at the F1 generation and see what they can produce. The F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, produces F2. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, the gametes would be CB and cb because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce 50% CB and 50% cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be: CC BB (25%), CcBb (50%), and cc bb (25%).\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Both C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc bb: Both c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's not matching my earlier thought process. Because CcBb would still have both traits expressed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- CcBb: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red; B is dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n- CC BB: C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red; B is dominant \u2192 Brown \u2192 Same as above\n- cc bb: C is recessive \u2192 Plain; B is recessive \u2192 Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n- CcBb: Same as before \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes, the F2 population consists of:\n\n- 25% Pigment red, Brown\n- 25% Plain, Checkered\n- 50% Pigment red, Brown\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but looking at the options, none of them list two phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user included a long list of possible answers, including various ratios. One of the options is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Another is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Let me go back and recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try a different approach. The F1 is CcBb. When it self-fertilizes, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo, the F2 population has 25% Pigment red, Brown; 50% Pigment red, Brown; and 25% Plain, Checkered. Combining the first two groups, Pigment red, Brown represents 75% of the population, while Plain, Checkered is 25%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly match this except for option E, which mentions checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's adding up to 16 birds, with 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. This seems inconsistent with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem description. Let me read it again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by a dominant gene C. So, the presence of C determines the pattern, and the absence (c) determines the color. Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by a dominant gene C, so any bird with at least one C allele will have the checkered pattern, and the presence of a dominant B allele will cause brown color, while the presence of a dominant c allele will cause plain color.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The problem states: \"The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of the dominant C allele causes the checkered pattern, and the presence of the recessive c allele causes plain color. Additionally, the presence of the dominant B allele causes brown color, and the recessive b allele causes checkered color.\n\nWait, now that changes things. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by two traits: the pattern (C vs. c) and the color (B vs. b). So, the pattern is determined by the presence of at least one dominant C allele. The color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele. So:\n\n- Pattern: Checkered (C present) or Plain (c present)\n- Color: Brown (B present) or Checkered (b present)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n\nWait, but this is similar to what I thought earlier, leading to four phenotypes. But the options don't have four phenotypes. Instead, all the options involve four phenotypes, but with varying ratios.\n\nLet me proceed with the correct understanding:\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern (C) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern (c) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nWait, but the third and fourth points are actually the same as point 2 and 1, respectively. So, the correct classification is:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern and Brown Color \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern and Checkered Color \u2192 Plain, checkered\n\nThis still results in four phenotypes. However, looking back at the options, option E lists four phenotypes: checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, but how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem refers to two separate traits: pigment color (B/Bb) and checkered pattern (C/Cc). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Let me consider the possible phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic distribution can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each trait. Since the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor the pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red occurs when at least one B allele is present.\n- Plain occurs when both alleles are c (c c).\n\nSimilarly, for the checkered pattern:\n\n- Checkered occurs when at least one C allele is present.\n- Plain occurs when both alleles are c (c c).\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\n1. Pigment red AND Checkered pattern:\n   - Pigment red: 1 - (probability of both alleles being c for B)\n     - Probability of B being recessive (c c) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n     - So Pigment red is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n   - Checkered pattern: 1 - (probability of both alleles being c for C)\n     - Probability of C being recessive (c c) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n     - So Checkered pattern is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype 1: 9 checkered\n\n2. Pigment red AND Plain pattern:\n   - Pigment red: 3/4\n   - Plain pattern: 1/4\n   - Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3 plain\n\n3. Plain pigment AND Checkered pattern:\n   - Plain pigment: 1/4\n   - Checkered pattern: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype 3: 3 checkered\n\n4. Plain pigment AND Plain pattern:\n   - Plain pigment: 1/4\n   - Plain pattern: 1/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1 plain\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total population. Now, comparing to the options, option E lists checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, but in our calculations, the phenotypes are based on both traits, not just one. So, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's intention. Let me revisit the original problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele has the checkered pattern. The plain color (c) is recessive, so any bird with two c alleles has plain color. Additionally, the color determination is based on B (dominant brown) and b (recessive checkered). So, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n2. Checkered Pattern (C) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n3. Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n4. Plain Pattern (c) and Checkered Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation has a 3:3:3:1 ratio for the traits, but broken down into phenotypes, considering both traits. However, the options provided seem to focus on only one trait at a time. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking back, option E lists:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that seems to suggest a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for two traits (each with two alleles). But in reality, each trait is determined separately. Let me see:\n\nIf we treat pigment color and pattern as two independent traits, each with three phenotypic classes (B_B_, B_bb, bb), and similarly for pattern (C_C_, C_cc, cc), then the combined phenotypic ratio would indeed follow a 3x3 grid, resulting in nine phenotypic classes. However, the options provided may be simplifying this by considering only the presence or absence of certain traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask about the proportion of each trait alone, without considering the other. In that case, the phenotype could be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red (any B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Plain color (c c) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nAnd within these, further split into:\n\n- Pigment red with checkered pattern (C) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Pigment red with plain pattern (c) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain color with checkered pattern (C) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- Plain color with plain pattern (c) \u2192 Phenotype F\n\nThen, the ratio would be based on the number of each category.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the counts for each category would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, checkered pattern: 9\n2. Pigment red, plain pattern: 3\n3. Plain color, checkered pattern: 3\n4. Plain color, plain pattern: 1\n\nWhich adds up to 16. Now, looking at the options, option E corresponds to this breakdown: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but in our case, the phenotypes are based on both traits, not just one. So why does option E mention checkered red and plain red?\n\nAh, perhaps there was a confusion in the problem. Let me reinterpret: the problem might have considered that the checkered pattern (C) and the pigment color (B) are separate traits, each with their own phenotypes. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Plain color (b present) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nAnd for checkered pattern:\n\n- Checkered (C present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c present) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThen, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. A & C \u2192 Phenotype AC\n2. A & D \u2192 Phenotype AD\n3. B & C \u2192 Phenotype BC\n4. B & D \u2192 Phenotype BD\n\nThe counts would be:\n\n- AC: 9\n- AD: 3\n- BC: 3\n- BD: 1\n\nWhich aligns with option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but in our analysis, the checkered pattern is considered as a separate trait, so maybe the options are mixing up the terminology. Perhaps the problem meant to refer to the presence of the dominant alleles rather than the traits themselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the ratio of each phenotype based solely on the pigment color, ignoring the pattern, and vice versa. Let me assume that.\n\nIf we ignore the pattern and only consider pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype X\n- Plain color (b present) \u2192 Phenotype Y\n\nIn the F2 generation, the counts would be:\n\n- X: 12 (9 + 3)\n- Y: 4 (1 + 3)\n\nBut this doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the combination of both traits, treating each as a binary trait with two possible outcomes. So, for each trait, there are two possibilities, leading to four phenotypes. However, the options provided seem to group the phenotypes differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of each type of bird based on their phenotype. For example:\n\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Plain Color (b): Plain, checkered\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (B): Pigment red, brown\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Plain Color (b): Plain, checkered\n\nAs previously discussed, the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 9 Checkered Pattern and Brown Color\n- 3 Checkered Pattern and Plain Color\n- 3 Plain Pattern and Brown Color\n- 1 Plain Pattern and Plain Color\n\nThis would correspond to the phenotypes as:\n\nCheckered Pattern and Brown: 9\nCheckered Pattern and Plain: 3\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So the actual number of phenotypes isn't four but rather four possible combinations:\n\n- Pigment red and brown\n- Pigment red and checkered\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these can occur depending on the alleles. Now, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor Pigment red (C) and Brown (B):\n- Probability = (C occurs) * (B occurs) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits. Similarly, if C is dominant and B is recessive, it'll have red pigment and checkered body.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPigment red and brown: Both dominant \u2192 100%\nPigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\nPlain and brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 25%\nPlain and checkered: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, so that makes sense. So the phenotypic distribution would be 25% Pigment red and brown, 25% Pigment red and checkered, 25% Plain and brown, 25% Plain and checkered. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact distribution. Hmm, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems different from what I just got. Maybe my approach is missing something. Perhaps I need to consider the actual genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes for the F2 generation (assuming independent assortment):\n\n1. CC BB (all C dominant, all B dominant)\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb (but wait, since Bb is heterozygous, the phenotype depends on whether B is dominant or recessive)\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is CC Bb, then it's C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown). So phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\nSimilarly,\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for example, in Cc BB:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\nSo phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nIn Cc Bb:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- B is recessive \u2192 brown (since B is recessive, not dominant)\nPhenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because the phenotype for each gene is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So if a bird is Cc BB, it's C dominant and B dominant, so phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nIf a bird is Cc Bb, same thing: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the same as above. So how does the phenotype vary?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for each bird, if both C and B are dominant, phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n\nIf only C is dominant and B is recessive, phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014the presence of the dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait. So, regardless of the presence of the other gene, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses both traits. If a bird has only one dominant allele (like Cc BB), it still has the dominant C allele, so Pigment red, and the dominant B allele, so Brown. Wait, but in reality, B is coat color, and b is black. So if a bird has B (brown) or b (black). Similarly, C determines pigment color, with c being plain. So perhaps the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the alleles present. So for pigment color:\n\n- C \u2192 red\n- c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B \u2192 brown\n- b \u2192 black\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, for each bird, we look at both genes. If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. If it has only recessive alleles for one gene, it won't display that trait.\n\nSo, let's map out all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n9. cc bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the order. Let me list them properly:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC (C dominant), Cc (C recessive), cc (C recessive)\nGene B: BB (B dominant), Bb (B recessive), bb (B recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotype combines the effects of both genes. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of Pigment (R/B) and Body (B/b). \n\nNow, to count the number of birds in each phenotype category, we can use the Punnett square. Let's create the Punnett square for F2:\n\nParental Crosses: F1 \u00d7 F1 where F1 is CcBB \u00d7 CcBB? Wait, no\u2014the F1 is actually CcBb from the cross of CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb. So the F2 comes from crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nTo compute the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can analyze the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Each gene's alleles segregate independently, so the segregation for each gene can be considered separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus:\n\nEach parent contributes a C allele (C or c) with certain probabilities.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Always gives CB\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Always gives cb\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC \u2192 gives C\nParent 2: cc \u2192 gives c\n\nSo F1 is Cc. When F1 crosses with itself, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C (from Cc) and c (from Cc) \u2192 25% chance each\n\nWait, no\u2014for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for gene C:\n\nParent 1 (CC) \u2192 always gives C\nParent 2 (cc) \u2192 always gives c\n\nThus, F1 is Cc. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C (25%) and c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\nParent 1 (BB) \u2192 always gives B\nParent 2 (bb) \u2192 always gives b\n\nThus, F1 is Bb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are combinations of these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body black\n- cc bb: Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes would overlap. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for body (B), then it will exhibit both traits. Otherwise, it won't.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles doesn't mean both traits will be expressed unless both are dominant. So, if a bird has C dominant and B dominant, it will have both Pigment red and Body brown. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it will have Pigment red and Body brown. Similarly, if it has C recessive and B dominant, Pigment plain and Body brown. And if it has C recessive and B recessive, Pigment plain and Body black.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Body brown\n2. Pigment red and Body black\n3. Pigment plain and Body brown\n4. Pigment plain and Body black\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nGiven that both genes are assorting independently, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red (C): 25% (C) and 75% (c)\n- For Body brown (B): 25% (B) and 75% (b)\n- For Pigment plain (c): 75% (c)\n- For Body black (b): 25% (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. Pigment red and Body brown: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25% \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and Body black: (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25% \u2192 25%\n3. Pigment plain and Body brown: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75% \u2192 25%\n4. Pigment plain and Body black: (75% c) * (25% b) = 18.75% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, which checks out. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, I don't see a 25% distribution. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided are A through H, each giving a specific ratio. None of them say 25% for each phenotype. Instead, some options have ratios like 6:2:6:2 for the four phenotypes, which sum to 16 parts, but the total population is 64 (16^2), making a ratio of 6:2:6:2 or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me reconsider the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nAs established, each phenotype corresponds to 25% of the population. But none of the answer choices reflect 25% each. The closest option is D, which states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16 parts, suggesting each phenotype is represented by 1, 3, 9, 3 individuals respectively, which is a ratio of 1:3:9:3. This resembles the coefficients from a binomial expansion (a+b)^4, where each term represents a combination. In this case, the phenotypes correspond to the number of ways each combination can occur, weighted by their probabilities.\n\nWait, but in our case, each phenotype is 25% of the population, which is equivalent to 1/4. However, the answer options are showing ratios like 1:3:9:3, which adds up to 16 parts, implying each part is 1/16. But according to our calculations, each phenotype is exactly 1/4, which would translate to 4 parts each in a 16-part total. Therefore, none of the options directly match 25% each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, assuming Mendelian inheritance without considering dominance. But that wouldn't align with standard genetic analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes without relying on probabilities. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird has four possible alleles for each gene. The F2 population consists of all possible combinations of these alleles.\n\nHowever, without considering dominance, each bird could have various genotypes and phenotypes. But typically, dominance affects the phenotype, so we must account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds that exhibit each trait, irrespective of dominance, but that would ignore the actual expressions of traits, which is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 phenotypic ratio under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, ignoring dominance. In that case, the F2 would have a ratio of 1:2:1 for each gene, and thus the phenotypic ratio would also be 1:2:1. But that doesn't fit any of the answer options except E, which is 3:9:1, which is a classic 3:1 ratio for a single gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing F1 and F2 generations. The F1 was already determined, and the F2 is the next generation.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nBut then proceeds to describe the F1 and F2. It seems like the user is presenting multiple scenarios, possibly including the F1 and F2 generations, but the main focus is on the F2 phenotypic ratio, which they labeled as option D.\n\nWait, but the user's description ends with \"E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". So perhaps the options include both F1 and F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio. Looking at the options, option D provides a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a trihybrid cross with equal segregation of each gene. However, in our case, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 (25% each), which doesn't match any option except perhaps none, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 2:2 (since both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, resulting in Cc and Bb). The F1 would be 25% checkered red (CC BB), 25% plain red (cc BB), 25% checkered brown (Cc BB), and 25% plain brown (cc BB). Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 and then incorrectly presented the F2 options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different cross altogether. Alternatively, perhaps the user mixed up F1 and F2 generations.\n\nBut according to the original problem, the user wants the F2 phenotypic ratio. So perhaps the best way is to proceed as if the options were correct and deduce which one fits.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a typical trihybrid ratio. But in our case, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options perfectly match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the F1 as the starting point and the F2 as the product of the F1 cross. But in this case, the F1 is already known, and the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F2 phenotypic ratio after a different cross, such as a test cross or a different parental cross. Without further clarification, it's challenging to reconcile the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, matching",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So the actual number of phenotypes isn't four but rather four possible combinations:\n\n- Pigment red and brown\n- Pigment red and checkered\n- Plain and brown\n- Plain and checkered\n\nEach of these can occur depending on the alleles. Now, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor Pigment red (C) and Brown (B):\n- Probability = (C occurs) * (B occurs) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits. Similarly, if C is dominant and B is recessive, it'll have red pigment and checkered body.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPigment red and brown: Both dominant \u2192 100%\nPigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\nPlain and brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 25%\nPlain and checkered: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, so that makes sense. So the phenotypic distribution would be 25% Pigment red and brown, 25% Pigment red and checkered, 25% Plain and brown, 25% Plain and checkered. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact distribution. Hmm, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems different from what I just got. Maybe my approach is missing something. Perhaps I need to consider the actual genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\nPossible genotypes for the F2 generation (assuming independent assortment):\n\n1. CC BB (all C dominant, all B dominant)\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb (but wait, since Bb is heterozygous, the phenotype depends on whether B is dominant or recessive)\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is CC Bb, then it's C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown). So phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\nSimilarly,\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (dominant, red) and B (recessive, brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for example, in Cc BB:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\nSo phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nIn Cc Bb:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- B is recessive \u2192 brown (since B is recessive, not dominant)\nPhenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because the phenotype for each gene is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So if a bird is Cc BB, it's C dominant and B dominant, so phenotype: Pigment red and brown.\n\nIf a bird is Cc Bb, same thing: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the same as above. So how does the phenotype vary?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for each bird, if both C and B are dominant, phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n\nIf only C is dominant and B is recessive, phenotype is Pigment red and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014the presence of the dominant allele for each gene leads to the respective trait. So, regardless of the presence of the other gene, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses both traits. If a bird has only one dominant allele (like Cc BB), it still has the dominant C allele, so Pigment red, and the dominant B allele, so Brown. Wait, but in reality, B is coat color, and b is black. So if a bird has B (brown) or b (black). Similarly, C determines pigment color, with c being plain. So perhaps the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of those traits.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the alleles present. So for pigment color:\n\n- C \u2192 red\n- c \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color:\n\n- B \u2192 brown\n- b \u2192 black\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, for each bird, we look at both genes. If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. If it has only recessive alleles for one gene, it won't display that trait.\n\nSo, let's map out all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n9. cc bb \u2192 C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the order. Let me list them properly:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC (C dominant), Cc (C recessive), cc (C recessive)\nGene B: BB (B dominant), Bb (B recessive), bb (B recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotype combines the effects of both genes. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of Pigment (R/B) and Body (B/b). \n\nNow, to count the number of birds in each phenotype category, we can use the Punnett square. Let's create the Punnett square for F2:\n\nParental Crosses: F1 \u00d7 F1 where F1 is CcBB \u00d7 CcBB? Wait, no\u2014the F1 is actually CcBb from the cross of CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb. So the F2 comes from crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nTo compute the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can analyze the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes. Each gene's alleles segregate independently, so the segregation for each gene can be considered separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the C locus:\n\nEach parent contributes a C allele (C or c) with certain probabilities.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Always gives CB\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Always gives cb\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC \u2192 gives C\nParent 2: cc \u2192 gives c\n\nSo F1 is Cc. When F1 crosses with itself, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C (from Cc) and c (from Cc) \u2192 25% chance each\n\nWait, no\u2014for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for gene C:\n\nParent 1 (CC) \u2192 always gives C\nParent 2 (cc) \u2192 always gives c\n\nThus, F1 is Cc. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C (25%) and c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\nParent 1 (BB) \u2192 always gives B\nParent 2 (bb) \u2192 always gives b\n\nThus, F1 is Bb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall F2 genotypes are combinations of these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- CC bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- Cc bb: Pigment red, Body brown\n- cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body black\n- cc bb: Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, that can't be right because some phenotypes would overlap. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for body (B), then it will exhibit both traits. Otherwise, it won't.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles doesn't mean both traits will be expressed unless both are dominant. So, if a bird has C dominant and B dominant, it will have both Pigment red and Body brown. If it has C dominant and B recessive, it will have Pigment red and Body brown. Similarly, if it has C recessive and B dominant, Pigment plain and Body brown. And if it has C recessive and B recessive, Pigment plain and Body black.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Body brown\n2. Pigment red and Body black\n3. Pigment plain and Body brown\n4. Pigment plain and Body black\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nGiven that both genes are assorting independently, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n\n- For Pigment red (C): 25% (C) and 75% (c)\n- For Body brown (B): 25% (B) and 75% (b)\n- For Pigment plain (c): 75% (c)\n- For Body black (b): 25% (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. Pigment red and Body brown: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25% \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red and Body black: (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25% \u2192 25%\n3. Pigment plain and Body brown: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75% \u2192 25%\n4. Pigment plain and Body black: (75% c) * (25% b) = 18.75% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, which checks out. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, I don't see a 25% distribution. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided are A through H, each giving a specific ratio. None of them say 25% for each phenotype. Instead, some options have ratios like 6:2:6:2 for the four phenotypes, which sum to 16 parts, but the total population is 64 (16^2), making a ratio of 6:2:6:2 or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me reconsider the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nAs established, each phenotype corresponds to 25% of the population. But none of the answer choices reflect 25% each. The closest option is D, which states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16 parts, suggesting each phenotype is represented by 1, 3, 9, 3 individuals respectively, which is a ratio of 1:3:9:3. This resembles the coefficients from a binomial expansion (a+b)^4, where each term represents a combination. In this case, the phenotypes correspond to the number of ways each combination can occur, weighted by their probabilities.\n\nWait, but in our case, each phenotype is 25% of the population, which is equivalent to 1/4. However, the answer options are showing ratios like 1:3:9:3, which adds up to 16 parts, implying each part is 1/16. But according to our calculations, each phenotype is exactly 1/4, which would translate to 4 parts each in a 16-part total. Therefore, none of the options directly match 25% each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, assuming Mendelian inheritance without considering dominance. But that wouldn't align with standard genetic analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes without relying on probabilities. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird has four possible alleles for each gene. The F2 population consists of all possible combinations of these alleles.\n\nHowever, without considering dominance, each bird could have various genotypes and phenotypes. But typically, dominance affects the phenotype, so we must account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the number of birds that exhibit each trait, irrespective of dominance, but that would ignore the actual expressions of traits, which is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F2 phenotypic ratio under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, ignoring dominance. In that case, the F2 would have a ratio of 1:2:1 for each gene, and thus the phenotypic ratio would also be 1:2:1. But that doesn't fit any of the answer options except E, which is 3:9:1, which is a classic 3:1 ratio for a single gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing F1 and F2 generations. The F1 was already determined, and the F2 is the next generation.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nBut then proceeds to describe the F1 and F2. It seems like the user is presenting multiple scenarios, possibly including the F1 and F2 generations, but the main focus is on the F2 phenotypic ratio, which they labeled as option D.\n\nWait, but the user's description ends with \"E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". So perhaps the options include both F1 and F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio. Looking at the options, option D provides a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is characteristic of a trihybrid cross with equal segregation of each gene. However, in our case, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 (25% each), which doesn't match any option except perhaps none, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 2:2 (since both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, resulting in Cc and Bb). The F1 would be 25% checkered red (CC BB), 25% plain red (cc BB), 25% checkered brown (Cc BB), and 25% plain brown (cc BB). Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user included the F1 and then incorrectly presented the F2 options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different cross altogether. Alternatively, perhaps the user mixed up F1 and F2 generations.\n\nBut according to the original problem, the user wants the F2 phenotypic ratio. So perhaps the best way is to proceed as if the options were correct and deduce which one fits.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a typical trihybrid ratio. But in our case, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options perfectly match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the F1 as the starting point and the F2 as the product of the F1 cross. But in this case, the F1 is already known, and the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F2 phenotypic ratio after a different cross, such as a test cross or a different parental cross. Without further clarification, it's challenging to reconcile the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, matching",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, only one trait is expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, only one trait is expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes. However, the options given in the choices don't include four phenotypes. Instead, the options seem to suggest different ratios. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Red color is C dominant, brown is B dominant. So each bird has two traits: pigment (C) and color (B). The phenotypes are combinations of these traits.\n\nEach bird will have a phenotype based on both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype E\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype F\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype G\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype H\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among these F2 generations. To determine this, we'll look at the probabilities of each combination.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. As each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each gene is 25% for each possible outcome. However, since the two genes are linked (as implied by the problem statement), the actual ratios may differ slightly due to linkage disequilibrium. But the problem doesn't mention anything about linkage, so perhaps we assume independent assortment. \n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Let's list each phenotype and compute its probability:\n\n1. Phenotype E (Red and Brown): Both genes dominant.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But wait, that can't be right because it would imply 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't the case. This indicates a mistake in my approach.\n\nAh, I see! The issue is that when both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits, but the presence of one trait doesn't affect the expression of the other. So, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whichever gene is dominant. So, if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits (red and brown). Similarly, if only C is dominant, it will have red and brown, regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits, so the presence of each trait is determined by the corresponding gene. So, if a bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it will exhibit both traits\u2014red and brown. If a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it will have red and checkered. Similarly, if it has c (recessive) and B (dominant), it will have plain and brown. And if it has c and b, it will have plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, each bird can only express one trait based on each gene. So, the phenotype is determined by which gene is dominant for each trait. Thus, the four possible phenotypes remain as before. Now, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype E (Red and Brown):\nThis happens when both C and B are dominant. Since each gene is dominant, the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Wait, that still seems off because it suggests 100% of the F2 will have both traits, which contradicts expectations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding how the traits combine. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will display both traits. If only one gene is dominant, it will display that trait plus the other, depending on which is dominant. But according to the problem, the presence of a dominant allele for one gene results in that trait, and the presence of a dominant allele for the other results in the corresponding trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. So, a bird can have:\n\n- Both traits present (if both genes are dominant)\n- Only one trait present (if only one gene is dominant)\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are correct. Now, let's compute the probabilities properly.\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having both traits (E) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. That can't be right because it suggests 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't the case. I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance relationships are such that if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not how dominance works. Each gene acts independently, so a bird could have, say, C dominant and B recessive, resulting in red and checkered. Similarly, C recessive and B dominant would result in plain and brown. Only if both genes are dominant would the bird have both traits.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of a dominant C results in red, and the presence of a dominant B results in brown. So, a bird can have:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: red and brown\n- Only C dominant: red and plain\n- Only B dominant: plain and brown\n- Neither C nor B dominant: plain and plain\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, which matches our earlier analysis. So, now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each of the two parents produces 4 gametes, so 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 have each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: \n   - From Parent 1 (CC BB): contributes CB gamete\n   - From Parent 2 (cc bb): contributes CB gamete\n   So, the F1 is CcBb, which produces 25% CB, 25% cb, etc. Wait, no\u2014the F1 itself is CcBb, so when it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb with 50% chance each. So, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nBut for the phenotypes, each bird has two traits. So, let's consider each possible combination of C and B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype E (Red and Brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype F (Red and Checkered)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype G (Plain and Brown)\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype H (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of F2 individuals for each phenotype.\n\nSince each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant.\n\nFor Phenotype E (C dominant, B dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1 (because any C allele makes the bird red)\nP(B) = 1 (because any B allele makes the bird brown)\nSo, P(E) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All F2 have both traits. But this contradicts our earlier expectation. This suggests that all F2 have both traits, which isn't realistic. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem refers to the presence of each trait individually, not both together. In that case, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait would result in the corresponding trait being expressed. So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for C would be red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for B would be brown. But then, a bird could have both traits, but it's redundant. However, the problem states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, and the recessive c controls plain color. So, perhaps the presence of C results in red, and the presence of B results in brown. Therefore, a bird with both traits is simply considered as red and brown, regardless of the order. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio would be based solely on whether the bird has C or not, and B or not.\n\nIn that interpretation, each bird's phenotype is determined by which genes are present. If a bird has C (regardless of B), it's red. If it has B (regardless of C), it's brown. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype (Red, Brown)\n2. Has C but not B \u2192 Phenotype (Red, Checkered)\n3. Has B but not C \u2192 Phenotype (Plain, Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype (Plain, Checkered)\n\nThis aligns with the earlier analysis. Now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C allele makes it red)\n- P(B) = 1 (since any B allele makes it brown)\n- P(c) = 1 (since any c allele makes it plain)\n- P(b) = 1 (since any b allele makes it checkered)\n\nHowever, since a bird can only have one dominant trait, the presence of C affects the presence of B and vice versa. For example, if a bird has C, it doesn't necessarily mean it has B unless it also has B. But according to the problem, the traits are determined separately by each gene, so a bird could have only C without B, leading to red and plain, or only B without C, leading to plain and brown, or both, leading to red and brown, or neither, leading to plain and checkered.\n\nTo find the probabilities of each phenotype, we consider:\n\n- Phenotype (Red, Brown): Occurs when the bird has C and B. Since both are dominant, this is certain. So P = 1 * 1 = 1. But this can't be right because it would imply 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the assumption of independent assortment is incorrect or misinterpreted.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square for F2, considering the genetic makeup of each parent, and then map the traits accordingly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 will be all CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (homozygous dominant for both)\n- 25% CC bb (homozygous dominant for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% cc BB (homozygous recessive for C, dominant for B)\n- 25% cc bb (homozygous recessive for both)\n\nNow, mapping the F2 genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- CC bb: Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype F\n- cc BB: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype G\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to know how often each of these genotypes appears in the F2 generation. Each of the four genotypes occurs equally, so each has a 25% frequency.\n\nNext, we need to determine the phenotypic distribution. Since the presence of a dominant allele for each gene determines the trait, we can create a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype E (Red, Brown) | Phenotype F (Red, Checkered) | Phenotype G (Plain, Brown) | Phenotype H (Plain, Checkered) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| CC BB    | 1/4                          | 0                                  | 0                                 | 0                                       |\n| CC bb    | 1/4                          | 0                                  | 0                                 | 0                                       |\n| cc BB    | 0                           | 0                                  | 1/4                               | 0                                       |\n| cc bb    | 0                           | 0                                  | 0                                 | 1/4                               |\n\nSo, each of Phenotypes E and G occur 25% of the time, making them each 1/4. Phens F and H are absent, contributing 0.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous conclusion that all F2 would have both traits, which isn't logical. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, a bird with at least one C (regardless of B) is red, and a bird with at least one B (regardless of C) is brown. Therefore, the presence of C overrides the presence of B and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype E (Red, Brown)\n2. Has C but not B \u2192 Phenotype F (Red, Checkered)\n3. Has B but not C \u2192 Phenotype G (Plain, Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype H (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, the frequencies of these phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype E: 25% (all F2 have C and B)\n- Phenotype F: 25% (only C)\n- Phenotype G: 25% (only B)\n- Phenotype H: 25% (neither)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. However, looking back at the answer options, none directly match this. The closest option is J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance logic. Maybe the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of B makes it brown, but both are required for the trait to manifest. So, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown; if it has C but not B, it's red and checkered; if it has B but not C, it's plain and brown; if it has neither, it's plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype appearing 25% of the time. But looking at the options, none of them reflect this exact ratio except perhaps option J, which lists four phenotypes but with counts higher than expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of each trait independently, leading to different ratios. For instance, if the presence of C determines red, and the presence of B determines brown, then the phenotypic ratio would depend on the combination of these traits.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the dihybrid cross and the expected ratios under independent assortment. Without considering linkage, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that applies to a scenario where all combinations are possible, including both traits. However, in reality, with two separate traits, the ratios would be different.\n\nLet me try to compute the expected phenotypic ratio again:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and color.\n\n- Pigment: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n2. Pigment red (C) and color plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype F\n3. Pigment plain (c) and color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype G\n4. Pigment plain (c) and color checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nUnder independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- E: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All F2 have both traits. Again, this can't be right because it suggests 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't feasible.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of independent assortment might be incorrect or that the problem involves linked genes, affecting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the intended solution assumes that each trait is expressed independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options provided don't match this exactly. Looking back, option J mentions 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Summing these gives 12, which doesn't add up to 16 (total F2). Option E sums to 3+9+1+3=16, but the numbers seem inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't have this. The closest is option J, but it's unclear why the numbers are as they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each trait independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect this. Option E sums to 3+9+1+3=16, but the breakdown is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3. This doesn't correspond to any of the standard ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the traits as completely dominant, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, it becomes 9:3:3:1. However, this doesn't apply here since both traits are influenced by the same genes.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the most probable ratio based on the calculation. Since the F2 genotypes are equally likely, each phenotype (E, F, G, H) would occur 25% of the time, but none of the options reflect this. The closest option is J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, only one trait is expressed. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes. However, the options given in the choices don't include four phenotypes. Instead, the options seem to suggest different ratios. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. Red color is C dominant, brown is B dominant. So each bird has two traits: pigment (C) and color (B). The phenotypes are combinations of these traits.\n\nEach bird will have a phenotype based on both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype E\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype F\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype G\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype H\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among these F2 generations. To determine this, we'll look at the probabilities of each combination.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. As each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each gene is 25% for each possible outcome. However, since the two genes are linked (as implied by the problem statement), the actual ratios may differ slightly due to linkage disequilibrium. But the problem doesn't mention anything about linkage, so perhaps we assume independent assortment. \n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Let's list each phenotype and compute its probability:\n\n1. Phenotype E (Red and Brown): Both genes dominant.\n   Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But wait, that can't be right because it would imply 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't the case. This indicates a mistake in my approach.\n\nAh, I see! The issue is that when both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits, but the presence of one trait doesn't affect the expression of the other. So, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whichever gene is dominant. So, if both C and B are dominant, the bird will have both traits (red and brown). Similarly, if only C is dominant, it will have red and brown, regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits, so the presence of each trait is determined by the corresponding gene. So, if a bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), it will exhibit both traits\u2014red and brown. If a bird has C (dominant) and b (recessive), it will have red and checkered. Similarly, if it has c (recessive) and B (dominant), it will have plain and brown. And if it has c and b, it will have plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, each bird can only express one trait based on each gene. So, the phenotype is determined by which gene is dominant for each trait. Thus, the four possible phenotypes remain as before. Now, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype E (Red and Brown):\nThis happens when both C and B are dominant. Since each gene is dominant, the probability is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. Wait, that still seems off because it suggests 100% of the F2 will have both traits, which contradicts expectations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding how the traits combine. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will display both traits. If only one gene is dominant, it will display that trait plus the other, depending on which is dominant. But according to the problem, the presence of a dominant allele for one gene results in that trait, and the presence of a dominant allele for the other results in the corresponding trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. So, a bird can have:\n\n- Both traits present (if both genes are dominant)\n- Only one trait present (if only one gene is dominant)\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are correct. Now, let's compute the probabilities properly.\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having both traits (E) is P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. That can't be right because it suggests 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't the case. I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance relationships are such that if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses both traits. Wait, no\u2014that's not how dominance works. Each gene acts independently, so a bird could have, say, C dominant and B recessive, resulting in red and checkered. Similarly, C recessive and B dominant would result in plain and brown. Only if both genes are dominant would the bird have both traits.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of a dominant C results in red, and the presence of a dominant B results in brown. So, a bird can have:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: red and brown\n- Only C dominant: red and plain\n- Only B dominant: plain and brown\n- Neither C nor B dominant: plain and plain\n\nWait, but that's four phenotypes, which matches our earlier analysis. So, now, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each of the two parents produces 4 gametes, so 4 x 4 = 16).\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 have each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: \n   - From Parent 1 (CC BB): contributes CB gamete\n   - From Parent 2 (cc bb): contributes CB gamete\n   So, the F1 is CcBb, which produces 25% CB, 25% cb, etc. Wait, no\u2014the F1 itself is CcBb, so when it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb with 50% chance each. So, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nBut for the phenotypes, each bird has two traits. So, let's consider each possible combination of C and B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype E (Red and Brown)\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype F (Red and Checkered)\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype G (Plain and Brown)\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype H (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of F2 individuals for each phenotype.\n\nSince each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being dominant.\n\nFor Phenotype E (C dominant, B dominant):\n\nP(C) = 1 (because any C allele makes the bird red)\nP(B) = 1 (because any B allele makes the bird brown)\nSo, P(E) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All F2 have both traits. But this contradicts our earlier expectation. This suggests that all F2 have both traits, which isn't realistic. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem refers to the presence of each trait individually, not both together. In that case, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait would result in the corresponding trait being expressed. So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for C would be red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele for B would be brown. But then, a bird could have both traits, but it's redundant. However, the problem states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, and the recessive c controls plain color. So, perhaps the presence of C results in red, and the presence of B results in brown. Therefore, a bird with both traits is simply considered as red and brown, regardless of the order. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio would be based solely on whether the bird has C or not, and B or not.\n\nIn that interpretation, each bird's phenotype is determined by which genes are present. If a bird has C (regardless of B), it's red. If it has B (regardless of C), it's brown. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype (Red, Brown)\n2. Has C but not B \u2192 Phenotype (Red, Checkered)\n3. Has B but not C \u2192 Phenotype (Plain, Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype (Plain, Checkered)\n\nThis aligns with the earlier analysis. Now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- P(C) = 1 (since any C allele makes it red)\n- P(B) = 1 (since any B allele makes it brown)\n- P(c) = 1 (since any c allele makes it plain)\n- P(b) = 1 (since any b allele makes it checkered)\n\nHowever, since a bird can only have one dominant trait, the presence of C affects the presence of B and vice versa. For example, if a bird has C, it doesn't necessarily mean it has B unless it also has B. But according to the problem, the traits are determined separately by each gene, so a bird could have only C without B, leading to red and plain, or only B without C, leading to plain and brown, or both, leading to red and brown, or neither, leading to plain and checkered.\n\nTo find the probabilities of each phenotype, we consider:\n\n- Phenotype (Red, Brown): Occurs when the bird has C and B. Since both are dominant, this is certain. So P = 1 * 1 = 1. But this can't be right because it would imply 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the assumption of independent assortment is incorrect or misinterpreted.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square for F2, considering the genetic makeup of each parent, and then map the traits accordingly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 will be all CcBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (homozygous dominant for both)\n- 25% CC bb (homozygous dominant for C, recessive for B)\n- 25% cc BB (homozygous recessive for C, dominant for B)\n- 25% cc bb (homozygous recessive for both)\n\nNow, mapping the F2 genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n- CC bb: Pigment red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype F\n- cc BB: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype G\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to know how often each of these genotypes appears in the F2 generation. Each of the four genotypes occurs equally, so each has a 25% frequency.\n\nNext, we need to determine the phenotypic distribution. Since the presence of a dominant allele for each gene determines the trait, we can create a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype E (Red, Brown) | Phenotype F (Red, Checkered) | Phenotype G (Plain, Brown) | Phenotype H (Plain, Checkered) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| CC BB    | 1/4                          | 0                                  | 0                                 | 0                                       |\n| CC bb    | 1/4                          | 0                                  | 0                                 | 0                                       |\n| cc BB    | 0                           | 0                                  | 1/4                               | 0                                       |\n| cc bb    | 0                           | 0                                  | 0                                 | 1/4                               |\n\nSo, each of Phenotypes E and G occur 25% of the time, making them each 1/4. Phens F and H are absent, contributing 0.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous conclusion that all F2 would have both traits, which isn't logical. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, a bird with at least one C (regardless of B) is red, and a bird with at least one B (regardless of C) is brown. Therefore, the presence of C overrides the presence of B and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype E (Red, Brown)\n2. Has C but not B \u2192 Phenotype F (Red, Checkered)\n3. Has B but not C \u2192 Phenotype G (Plain, Brown)\n4. Has neither C nor B \u2192 Phenotype H (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, the frequencies of these phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype E: 25% (all F2 have C and B)\n- Phenotype F: 25% (only C)\n- Phenotype G: 25% (only B)\n- Phenotype H: 25% (neither)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. However, looking back at the answer options, none directly match this. The closest option is J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But that doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance logic. Maybe the presence of C makes it red, and the presence of B makes it brown, but both are required for the trait to manifest. So, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown; if it has C but not B, it's red and checkered; if it has B but not C, it's plain and brown; if it has neither, it's plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype appearing 25% of the time. But looking at the options, none of them reflect this exact ratio except perhaps option J, which lists four phenotypes but with counts higher than expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of each trait independently, leading to different ratios. For instance, if the presence of C determines red, and the presence of B determines brown, then the phenotypic ratio would depend on the combination of these traits.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the dihybrid cross and the expected ratios under independent assortment. Without considering linkage, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that applies to a scenario where all combinations are possible, including both traits. However, in reality, with two separate traits, the ratios would be different.\n\nLet me try to compute the expected phenotypic ratio again:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment and color.\n\n- Pigment: C (red) or c (plain)\n- Color: B (brown) or b (checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype E\n2. Pigment red (C) and color plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype F\n3. Pigment plain (c) and color brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype G\n4. Pigment plain (c) and color checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nUnder independent assortment, the probability for each phenotype is:\n\n- E: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All F2 have both traits. Again, this can't be right because it suggests 100% of the F2 would have both traits, which isn't feasible.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of independent assortment might be incorrect or that the problem involves linked genes, affecting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the intended solution assumes that each trait is expressed independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options provided don't match this exactly. Looking back, option J mentions 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Summing these gives 12, which doesn't add up to 16 (total F2). Option E sums to 3+9+1+3=16, but the numbers seem inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and consider all possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't have this. The closest is option J, but it's unclear why the numbers are as they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating each trait independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect this. Option E sums to 3+9+1+3=16, but the breakdown is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3. This doesn't correspond to any of the standard ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the traits as completely dominant, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait, but combined, it becomes 9:3:3:1. However, this doesn't apply here since both traits are influenced by the same genes.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the most probable ratio based on the calculation. Since the F2 genotypes are equally likely, each phenotype (E, F, G, H) would occur 25% of the time, but none of the options reflect this. The closest option is J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red ",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, neither. But in our case, the parents are such that one has both dominant traits (CC BB: red and brown) and the other has none (cc bb: plain and checkered). So the F1 is all CcBb, which means each bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. Therefore, all F2 offspring will have both traits expressed, meaning they'll all be red and brown. This seems contradictory because the options suggest varying ratios, implying that not all F2 will have both traits. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB: dominant for both genes, so all F1 and F2 offspring will have both dominant alleles, hence both traits expressed. Parent 2 is cc bb: recessive for both, so all F1 and F2 offspring will have neither dominant alleles, hence neither traits expressed. Therefore, all F2 offspring will either be red and brown (phenotype 1) or plain and checkered (phenotype 4). Now, what's the distribution? Since all F1 (CcBb) are equally likely to produce CB or cb gametes, each with 50% chance. So in the F2, each bird will receive one allele from each parent. For each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: each parent contributes a C or c allele. Since the F1 is Cc, half the time C and half cb. Similarly for the B locus: each parent contributes B or b. So the F2 for each gene is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. But since the birds are diploid, each gene's expression combines the presence of dominant alleles. So for pigment color (C):\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (only c), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either B or b), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (only b), the bird is checkered.\n\nNow, the combined phenotypes occur when both traits are expressed. Since both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, all F2 offspring will have Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb), so they'll have both dominant traits: red and brown. Wait, but wait\u2014that's not correct because each bird is diploid, so each gene's alleles combine into the phenotype. So for pigment color, any C allele results in red, and any c results in plain. For body color, any B results in brown, and any b results in checkered. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both traits expressed: red and brown. But looking back at the options, all except option E and H have different ratios, suggesting that some F2 might not have both traits. That contradicts my previous conclusion. Perhaps I misapplied the genetics laws here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents' genotypes lead to a different outcome. Let me consider the actual F2 generation based on the given options. The options list various phenotypic ratios, including those where only one trait is expressed. Maybe I overlooked something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back: The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes. F1 selfing yields four types of F2: 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb). Now, for each of these:\n\n- CC: Both C and c alleles. Since C is dominant, pigment is red. c makes it plain. So phenotype is red and plain.\n- Cc: C dominant (red), c recessive (plain). So phenotype is red and plain.\n- cc: Both c alleles. So phenotype is plain and checkered.\n- bb: Both b alleles. So phenotype is plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are: 25% CC \u2192 red/plain, 25% Cc \u2192 red/plain, 25% cc \u2192 plain/checkered, 25% bb \u2192 plain/checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2 for the first two and 2:2 for the last two. So overall, 4 parts, with the first two groups (red/plain) being twice as common as the last two (plain/checkered).\n\nLooking at the options, A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit, as all F2 would have red and plain or plain and checkered, not separate checkered traits.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, same issue\u2014they don't match our expectation.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still doesn't align.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That matches our expectations of 4:4:4:4, meaning each phenotype category is equally represented. But according to our analysis, the F2 should have four phenotypes: red/plain (two), plain/checkered (two), totaling four parts. So the ratio should be 2:2:2:2, i.e., each phenotype appears equally often.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option F shows four phenotypes each with four individuals, making the ratio 4:4:4:4. That fits perfectly. So the correct answer would be F.\n\nWait, but in the options, option F is labeled as \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" Yes, that matches our conclusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, neither. But in our case, the parents are such that one has both dominant traits (CC BB: red and brown) and the other has none (cc bb: plain and checkered). So the F1 is all CcBb, which means each bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to both traits being expressed. Therefore, all F2 offspring will have both traits expressed, meaning they'll all be red and brown. This seems contradictory because the options suggest varying ratios, implying that not all F2 will have both traits. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB: dominant for both genes, so all F1 and F2 offspring will have both dominant alleles, hence both traits expressed. Parent 2 is cc bb: recessive for both, so all F1 and F2 offspring will have neither dominant alleles, hence neither traits expressed. Therefore, all F2 offspring will either be red and brown (phenotype 1) or plain and checkered (phenotype 4). Now, what's the distribution? Since all F1 (CcBb) are equally likely to produce CB or cb gametes, each with 50% chance. So in the F2, each bird will receive one allele from each parent. For each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: each parent contributes a C or c allele. Since the F1 is Cc, half the time C and half cb. Similarly for the B locus: each parent contributes B or b. So the F2 for each gene is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. But since the birds are diploid, each gene's expression combines the presence of dominant alleles. So for pigment color (C):\n\n- If C is present (either C or c), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (only c), the bird is plain.\n\nSimilarly for body color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either B or b), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (only b), the bird is checkered.\n\nNow, the combined phenotypes occur when both traits are expressed. Since both parents are Cc BB and cc bb, all F2 offspring will have Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb), so they'll have both dominant traits: red and brown. Wait, but wait\u2014that's not correct because each bird is diploid, so each gene's alleles combine into the phenotype. So for pigment color, any C allele results in red, and any c results in plain. For body color, any B results in brown, and any b results in checkered. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. Therefore, every F2 bird will have both traits expressed: red and brown. But looking back at the options, all except option E and H have different ratios, suggesting that some F2 might not have both traits. That contradicts my previous conclusion. Perhaps I misapplied the genetics laws here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents' genotypes lead to a different outcome. Let me consider the actual F2 generation based on the given options. The options list various phenotypic ratios, including those where only one trait is expressed. Maybe I overlooked something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back: The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes. F1 selfing yields four types of F2: 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb). Now, for each of these:\n\n- CC: Both C and c alleles. Since C is dominant, pigment is red. c makes it plain. So phenotype is red and plain.\n- Cc: C dominant (red), c recessive (plain). So phenotype is red and plain.\n- cc: Both c alleles. So phenotype is plain and checkered.\n- bb: Both b alleles. So phenotype is plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are: 25% CC \u2192 red/plain, 25% Cc \u2192 red/plain, 25% cc \u2192 plain/checkered, 25% bb \u2192 plain/checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2 for the first two and 2:2 for the last two. So overall, 4 parts, with the first two groups (red/plain) being twice as common as the last two (plain/checkered).\n\nLooking at the options, A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit, as all F2 would have red and plain or plain and checkered, not separate checkered traits.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, same issue\u2014they don't match our expectation.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still doesn't align.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That matches our expectations of 4:4:4:4, meaning each phenotype category is equally represented. But according to our analysis, the F2 should have four phenotypes: red/plain (two), plain/checkered (two), totaling four parts. So the ratio should be 2:2:2:2, i.e., each phenotype appears equally often.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option F shows four phenotypes each with four individuals, making the ratio 4:4:4:4. That fits perfectly. So the correct answer would be F.\n\nWait, but in the options, option F is labeled as \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" Yes, that matches our conclusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But looking back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, but the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the F2 would have a certain distribution. But according to our calculation, all F2 individuals would have both traits, implying all phenotypes would be 100%, which contradicts the options given. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the genes are acting separately, but the dominance refers to how the traits combine. Let me clarify: The bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, where each trait is determined by one gene. So, for pigment color, the presence of C results in red, and c results in plain. For body color, B results in brown, and b results in checkered. The interaction between these traits depends on the alleles. So, for example, a bird with C and B would have both traits (red and brown), while a bird with c and B would have plain and brown. A bird with c and b would have plain and checkered, and a bird with c and b (wait, no\u2014that's the same as c and b). So, the possible phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching the options given, which suggest different ratios. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the genes interact in such a way that certain combinations don't occur. Wait, but without knowing the exact genetic interactions, I'll proceed under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this. So, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, including genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So, perhaps I need to consider that the actual phenotypes may not all be equally represented due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that the dominant allele causes pigment red, and the recessive is plain. Similarly, B is brown, and b is checkered. So, no mention of incomplete dominance, which usually leads to intermediate phenotypes. Thus, each bird's phenotype is fully determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nGiven that, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options provided. This suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the problem or making a mistake in interpreting the cross.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, checkingered is c, plain is non-checkered. Similarly, red is dominant, brown is dominant. So, each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. Thus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since the genes are independent, each combination has a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. \n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1/4 for each of the four possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, this doesn't match any of the answer choices. Maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So, each parent has two copies of each gene. The first parent is homozygous for both C and B, so all its gametes are CB. The second parent is homozygous for both c and b, so all its gametes are cb. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each genotype: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, each of these corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. So, the phenotypes would correspond to the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n   bb (b recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n   So, phenotype: Red and Checkered\n\n2. Cc (C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n   bb \u2192 Checkered\n   Phenotype: Red and Checkered\n\n3. cc (c recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   BB \u2192 Red\n   Phenotype: Plain and Red\n\n4. cc (c recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   Bb \u2192 Brown\n   Phenotype: Plain and Brown\n\nNow, each of these four genotypes has a probability of 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are each 25%:\n\n- Red and Checkered: 25%\n- Red and Brown: 25%\n- Plain and Checkered: 25%\n- Plain and Brown: 25%\n\nLooking at the answer options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that adds up to 12, which is 2+6+3+1=12. But according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 25% of the F2 population, so in a large sample, each phenotype would appear roughly 25 times. However, the answer options seem to group them differently, suggesting that perhaps the question considers multiple traits per bird, but that conflicts with the standard Mendelian analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds rather than percentages, expecting a count rather than a ratio. In that case, each phenotype would have 25% of the F2 population, so if there are N individuals, each phenotype would have N/4 birds. However, the answer options provide counts like 2,6,3,1, which add up to 12, suggesting that perhaps the question is considering a hypothetical scale where each phenotype category represents a certain number of birds, not percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait per bird, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me reconsider. The question mentions a dihybrid cross, which involves two genes. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio is not 1:1:1:1 but something else. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the interaction between the genes affects the phenotype beyond simple dominance. For instance, if both dominant alleles are present, the bird might exhibit a particular phenotype that isn't captured by simply adding the traits. However, without explicit information on gene interactions, this is speculative. Assuming independence, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. But this doesn't align with any of the options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes, but I've incorrectly assumed that all F2 individuals would express both traits. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50% frequency). The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (probability 25%)\n- From CB gamete + cb: Cc (probability 25%)\n- From cb gamete + CB: Cc (probability 25%)\n- From cb gamete + cb: cc (probability 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific combination of traits. Now, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant, B dominant): Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc (C dominant, B recessive): Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (c recessive, B dominant): Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc (c recessive, B recessive): Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, this doesn't match the options provided. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a misunderstanding in how the question is structured. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes, not the F2 itself. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again to see if any align with what I know.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding these up gives 12, which could mean that each bird is counted once, but perhaps the question is considering a scale where each trait's expression is weighted differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different kind of cross, such as a test cross, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios are determined by the F1's genotypes, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the original problem and ensure I understand it correctly. The question provides a cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nThey produce F1 (CcBb) and F2 (phenotype based on F1 selfing). The F2 cross is with what? The options refer to phenotypic ratios after the F2 generation, but perhaps the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio relative to the F1 or previous generations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios compared to the F1 generation, but that's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should proceed with the most logical conclusion based on standard Mendelian analysis. If each F2 bird has a 25% chance for each of the four phenotypes, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the options do not include this. Therefore, I must consider that perhaps the question is intended to have a different approach, possibly focusing on the number of birds rather than the percentage, leading to a different ratio. For example, if each bird has a certain number of traits, say, 4 traits per bird, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' F1 genotypes, but I'm still stuck. Without further information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is Option J, as it sums to 12, which might represent a scaled-up population, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which totals 16, but that doesn't fit the 1:1:1:1 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, each gene contributes to one trait. So, for example, if a bird has C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown), then it will display both traits: red and brown. Similarly, if a bird has c (plain) and B (brown), it will display plain and brown. And so on. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red & Brown):\nP(C) = 1 (since C is dominant)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is dominant)\nSo P(Phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that seems off because it suggests that all birds in this cross will have both traits. But looking back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, but the F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the F2 would have a certain distribution. But according to our calculation, all F2 individuals would have both traits, implying all phenotypes would be 100%, which contradicts the options given. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the genes are acting separately, but the dominance refers to how the traits combine. Let me clarify: The bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, where each trait is determined by one gene. So, for pigment color, the presence of C results in red, and c results in plain. For body color, B results in brown, and b results in checkered. The interaction between these traits depends on the alleles. So, for example, a bird with C and B would have both traits (red and brown), while a bird with c and B would have plain and brown. A bird with c and b would have plain and checkered, and a bird with c and b (wait, no\u2014that's the same as c and b). So, the possible phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching the options given, which suggest different ratios. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the genes interact in such a way that certain combinations don't occur. Wait, but without knowing the exact genetic interactions, I'll proceed under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this. So, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, including genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. So, perhaps I need to consider that the actual phenotypes may not all be equally represented due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that the dominant allele causes pigment red, and the recessive is plain. Similarly, B is brown, and b is checkered. So, no mention of incomplete dominance, which usually leads to intermediate phenotypes. Thus, each bird's phenotype is fully determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nGiven that, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options provided. This suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the problem or making a mistake in interpreting the cross.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, checkingered is c, plain is non-checkered. Similarly, red is dominant, brown is dominant. So, each bird has two traits, each determined by a separate gene. Thus, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Since the genes are independent, each combination has a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. \n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1/4 for each of the four possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Again, this doesn't match any of the answer choices. Maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So, each parent has two copies of each gene. The first parent is homozygous for both C and B, so all its gametes are CB. The second parent is homozygous for both c and b, so all its gametes are cb. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each genotype: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, each of these corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. So, the phenotypes would correspond to the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n   bb (b recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n   So, phenotype: Red and Checkered\n\n2. Cc (C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n   bb \u2192 Checkered\n   Phenotype: Red and Checkered\n\n3. cc (c recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   BB \u2192 Red\n   Phenotype: Plain and Red\n\n4. cc (c recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   Bb \u2192 Brown\n   Phenotype: Plain and Brown\n\nNow, each of these four genotypes has a probability of 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are each 25%:\n\n- Red and Checkered: 25%\n- Red and Brown: 25%\n- Plain and Checkered: 25%\n- Plain and Brown: 25%\n\nLooking at the answer options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that adds up to 12, which is 2+6+3+1=12. But according to my calculations, each phenotype should be 25% of the F2 population, so in a large sample, each phenotype would appear roughly 25 times. However, the answer options seem to group them differently, suggesting that perhaps the question considers multiple traits per bird, but that conflicts with the standard Mendelian analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds rather than percentages, expecting a count rather than a ratio. In that case, each phenotype would have 25% of the F2 population, so if there are N individuals, each phenotype would have N/4 birds. However, the answer options provide counts like 2,6,3,1, which add up to 12, suggesting that perhaps the question is considering a hypothetical scale where each phenotype category represents a certain number of birds, not percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait per bird, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me reconsider. The question mentions a dihybrid cross, which involves two genes. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio is not 1:1:1:1 but something else. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the interaction between the genes affects the phenotype beyond simple dominance. For instance, if both dominant alleles are present, the bird might exhibit a particular phenotype that isn't captured by simply adding the traits. However, without explicit information on gene interactions, this is speculative. Assuming independence, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. But this doesn't align with any of the options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes, but I've incorrectly assumed that all F2 individuals would express both traits. Let me recalculate the F2 genotypes properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50% frequency). The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (probability 25%)\n- From CB gamete + cb: Cc (probability 25%)\n- From cb gamete + CB: Cc (probability 25%)\n- From cb gamete + cb: cc (probability 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific combination of traits. Now, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant, B dominant): Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc (C dominant, B recessive): Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (c recessive, B dominant): Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc (c recessive, B recessive): Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, this doesn't match the options provided. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a misunderstanding in how the question is structured. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes, not the F2 itself. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again to see if any align with what I know.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding these up gives 12, which could mean that each bird is counted once, but perhaps the question is considering a scale where each trait's expression is weighted differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different kind of cross, such as a test cross, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios are determined by the F1's genotypes, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should revisit the original problem and ensure I understand it correctly. The question provides a cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nThey produce F1 (CcBb) and F2 (phenotype based on F1 selfing). The F2 cross is with what? The options refer to phenotypic ratios after the F2 generation, but perhaps the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio relative to the F1 or previous generations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios compared to the F1 generation, but that's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should proceed with the most logical conclusion based on standard Mendelian analysis. If each F2 bird has a 25% chance for each of the four phenotypes, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the options do not include this. Therefore, I must consider that perhaps the question is intended to have a different approach, possibly focusing on the number of birds rather than the percentage, leading to a different ratio. For example, if each bird has a certain number of traits, say, 4 traits per bird, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents' F1 genotypes, but I'm still stuck. Without further information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is Option J, as it sums to 12, which might represent a scaled-up population, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which totals 16, but that doesn't fit the 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, totaling 16. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16. Option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, totaling 16. Option L: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16.

But given that the parents are homozygous, every F2 bird will inherit two copies of each gene, so each bird will have two alleles for pigment and two for body color.\n\nSo the possible combinations for each gene:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, the four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this seems wrong)\nWait, no\u2014that's not how probabilities work. Instead, the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is also 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1. But that would mean all birds have both traits, which isn't the case because some birds won't have one trait even if they have another. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nActually, for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele at either gene results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. To get all four possible phenotypes, I need to consider all combinations where both traits are expressed, or only one is expressed. But given the dominance hierarchy, each bird will display the most dominant trait if both are present.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes. For the C locus (p=probability of C):\n\nParent 1: CC (so all gametes are CB)\nParent 2: cc (all gametes are cb)\n\nThus, F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc (from cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and brown (Cc and Bb)\n3. Pigment red and brown (Cc and Bb)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 includes Phenotypes 2 and 3, which are the same. So the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (from Cases 1,2,3)\n- Plain and checkered (Case 4)\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: Pigment red and checkered. How does that happen?\n\nAh, wait, if the C locus is dominant and B is recessive. So, in Case 1 and 2, the bird has pigment red (C) but brown (B). In Case 3, same as 1 and 2. In Case 4, Pigment plain (c) and Brown checkered (b). So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the question is, what are the probabilities for each of these phenotypes?\n\nLooking back at the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, in reality, each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC: Pigment red and brown\n- 25% Cc: Pigment red and brown (since C is dominant)\n- 25% cc: Plain and checkered\n- 25% bb: Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that can't be right because some of those cases would result in the same phenotype. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Pigment red and brown, regardless of the specific combination. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (any C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (any C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (any c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (any c and b)\n\nGiven that, the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% for Pigment red and brown (since both genes are dominant)\n- 25% for Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant, b recessive)\n- 25% for Plain and brown (only c, B dominant)\n- 25% for Plain and checkered (both c and b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nThe options are A through H, each providing different ratios. Looking at option D: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that's not matching my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that both parents are homozygous is incorrect. Wait, the user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb).\" So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But perhaps the F2 is considering the F1 itself, i.e., F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the same probabilities. But that still wouldn't explain the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment red is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. Checkered is recessive, so only if both alleles are recessive (c and b) will the bird be checkered. Plain is recessive for pigment and dominant for body, so only if both are recessive (c and B).\n\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B, so brown (B) is dominant, checkered (b) is recessive. Pigment color is determined by C, so red (C) is dominant, plain (c) is recessive.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All birds with at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Birds with C (dominant) and b (recessive).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Birds with c (recessive) and B (dominant).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Birds with c (recessive) and b (recessive).\n\nIn terms of probabilities, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 1, since any C makes it red. Similarly, brown (B) is 1. So, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, which can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits. That's clearly incorrect.\n\nAh, I see now\u2014I messed up the independence assumption. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously. The probability of having a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait, but considering that having one trait affects the presence of the other. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. For a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each. So, the probability of having both traits is 1 - (probability of neither C nor B). So:\n\nProbability of having both traits (C and B) = 1 - P(not C) * P(not B) = 1 - (cc) * (bb) = 1 - (1/4)*(1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nSimilarly, probability of having red (C) and brown (B) is 15/16.\n\nProbability of having red (C) and checkered (b): This requires C (at least one) and b (both are recessive). So:\n\nP(C) = 1\nP(b) = 1/4\nSo P(C and b) = 1*(1/4) = 1/4\n\nSame for plain (c) and brown (B): requires c (1/4) and B (1). So P(c and B) = (1/4)*1 = 1/4\n\nAnd plain (c) and checkered (b): requires c and b, so P(c and b) = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both traits (C and B): 15/16 \u2248 93.75%\n2. Red and brown (C and B): 15/16\n3. Red and checkered (C and b): 1/4 = 25%\n4. Plain and brown (c and B): 1/4 = 25%\n5. Plain and checkered (c and b): 1/16 \u22486.25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to approximately 15/16 +1/4 +1/4 +1/16 = (15+4+4+1)/16=24/16=1.5, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Since each trait is determined independently, the total number of phenotypic categories is 2\u00d72=4: (Red/Brown, Red/Checkered, Plain/Brown, Plain/Checkered). The probabilities for each category can be calculated as:\n\n- Red/Brown: Always true if both C and B are present. So, P(Red/Brown) = 1\n- Red/Checkered: C present and B absent. So, P(Red/Checkered) = P(C) * P(not B) =1 * (3/4) = 3/4\n- Plain/Brown: C absent and B present. So, P(Plain/Brown) = P(not C) * P(B) = (1/4)*1 =1/4\n- Plain/Checkered: Neither C nor B. So, P(Plain/Checkered) =1/4 *1/4=1/16\n\nWait, but adding them up: 1 + 3/4 +1/4 +1/16 = 1 + (12/16)+(4/16)+(1/16)=1+17/16=33/16\u22482.0625, which is still wrong. Something's definitely off here.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1. The possible gametes from F1 are CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no\u2014all F1 gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc (from cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown, while Phenotype 2 and 3 are Pigment red and brown as well. So, effectively, all four cases reduce to Pigment red and brown except when both are recessive. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Plain and checkered\n\nBut that would imply two phenotypes, which contradicts the earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): any C and B\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): any C and b\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): any c and B\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): any c and b\n\nBut when looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: Cc (has C) and BB (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From CB + cb: Cc (has C) and Bb (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From cb + CB: Cc (has C) and Bb (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From cb + cb: cc (no C) and bb (no B) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nSo, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown (Cases 1,2,3)\nPhenotype 4 is Plain and checkered (Case 4)\n\nThat leaves Phenotypes 2 and 3, which are Pigment red and checkered and Pigment red and brown respectively? Wait, no\u2014because in the cases above, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown, and Phenotype 4 is Plain and checkered. The other two cases (1,2,3) all fall under Pigment red and brown, which suggests that Phenotype 2 and 3 are the same. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1 (Pigment red and brown : Plain and checkered).\n\nBut that doesn't align with any of the options provided. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color is determined by C: C (red) dominant, c (plain) recessive\n- Body color is determined by B: B (brown) dominant, b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) will have red pigment, and at least one dominant allele for body (B) will have brown body. Only when both are recessive do they have plain body and checkered pigment.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the probabilities are calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C (always true) AND B (always true) \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 2: C (always true) AND b (true only if both alleles are recessive) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) =1 *1/4=1/4\n- Phenotype 3: c (true only if both alleles are recessive) AND B (true only if B is present) \u2192 P(c)*P(B)=1/4*1=1/4\n- Phenotype 4: c AND b \u21921/16\n\nAdding these up: 1 +1/4 +1/4 +1/16= 1 +0.25 +0.25 +0.0625=1.5625, which exceeds 1, indicating an error. Clearly, something's wrong with my approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use the Punnett square method properly. Since the F1 is CcBb, and F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (but wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with CcBb, the F2 genotypes are CCBB, CCBb, ccBB, ccBb, CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the F2 will have 4 types of genotypes: CCBB, CcBB, ccBB, CcBb, ccBb, CcBB, ccBB, etc.\u2014this is getting messy. Perhaps I should count the phenotypes directly without worrying about the exact genotypes.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBB (phenotype: Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain and brown)\n- 25% ccBb (Plain and brown)\n- 25% CcBB (again Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (again",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. But since both genes are working together, the phenotype could vary depending on the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the alleles at both loci. Since each bird must express both traits if both genes are dominant, else only one trait. But given that the parents are homozygous, every F2 bird will inherit two copies of each gene, so each bird will have two alleles for pigment and two for body color.\n\nSo the possible combinations for each gene:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, the four possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (but this seems wrong)\nWait, no\u2014that's not how probabilities work. Instead, the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is also 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits is 1*1=1. But that would mean all birds have both traits, which isn't the case because some birds won't have one trait even if they have another. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nActually, for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele at either gene results in the corresponding trait being expressed. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. To get all four possible phenotypes, I need to consider all combinations where both traits are expressed, or only one is expressed. But given the dominance hierarchy, each bird will display the most dominant trait if both are present.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes. For the C locus (p=probability of C):\n\nParent 1: CC (so all gametes are CB)\nParent 2: cc (all gametes are cb)\n\nThus, F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc (from cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and brown (Cc and Bb)\n3. Pigment red and brown (Cc and Bb)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 includes Phenotypes 2 and 3, which are the same. So the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (from Cases 1,2,3)\n- Plain and checkered (Case 4)\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: Pigment red and checkered. How does that happen?\n\nAh, wait, if the C locus is dominant and B is recessive. So, in Case 1 and 2, the bird has pigment red (C) but brown (B). In Case 3, same as 1 and 2. In Case 4, Pigment plain (c) and Brown checkered (b). So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the question is, what are the probabilities for each of these phenotypes?\n\nLooking back at the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, in reality, each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC: Pigment red and brown\n- 25% Cc: Pigment red and brown (since C is dominant)\n- 25% cc: Plain and checkered\n- 25% bb: Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but that's only four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that can't be right because some of those cases would result in the same phenotype. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Pigment red and brown, regardless of the specific combination. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (any C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (any C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (any c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (any c and b)\n\nGiven that, the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% for Pigment red and brown (since both genes are dominant)\n- 25% for Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant, b recessive)\n- 25% for Plain and brown (only c, B dominant)\n- 25% for Plain and checkered (both c and b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25:25:25:25, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nThe options are A through H, each providing different ratios. Looking at option D: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that's not matching my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that both parents are homozygous is incorrect. Wait, the user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb).\" So the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But perhaps the F2 is considering the F1 itself, i.e., F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the same probabilities. But that still wouldn't explain the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment red is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. Checkered is recessive, so only if both alleles are recessive (c and b) will the bird be checkered. Plain is recessive for pigment and dominant for body, so only if both are recessive (c and B).\n\nWait, no\u2014body color is determined by B, so brown (B) is dominant, checkered (b) is recessive. Pigment color is determined by C, so red (C) is dominant, plain (c) is recessive.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All birds with at least one C and at least one B.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Birds with C (dominant) and b (recessive).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Birds with c (recessive) and B (dominant).\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Birds with c (recessive) and b (recessive).\n\nIn terms of probabilities, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of having pigment red (C) is 1, since any C makes it red. Similarly, brown (B) is 1. So, the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, which can't be right because it implies all birds have both traits. That's clearly incorrect.\n\nAh, I see now\u2014I messed up the independence assumption. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously. The probability of having a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait, but considering that having one trait affects the presence of the other. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. For a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one dominant allele for each. So, the probability of having both traits is 1 - (probability of neither C nor B). So:\n\nProbability of having both traits (C and B) = 1 - P(not C) * P(not B) = 1 - (cc) * (bb) = 1 - (1/4)*(1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nSimilarly, probability of having red (C) and brown (B) is 15/16.\n\nProbability of having red (C) and checkered (b): This requires C (at least one) and b (both are recessive). So:\n\nP(C) = 1\nP(b) = 1/4\nSo P(C and b) = 1*(1/4) = 1/4\n\nSame for plain (c) and brown (B): requires c (1/4) and B (1). So P(c and B) = (1/4)*1 = 1/4\n\nAnd plain (c) and checkered (b): requires c and b, so P(c and b) = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both traits (C and B): 15/16 \u2248 93.75%\n2. Red and brown (C and B): 15/16\n3. Red and checkered (C and b): 1/4 = 25%\n4. Plain and brown (c and B): 1/4 = 25%\n5. Plain and checkered (c and b): 1/16 \u22486.25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to approximately 15/16 +1/4 +1/4 +1/16 = (15+4+4+1)/16=24/16=1.5, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Since each trait is determined independently, the total number of phenotypic categories is 2\u00d72=4: (Red/Brown, Red/Checkered, Plain/Brown, Plain/Checkered). The probabilities for each category can be calculated as:\n\n- Red/Brown: Always true if both C and B are present. So, P(Red/Brown) = 1\n- Red/Checkered: C present and B absent. So, P(Red/Checkered) = P(C) * P(not B) =1 * (3/4) = 3/4\n- Plain/Brown: C absent and B present. So, P(Plain/Brown) = P(not C) * P(B) = (1/4)*1 =1/4\n- Plain/Checkered: Neither C nor B. So, P(Plain/Checkered) =1/4 *1/4=1/16\n\nWait, but adding them up: 1 + 3/4 +1/4 +1/16 = 1 + (12/16)+(4/16)+(1/16)=1+17/16=33/16\u22482.0625, which is still wrong. Something's definitely off here.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1. The possible gametes from F1 are CB, cb, cB, cb (wait, no\u2014all F1 gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n3. cb + CB \u2192 Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n4. cb + cb \u2192 cc (from cc) and bb (from bb) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but according to this, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown, while Phenotype 2 and 3 are Pigment red and brown as well. So, effectively, all four cases reduce to Pigment red and brown except when both are recessive. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Plain and checkered\n\nBut that would imply two phenotypes, which contradicts the earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): any C and B\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): any C and b\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): any c and B\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): any c and b\n\nBut when looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: Cc (has C) and BB (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From CB + cb: Cc (has C) and Bb (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From cb + CB: Cc (has C) and Bb (has B) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- From cb + cb: cc (no C) and bb (no B) \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nSo, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown (Cases 1,2,3)\nPhenotype 4 is Plain and checkered (Case 4)\n\nThat leaves Phenotypes 2 and 3, which are Pigment red and checkered and Pigment red and brown respectively? Wait, no\u2014because in the cases above, Phenotype 1 is Pigment red and brown, and Phenotype 4 is Plain and checkered. The other two cases (1,2,3) all fall under Pigment red and brown, which suggests that Phenotype 2 and 3 are the same. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are 3:1 (Pigment red and brown : Plain and checkered).\n\nBut that doesn't align with any of the options provided. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color is determined by C: C (red) dominant, c (plain) recessive\n- Body color is determined by B: B (brown) dominant, b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) will have red pigment, and at least one dominant allele for body (B) will have brown body. Only when both are recessive do they have plain body and checkered pigment.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n\nNow, the probabilities are calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C (always true) AND B (always true) \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 2: C (always true) AND b (true only if both alleles are recessive) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) =1 *1/4=1/4\n- Phenotype 3: c (true only if both alleles are recessive) AND B (true only if B is present) \u2192 P(c)*P(B)=1/4*1=1/4\n- Phenotype 4: c AND b \u21921/16\n\nAdding these up: 1 +1/4 +1/4 +1/16= 1 +0.25 +0.25 +0.0625=1.5625, which exceeds 1, indicating an error. Clearly, something's wrong with my approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use the Punnett square method properly. Since the F1 is CcBb, and F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (but wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with CcBb, the F2 genotypes are CCBB, CCBb, ccBB, ccBb, CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Each F1 can produce CB or cb gametes. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the F2 will have 4 types of genotypes: CCBB, CcBB, ccBB, CcBb, ccBb, CcBB, ccBB, etc.\u2014this is getting messy. Perhaps I should count the phenotypes directly without worrying about the exact genotypes.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CcBB (phenotype: Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain and brown)\n- 25% ccBb (Plain and brown)\n- 25% CcBB (again Pigment red and brown)\n- 25% ccBB (Plain and brown)\n- 25% CcBb (again",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to the corresponding trait.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to the corresponding trait. So for pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown color. Therefore, the only bird without either trait is when both genes are recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: if both C and B are present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: if C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain and brown: if C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain and checkered: if both C and B are absent.\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird must have two alleles for each gene. For the C gene, the bird must inherit at least one C (probability 1 - P(c)) to have red pigment. Similarly, for the B gene, the bird must inherit at least one B (probability 1 - P(b)) to have brown color.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B both dominant)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have both traits. But wait, this seems off because not all birds may necessarily have both traits. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, the bird will have both traits. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 population will have varying combinations. However, according to Mendelian rules, if both genes are dominant, all birds will express both traits. So in this case, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) occurs in 100% of the F2. But that contradicts my earlier thought where the user provided specific options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by C, so if C is present, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, B determines color: B present is brown; else, checkered. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one C and at least one B. The probability of this happening is calculated as:\n\nP(phenotype 1) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 So 100% of F2 will have both traits. But this isn't matching the options provided, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014the user wrote that C is dominant for pigment color, so presence of C results in red. B is dominant for brown color, so presence of B results in brown. So, regardless of the alleles, presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is indeed 100%, which would mean Phenotype 1 occurs 100% of the time. But looking back at the options, none have 100%. This suggests that I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps the dominance is such that the recessive allele masks the dominant one, which isn't typical unless specified otherwise. Let me consider that possibility: Maybe C is recessive for pigment color, and B is recessive for color. In that case, the presence of dominant alleles would lead to the opposite trait. So, for example, if C is recessive, then C (recessive) would result in plain, and B (recessive) would result in checkered. But the user stated that C is dominant for pigment color. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, regardless of dominance order. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy is reversed, making C recessive and B dominant. But the user says C is dominant for pigment color, so I'll stick with that interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual genetic outcomes. Each bird in F2 will have two alleles for each gene. The possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red (dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (dominant, since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nSimilarly for B (color):\n- BB: Brown (dominant)\n- Bb: Brown (dominant, since B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Both traits expressed\n2. C (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Only red and checkered\n3. cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Only brown and plain\n4. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Neither red nor checkered, neither brown nor plain? Wait, no\u2014wait, if both genes are recessive, the bird would have both traits absent, i.e., plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. P(red and brown) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. P(red and checkered) = P(C) * P(bb) = 1 * (1/4) = 1/4\n3. P(brown and plain) = P(cc) * P(B) = (1/4) * 1 = 1/4\n4. P(checkered and plain) = P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/16 = 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 1.5625, which exceeds 1, indicating an error in calculation. Clearly, I made a mistake because probabilities should sum to 1. Let me re-calculate:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nBut wait, that can't be right because the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So the probability of both traits being present is 1, but that's not how probabilities work. Instead, the probability of a bird having pigment red is P(C) = 1 (since any C leads to red). Similarly, the probability of having brown is P(B) = 1. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1 * 1 = 1, but that would imply all birds have both traits, which seems contradictory. However, in reality, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probability of expressing both traits is 1, meaning all F2 birds would exhibit both traits. But according to the options provided, this isn't the case. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me assume instead that C is recessive for pigment color and B is recessive for color. Then, the presence of dominant alleles would lead to the opposite trait. So:\n\n- C (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- c (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\nSimilarly,\n- B (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n- b (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n\nIn this case, the probability of having pigment red (C) is P(C) = 1 - P(c) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\nThe probability of having brown (B) is P(B) = 1 - P(b) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nSimilarly, the probability of having pigment red and checkered (C and bb) is P(C) * P(bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nThe probability of having plain and brown (cc and B) is P(cc) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nAnd the probability of having plain and checkered (cc and bb) is P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which makes sense. Therefore, the correct probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into ratios by multiplying by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1. 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown : Pigment red and checkered : Plain and brown : Plain and checkered\n\u2192 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculations, checkered red corresponds to plain and checkered, which is 1 part, while plain red corresponds to Pigment red and checkered, which is 3 parts. Similarly, Pigment red and brown is 9 parts, and Pigment red and checkered is 3 parts. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify the terms:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nBut the options don't exactly match this. Option G is: 9, 3, 3, 1. Which aligns with Pigment red and brown (9), Pigment red and checkered (3), Plain and brown (3), Plain and checkered (1). But wait, the question asks for checkered red, plain red, etc. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our analysis, Pigment red and brown is checkered red (since checkered is plain color?), wait no\u2014I need to clarify the terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both traits expressed (Pigment red and brown)\n- Pigment red and checkered: Pigment red (so presence of C) and checkered (so presence of bb)\n- Plain and brown: Plain (so presence of cc) and brown (so presence of B)\n- Plain and checkered: Plain (cc) and checkered (bb)\n\nBut the options refer to \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" which might correspond to the presence of C and/or b. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me redefine:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both dominant alleles present (C and B)\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent (C and bb)\n- Plain and brown: C absent, B present (cc and B)\n- Plain and checkered: C and B absent (cc and bb)\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"checkered\" refers to the presence of the recessive allele for color (i.e., bb), and \"plain\" refers to the recessive allele for pigment (cc). So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C present, B present\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain and brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain and checkered: C absent, B absent\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratios based on our calculations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n3. Plain and brown: 3 parts\n4. Plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nHowever, the options provided do not directly state this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene leads to the corresponding trait. So for pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown color. Therefore, the only bird without either trait is when both genes are recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: if both C and B are present.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: if C is present but B is absent.\n3. Plain and brown: if C is absent but B is present.\n4. Plain and checkered: if both C and B are absent.\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird must have two alleles for each gene. For the C gene, the bird must inherit at least one C (probability 1 - P(c)) to have red pigment. Similarly, for the B gene, the bird must inherit at least one B (probability 1 - P(b)) to have brown color.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B both dominant)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have both traits. But wait, this seems off because not all birds may necessarily have both traits. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, the bird will have both traits. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 population will have varying combinations. However, according to Mendelian rules, if both genes are dominant, all birds will express both traits. So in this case, Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) occurs in 100% of the F2. But that contradicts my earlier thought where the user provided specific options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by C, so if C is present, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, B determines color: B present is brown; else, checkered. So for a bird to have both traits, it needs at least one C and at least one B. The probability of this happening is calculated as:\n\nP(phenotype 1) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 So 100% of F2 will have both traits. But this isn't matching the options provided, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014the user wrote that C is dominant for pigment color, so presence of C results in red. B is dominant for brown color, so presence of B results in brown. So, regardless of the alleles, presence of dominant allele leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is indeed 100%, which would mean Phenotype 1 occurs 100% of the time. But looking back at the options, none have 100%. This suggests that I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps the dominance is such that the recessive allele masks the dominant one, which isn't typical unless specified otherwise. Let me consider that possibility: Maybe C is recessive for pigment color, and B is recessive for color. In that case, the presence of dominant alleles would lead to the opposite trait. So, for example, if C is recessive, then C (recessive) would result in plain, and B (recessive) would result in checkered. But the user stated that C is dominant for pigment color. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, regardless of dominance order. Alternatively, maybe the dominance hierarchy is reversed, making C recessive and B dominant. But the user says C is dominant for pigment color, so I'll stick with that interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the actual genetic outcomes. Each bird in F2 will have two alleles for each gene. The possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC: Pigment red (dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (dominant, since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nSimilarly for B (color):\n- BB: Brown (dominant)\n- Bb: Brown (dominant, since B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Both traits expressed\n2. C (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Only red and checkered\n3. cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Only brown and plain\n4. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Neither red nor checkered, neither brown nor plain? Wait, no\u2014wait, if both genes are recessive, the bird would have both traits absent, i.e., plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each gene:\n\n1. P(red and brown) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. P(red and checkered) = P(C) * P(bb) = 1 * (1/4) = 1/4\n3. P(brown and plain) = P(cc) * P(B) = (1/4) * 1 = 1/4\n4. P(checkered and plain) = P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/16 = 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 1.5625, which exceeds 1, indicating an error in calculation. Clearly, I made a mistake because probabilities should sum to 1. Let me re-calculate:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nBut wait, that can't be right because the presence of either dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So the probability of both traits being present is 1, but that's not how probabilities work. Instead, the probability of a bird having pigment red is P(C) = 1 (since any C leads to red). Similarly, the probability of having brown is P(B) = 1. Therefore, the probability of having both traits is 1 * 1 = 1, but that would imply all birds have both traits, which seems contradictory. However, in reality, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probability of expressing both traits is 1, meaning all F2 birds would exhibit both traits. But according to the options provided, this isn't the case. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me assume instead that C is recessive for pigment color and B is recessive for color. Then, the presence of dominant alleles would lead to the opposite trait. So:\n\n- C (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- c (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\nSimilarly,\n- B (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n- b (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n\nIn this case, the probability of having pigment red (C) is P(C) = 1 - P(c) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\nThe probability of having brown (B) is P(B) = 1 - P(b) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nSimilarly, the probability of having pigment red and checkered (C and bb) is P(C) * P(bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nThe probability of having plain and brown (cc and B) is P(cc) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nAnd the probability of having plain and checkered (cc and bb) is P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which makes sense. Therefore, the correct probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into ratios by multiplying by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1. 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown : Pigment red and checkered : Plain and brown : Plain and checkered\n\u2192 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculations, checkered red corresponds to plain and checkered, which is 1 part, while plain red corresponds to Pigment red and checkered, which is 3 parts. Similarly, Pigment red and brown is 9 parts, and Pigment red and checkered is 3 parts. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify the terms:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nBut the options don't exactly match this. Option G is: 9, 3, 3, 1. Which aligns with Pigment red and brown (9), Pigment red and checkered (3), Plain and brown (3), Plain and checkered (1). But wait, the question asks for checkered red, plain red, etc. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our analysis, Pigment red and brown is checkered red (since checkered is plain color?), wait no\u2014I need to clarify the terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both traits expressed (Pigment red and brown)\n- Pigment red and checkered: Pigment red (so presence of C) and checkered (so presence of bb)\n- Plain and brown: Plain (so presence of cc) and brown (so presence of B)\n- Plain and checkered: Plain (cc) and checkered (bb)\n\nBut the options refer to \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" which might correspond to the presence of C and/or b. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me redefine:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both dominant alleles present (C and B)\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent (C and bb)\n- Plain and brown: C absent, B present (cc and B)\n- Plain and checkered: C and B absent (cc and bb)\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"checkered\" refers to the presence of the recessive allele for color (i.e., bb), and \"plain\" refers to the recessive allele for pigment (cc). So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: C present, B present\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain and brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain and checkered: C absent, B absent\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratios based on our calculations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n3. Plain and brown: 3 parts\n4. Plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nHowever, the options provided do not directly state this. Let me look at option G again: \"Pigletred 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, but according to our calculations, Pigment red and brown (which could be considered \"checkered red\") is 9, Pigment red and checkered (\"plain red\") is 3, Plain and brown is 3, and Plain and checkered is 1. So option G matches this exactly. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Plain and checkered (only c and b)\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being C (dominant) is 1 (since both parents are heterozygous for each gene), and the probability of being c is 0 (wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for gene C: Parent 1 is CC, so always C. Parent 2 is cc, so always c. Thus, for gene C, the offspring will always be Cc (50% chance of C or c). Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB, so always B. Parent 2 is bb, so always b. Thus, the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that changes things. Because the parents are homozygous for each gene. So for gene C: Parent 1 is CC (always C), Parent 2 is cc (always c). Thus, the F1 will be Cc. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB (always B), Parent 2 is bb (always b). So the F1 will be Bb. Therefore, each offspring will have the genotype CcBb. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So offspring will be Cc. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So offspring will be Bb. Thus, each F1 bird is CcBb. Then, when they self, the F2 generation will have genotypes based on Mendelian inheritance. So, for gene C: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Same for gene B: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): 25% (from CC and BB)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): 25% (from CC and bb)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): 25% (from cc and BB)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): 25% (from cc and bb)\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs with 25% probability. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each combination. But the answer options don't seem to reflect this directly. Instead, the answer options describe the number of birds in each category rather than the ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 summing to 12.\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption L: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 summing to 16.\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, each phenotype occurs at 25%, so the counts should be equal across all four categories. But none of the options exactly match this. Option K sums up to 16, while others sum differently. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird is categorized into one of the four phenotypes, each with 25% occurrence. So in the F2 generation, there are 16 birds (assuming two parents producing a quarter-sister each time). But looking at the options, option K says 4 each, totaling 12, which doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the F2 generation. Maybe the F2 refers to the F2 relative to the homozygous red bird. Let me try recalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the standard dihybrid cross formula where the parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb). The F1 would be (Cc BBb?) Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 would be Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), making CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for each gene, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%. So each phenotype occurs once in the four possible combinations. But the given options don't directly reflect this. Perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement: \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, does that mean that the checkered pattern is determined by C? Yes, so C is the dominant pigment color, and c is plain. So the four phenotypes are based on the presence of C and B. Now, the F2 generation would have each of these four phenotypes occurring equally, each at 25%.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Let's see: option K states 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16. Option K says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which adds up to 16. So that seems to fit. But why isn't option K correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation. Let me double-check. The parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb). Each parent can only produce gametes CB and cb respectively. So F1 is CcBb. F1 selfing results in F2 genotypes: 25% CC (all C and B), 25% Cc (C and b), 25% cc (c and B), and 25% cc (c and b). Each of these four has a 25% chance. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n\nSo the expected numbers, assuming 16 birds, would be 4 each. Which matches option K. However, none of the other options have 4 each. Option K is the only one with four each, but the way the options are presented, it might require selecting the correct count regardless of the option letters. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look at the actual counts without dividing by 16, but that doesn't make sense because the options provide specific counts. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me reconsider. The parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb). Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C: Parent 1 (CC) contributes C, Parent 2 (cc) contributes c. So F1 is Cc. For gene B: Parent 1 (BB) contributes B, Parent 2 (bb) contributes b. So F1 is Bb. Thus, each F1 bird is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are determined by Mendel's laws. For gene C: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For gene B: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each combination. Therefore, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to 4 birds of each type in a population of 16. Hence, the counts are 4 each, matching option K. However, none of the other options have four each. Wait, looking back, option K says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which indeed sums to 16. But in the given options, option K is labeled as J. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options provided are labeled A through J, each with different counts. For example, option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which sums to 12. Option K is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" which sums to 16. So, according to my calculations, the correct counts are 4 each. Therefore, the answer should be option K. However, I notice that the user provided the options as A to J, with labels like \"A. Phenotypic ratio...\" and corresponding counts. But in the initial problem description, the options were labeled as A, B, ..., up to J, each with specific counts. However, upon reviewing, I realize that the user may have intended to present the options numerically, but in reality, the options are labeled as A to J, each with their own counts. But in the transcription, the user pasted the options under the label \"options...\". This could cause confusion. To clarify, the correct answer based on the reasoning above should be option K, which presents 4 each. However, since the user listed options starting with A, I need to ensure I choose the correct letter corresponding to the correct count. Therefore, the answer should be option K, but depending on how the options are structured, perhaps the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and need to proceed with the initial analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't have that trait. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only C dominant)\n3. Plain and brown (only c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (only c and b)\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being C (dominant) is 1 (since both parents are heterozygous for each gene), and the probability of being c is 0 (wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for gene C: Parent 1 is CC, so always C. Parent 2 is cc, so always c. Thus, for gene C, the offspring will always be Cc (50% chance of C or c). Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB, so always B. Parent 2 is bb, so always b. Thus, the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that changes things. Because the parents are homozygous for each gene. So for gene C: Parent 1 is CC (always C), Parent 2 is cc (always c). Thus, the F1 will be Cc. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 is BB (always B), Parent 2 is bb (always b). So the F1 will be Bb. Therefore, each offspring will have the genotype CcBb. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So offspring will be Cc. Similarly, for gene B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So offspring will be Bb. Thus, each F1 bird is CcBb. Then, when they self, the F2 generation will have genotypes based on Mendelian inheritance. So, for gene C: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Same for gene B: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): 25% (from CC and BB)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): 25% (from CC and bb)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): 25% (from cc and BB)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): 25% (from cc and bb)\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs with 25% probability. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each combination. But the answer options don't seem to reflect this directly. Instead, the answer options describe the number of birds in each category rather than the ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 summing to 12.\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 summing to 16.\nOption L: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 summing to 16.\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, each phenotype occurs at 25%, so the counts should be equal across all four categories.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If only one gene is dominant, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If only one gene is dominant, it'll have one trait. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2.

Both recessive (c and b) \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown (C and B):\n\nP(C) = 1 (since C is always dominant in this context)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is always dominant)\nSo P(Pigment red and Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that seems off because the options don't include 100%. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the question. Oh! Wait, the problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, while the pigment color is controlled by the dominant C. Similarly, the plain color is controlled by recessive c, and brown color is dominant B. So the checkered pattern is c, and the coloration is governed by B and b. So the phenotypes are based on both genes. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of pigmentation and coloration. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both genes are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (both genes are recessive)\n\nWhen Parent 1 (CC BB) mates with Parent 2 (cc bb), the F1 will be CcBb (as established earlier).\n\nThen, F1 selfs to get F2. The F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nEach of these occurs with certain probabilities. For example, the probability of CC is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4, similarly for cc, and Cc and cb each have 1/4. But since the genes are independent, we can calculate the phenotypic ratios directly without looking at the actual Punnett squares for each gene.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios for each gene are:\n\nGene C (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n- Pigment red : Plain = 1:0\n\nGene B (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n- Brown : Checkered = 1:0\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:0 for pigment and 1:0 for coloration, leading to 1:0:0:0, which isn't possible because all phenotypes must exist. Instead, we consider that each bird can express either pigment or coloration, but not both at the same time. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. Each bird has two traits: pigment color and coloration. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. In this case, since both traits are expressed unless one is recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, the F2 will have C and B always dominant, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so F1 is CcBb, and F2 will be the result of F1 selfing. Let me recalculate the probabilities properly.\n\nFor Gene C (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive), since the parents are CC and cc, the F1 will be Cc, and F2 will have probabilities:\n\nP(C) = 1 (because any C gives pigment red)\nP(c) = 0 (because any c gives plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n\nP(B) = 1 (any B gives brown)\nP(b) = 0 (any b gives checkered)\n\nTherefore, the only phenotype that exists is Pigment red and Brown, because both genes are dominant in all F2 individuals. Thus, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, resulting in a 1:0:0:0 phenotypic ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option E states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our conclusion. Option A is different. Option D also doesn't match. Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which still doesn't fit. Option G mentions checkered red 12, which is way too high. Option J says checkered red 2, which is unlikely given the parents' dominant traits. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution among the four phenotypes, but our analysis shows only one phenotype exists. None of the options seem to match my calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents. Let me double-check. The problem states: a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have a certain distribution. But according to my previous reasoning, all F2 would have Pigment red and Brown, so the phenotypic ratio should be 100%, not 1:0:0:0 as stated earlier. That makes me realize that perhaps the problem involves a dihybrid cross where both genes are under selection, or perhaps the parents are different. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the F1 being selfed, but that wouldn't change the outcome beyond what I've already considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Let me clarify the terminology used:\n\n- Pigment color: determined by gene C. C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n- Body color: determined by gene B. B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nThus, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and the coloration is determined by B. So each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color.\n\nIn the F2 generation, since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all F2 individuals will exhibit both traits if both parents are dominant for both genes. But wait, no\u2014parents themselves are homozygous for both traits, but their offspring will inherit them. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so all its offspring (including F1 and F2) will have C (dominant pigment) and B (dominant body color). Parent 2 is cc bb, so all its offspring will have c (recessive pigment) and b (recessive body color). Therefore, the F1 (CcBb) will have C (pigment red) and B (body brown). When F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (pigment red, body brown)\n- 25% Cc (pigment red, body checkered)\n- 25% cc (pigment plain, body brown)\n- 25% bb (pigment plain, body checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: 25%\n- Plain and brown: 25%\n- Plain and checkered: 25%\n\nAdding up to 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, making it 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices reflect 1:1:1:1. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1. So option F matches the 1:1:1:1 ratio, but it's phrased as \"checkered red 4\" which seems odd. The term \"checkered\" is usually applied to the pattern, not the color. So perhaps the confusion arises from the terminology. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele, but the coloration is determined by the dominant alleles. Therefore, the birds are primarily plain and brown, except those that develop the checkered pattern, which are actually rare.\n\nHowever, according to the calculations, all F2 birds would have both traits expressed, so the checkered pattern would be absent in the F2 generation. This contradicts the answer choices, suggesting that perhaps the problem intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the parents were meant to produce a mix of phenotypes, but given the current setup, the correct phenotypic ratio would be 4:4:4:4, matching option F. But the wording in the options uses terms like \"checkered\" and \"plain,\" which might imply that the checkered pattern is separate from the coloration. \n\nIn any case, based on the given data and calculations, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to option F. However, the options provided do not exactly state this. Option F says \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which would indeed sum to 16 birds, with each category having 4. But this assumes that all birds have both traits, which is not the case because the checkered pattern is recessive. Therefore, the correct answer, considering the options, would be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If only one gene is dominant, it'll have one trait. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. Both recessive (c and b) \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor Pigment red and Brown (C and B):\n\nP(C) = 1 (since C is always dominant in this context)\nP(B) = 1 (since B is always dominant)\nSo P(Pigment red and Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, that seems off because the options don't include 100%. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the question. Oh! Wait, the problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" So the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, while the pigment color is controlled by the dominant C. Similarly, the plain color is controlled by recessive c, and brown color is dominant B. So the checkered pattern is c, and the coloration is governed by B and b. So the phenotypes are based on both genes. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of pigmentation and coloration. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So for each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n- Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both genes are dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (both genes are recessive)\n\nWhen Parent 1 (CC BB) mates with Parent 2 (cc bb), the F1 will be CcBb (as established earlier).\n\nThen, F1 selfs to get F2. The F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nEach of these occurs with certain probabilities. For example, the probability of CC is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4, similarly for cc, and Cc and cb each have 1/4. But since the genes are independent, we can calculate the phenotypic ratios directly without looking at the actual Punnett squares for each gene.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios for each gene are:\n\nGene C (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n- Pigment red : Plain = 1:0\n\nGene B (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n- Brown : Checkered = 1:0\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:0 for pigment and 1:0 for coloration, leading to 1:0:0:0, which isn't possible because all phenotypes must exist. Instead, we consider that each bird can express either pigment or coloration, but not both at the same time. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. Each bird has two traits: pigment color and coloration. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. In this case, since both traits are expressed unless one is recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, the F2 will have C and B always dominant, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so F1 is CcBb, and F2 will be the result of F1 selfing. Let me recalculate the probabilities properly.\n\nFor Gene C (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive), since the parents are CC and cc, the F1 will be Cc, and F2 will have probabilities:\n\nP(C) = 1 (because any C gives pigment red)\nP(c) = 0 (because any c gives plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B (p=1 for dominant, q=0 for recessive):\n\nP(B) = 1 (any B gives brown)\nP(b) = 0 (any b gives checkered)\n\nTherefore, the only phenotype that exists is Pigment red and Brown, because both genes are dominant in all F2 individuals. Thus, all F2 birds will have both traits expressed, resulting in a 1:0:0:0 phenotypic ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option E states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our conclusion. Option A is different. Option D also doesn't match. Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which still doesn't fit. Option G mentions checkered red 12, which is way too high. Option J says checkered red 2, which is unlikely given the parents' dominant traits.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, it'll have the other trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, it'll have the other trait. So the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, Brown\n4. Both genes recessive: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each of these phenotypes can be calculated. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus: Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1, B (dominant, brown) = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1: probability 1*1=1\n\nWait, that seems off. Because if both genes are dominant, then the bird will definitely have both traits. But looking back, the problem states that checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c. So, the presence of c makes the bird plain. Similarly, for the B gene, presence of B makes it brown, and b makes it checkered. So, the four possible phenotypes are indeed:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype 1: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (all red and brown)\nPhenotype 2: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 (can't happen)\nPhenotype 3: P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 (can't happen)\nPhenotype 4: P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 (can't happen)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. This approach must be flawed. Instead, let's consider the actual genotypes leading to each phenotype. The four phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotype combinations:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c c Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c c bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes, which then determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, let's count how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the cross of F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). Using a Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB and cb (assuming independent assortment). So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- (CB x CB) = CC BB\n- (CB x cb) = Cc BB\n- (cb x CB) = Cc BB\n- (cb x cb) = cc bb\n\nBut wait, considering the correct combinations, each parent can produce CB and cb gametes. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB (50%)\n- From cb x CB: Cc BB (another 25%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's map these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant)\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant)\n3. cc bb: Plain (c recessive), Checkered (b recessive)\n4. c c BB: Checkered (b recessive), Brown (B dominant)\n5. cc BB: Checkered (b recessive), Brown (B dominant)\n6. cc bb: Plain (c recessive), Checkered (b recessive)\n\nWait, but this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use the Punnett square directly to determine the phenotypes. Alternatively, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that the F1 is CcBb, and selfing, the phenotypic ratios can be determined without constructing a full Punnett square. Let me try that.\n\nEach gene (C and B) is segregating independently. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- C (red) is dominant over c (plain)\n- So, the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since any C results in red)\n- The probability of being plain (c) is 0 (since c is recessive and cannot appear in the phenotype unless it's expressed, but in reality, an individual with c cannot express any trait except the recessive ones, but in this case, since both C and B are dominant, the only recessive phenotype is plain-brown.)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B/b):\n\n- B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered)\n- Any B results in brown\n- Any b results in checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios are the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate the phenotypic ratios for each combination:\n\n1. Both traits dominant: Pigment red and brown\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nThis would mean all individuals have both traits, which seems odd because typically, each trait is expressed separately. However, in this context, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotype would be red and brown.\n\n2. Pigment red, checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\nThis means no individuals have pigment red and checkered.\n\n3. Plain, brown (c recessive, B dominant)\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\nAgain, no individuals have plain and brown.\n\n4. Plain, checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\nNo individuals have plain and checkered.\n\nWait, this can't be right because the sum of probabilities exceeds 1. Clearly, my approach is wrong. Instead, I should list all possible phenotypic categories and their corresponding probabilities. There are four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, this still sums up to 1, but clearly, the probabilities are zero for most cases, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm misapplying the principles. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the interaction between the two genes affects the overall phenotype. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Only C dominant, B recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Only B recessive, B dominant? Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive, the bird is plain, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if B is dominant, it's brown, regardless of c.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- If C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- If C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- If both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each bird inherits one allele from each parent, and the parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes with a 50% chance of CB, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Here, each parent is homozygous for both genes, so each gamete will carry one allele for each gene. Thus, the F1 will be CcBb, and the gametes will be CB and cb (since both parents can only give CB or cb). \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%) twice (from CB x CB)\n- CcBb (25%) twice (from CB x cb)\n- c c Bb (25%) twice (from cb x CB)\n- c c bb (25%) twice (from cb x cb)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. Cc BB (50%)\n3. cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n3. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n4. c c BB: Checkered, Brown\n5. cc BB: Checkered, Brown\n6. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach isn't helping. Instead, let's focus on the phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: All individuals with at least one dominant allele in both genes.\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, this simplifies to all individuals who have pigment red (C) and brown (B). But in reality, if both traits are dominant, the bird will have both traits. However, in our case, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotype is determined by both. So, the probability of having pigment red and brown is the same as the probability that both C and B are present, which is always true for the F1 (CcBb) since they have at least one dominant allele for both genes. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits, making them Pigment red and brown. But this contradicts earlier calculations because if both traits are always present, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis confusion arises because I'm mixing genotype and phenotype. The correct approach is to consider the phenotypic expressions based on the genotypes. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from CcBb are CB and cb.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          C | c\n        ----------------\n        B       | CB  | cb\n        B       | Cc  | cc\n        b       | cB  | cc\n        b       | cb  | bb\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb: Cc BB (50%)\n- cb x CB: Cc BB (another 25%)\n- cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc BB: Same as above\n4. cc bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach counts the same phenotype multiple times. To avoid duplication, I should group similar genotypes by phenotype.\n\nLooking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB and Cc BB both lead to Pigment red and Brown.\n- cc bb leads to Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 75% (25% + 25% + 25%)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 3:1 ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6 Phenotypes, unlikely\nB. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 same as A\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nD. 2:6:3:9 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Four phenotypes\nG. 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes\n\nHmm, all the options except G and H involve three phenotypes, while G and H involve three phenotypes as well. Option C involves three phenotypes (6:3:3:1), D is 2:6:3:9, E is 3:9:1:3, F is 4:4:4:4, G is 12:2:2:2, H is 5:3:2:6, I is 7:5:1:3, J is 2:6:3:1.\n\nFrom my previous analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (75%)\n2. Plain and Checkered (25%)\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"phenotypes\" rather than \"genotypes.\" So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nBased on the F2 generation, according to the Punnett square, 75% of the F2 will be Pigment red and Brown (because both C and B are dominant), and 25% will be Plain and Checkered (both c and b are recessive).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1 (or simplified to 3:1 for two pairs), but since there are four phenotypes, each with different ratios, the exact ratio would be 75% : 25%, which is 3:1, but spread across four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which includes four phenotypes. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also includes four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 75% (all these genotypes)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (only cc bb)\n\nSo, phenotypically, it's two categories: Pigment red and Brown (75%) and Plain and Checkered (25%).\n\nHowever, the options don't have a 3:1 ratio split into four phenotypes. Instead, they seem to represent the distribution of the four possible phenotypes. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Three phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, it'll have the other trait. So the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, Brown\n4. Both genes recessive: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each of these phenotypes can be calculated. Since each gene is inherited independently, the probability for each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus: Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1, B (dominant, brown) = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1: probability 1*1=1\n\nWait, that seems off. Because if both genes are dominant, then the bird will definitely have both traits. But looking back, the problem states that checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c. So, the presence of c makes the bird plain. Similarly, for the B gene, presence of B makes it brown, and b makes it checkered. So, the four possible phenotypes are indeed:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain, Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nPhenotype 1: P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (all red and brown)\nPhenotype 2: P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0 (can't happen)\nPhenotype 3: P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0 (can't happen)\nPhenotype 4: P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0 (can't happen)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. This approach must be flawed. Instead, let's consider the actual genotypes leading to each phenotype. The four phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotype combinations:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c c Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c c bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes, which then determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, let's count how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the cross of F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). Using a Punnett square, the possible gametes are CB and cb (assuming independent assortment). So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- (CB x CB) = CC BB\n- (CB x cb) = Cc BB\n- (cb x CB) = Cc BB\n- (cb x cb) = cc bb\n\nBut wait, considering the correct combinations, each parent can produce CB and cb gametes. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB (50%)\n- From cb x CB: Cc BB (another 25%)\n- From cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's map these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant)\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red (C dominant), Brown (B dominant)\n3. cc bb: Plain (c recessive), Checkered (b recessive)\n4. c c BB: Checkered (b recessive), Brown (B dominant)\n5. cc BB: Checkered (b recessive), Brown (B dominant)\n6. cc bb: Plain (c recessive), Checkered (b recessive)\n\nWait, but this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use the Punnett square directly to determine the phenotypes. Alternatively, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that the F1 is CcBb, and selfing, the phenotypic ratios can be determined without constructing a full Punnett square. Let me try that.\n\nEach gene (C and B) is segregating independently. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (C/B):\n\n- C (red) is dominant over c (plain)\n- So, the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since any C results in red)\n- The probability of being plain (c) is 0 (since c is recessive and cannot appear in the phenotype unless it's expressed, but in reality, an individual with c cannot express any trait except the recessive ones, but in this case, since both C and B are dominant, the only recessive phenotype is plain-brown.)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B/b):\n\n- B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered)\n- Any B results in brown\n- Any b results in checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios are the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate the phenotypic ratios for each combination:\n\n1. Both traits dominant: Pigment red and brown\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\nThis would mean all individuals have both traits, which seems odd because typically, each trait is expressed separately. However, in this context, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotype would be red and brown.\n\n2. Pigment red, checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\nThis means no individuals have pigment red and checkered.\n\n3. Plain, brown (c recessive, B dominant)\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\nAgain, no individuals have plain and brown.\n\n4. Plain, checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\nNo individuals have plain and checkered.\n\nWait, this can't be right because the sum of probabilities exceeds 1. Clearly, my approach is wrong. Instead, I should list all possible phenotypic categories and their corresponding probabilities. There are four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Probability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0 = 0\n3. Plain and brown: Probability = P(c) * P(B) = 0 * 1 = 0\n4. Plain and checkered: Probability = P(c) * P(b) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, this still sums up to 1, but clearly, the probabilities are zero for most cases, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm misapplying the principles. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype, but the interaction between the two genes affects the overall phenotype. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Only C dominant, B recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Only B recessive, B dominant? Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive, the bird is plain, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, if B is dominant, it's brown, regardless of c.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's clarify:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- If C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- If C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- If both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each bird inherits one allele from each parent, and the parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes with a 50% chance of CB, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Here, each parent is homozygous for both genes, so each gamete will carry one allele for each gene. Thus, the F1 will be CcBb, and the gametes will be CB and cb (since both parents can only give CB or cb). \n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%) twice (from CB x CB)\n- CcBb (25%) twice (from CB x cb)\n- c c Bb (25%) twice (from cb x CB)\n- c c bb (25%) twice (from cb x cb)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. Cc BB (50%)\n3. cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red, Brown\n3. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n4. c c BB: Checkered, Brown\n5. cc BB: Checkered, Brown\n6. cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach isn't helping. Instead, let's focus on the phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: All individuals with at least one dominant allele in both genes.\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, this simplifies to all individuals who have pigment red (C) and brown (B). But in reality, if both traits are dominant, the bird will have both traits. However, in our case, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotype is determined by both. So, the probability of having pigment red and brown is the same as the probability that both C and B are present, which is always true for the F1 (CcBb) since they have at least one dominant allele for both genes. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits, making them Pigment red and brown. But this contradicts earlier calculations because if both traits are always present, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis confusion arises because I'm mixing genotype and phenotype. The correct approach is to consider the phenotypic expressions based on the genotypes. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from CcBb are CB and cb.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          C | c\n        ----------------\n        B       | CB  | cb\n        B       | Cc  | cc\n        b       | cB  | cc\n        b       | cb  | bb\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb: Cc BB (50%)\n- cb x CB: Cc BB (another 25%)\n- cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc BB: Same as above\n4. cc bb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach counts the same phenotype multiple times. To avoid duplication, I should group similar genotypes by phenotype.\n\nLooking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB and Cc BB both lead to Pigment red and Brown.\n- cc bb leads to Plain and Checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 75% (25% + 25% + 25%)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (cc bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 3:1 ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6 Phenotypes, unlikely\nB. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 same as A\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nD. 2:6:3:9 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Four phenotypes\nG. 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Three phenotypes\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes\n\nHmm, all the options except G and H involve three phenotypes, while G and H involve three phenotypes as well. Option C involves three phenotypes (6:3:3:1), D is 2:6:3:9, E is 3:9:1:3, F is 4:4:4:4, G is 12:2:2:2, H is 5:3:2:6, I is 7:5:1:3, J is 2:6:3:1.\n\nFrom my previous analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (75%)\n2. Plain and Checkered (25%)\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"phenotypes\" rather than \"genotypes.\" So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nBased on the F2 generation, according to the Punnett square, 75% of the F2 will be Pigment red and Brown (because both C and B are dominant), and 25% will be Plain and Checkered (both c and b are recessive).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:3:1 (or simplified to 3:1 for two pairs), but since there are four phenotypes, each with different ratios, the exact ratio would be 75% : 25%, which is 3:1, but spread across four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which includes four phenotypes. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also includes four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 75% (all these genotypes)\n- Plain and Checkered: 25% (only cc bb)\n\nSo, phenotypically, it's two categories: Pigment red and Brown (75%) and Plain and Checkered (25%).\n\nHowever, the options don't have a 3:1 ratio split into four phenotypes. Instead, they seem to represent the distribution of the four possible phenotypes. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Three phenotypes, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Three phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh! The problem specifies that the F2 generation refers to the cross of a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Earlier, I considered the F1 as CcBb, but now I realize that the question is about the F2 generation resulting from crossing these two birds. So, the F1 would be their offspring, but the question asks about the F2 generation, which comes from crossing the F1 with itself or with another bird?\n\nWait, no\u2014the question says \"the F2 generation,\" which likely comes from a dihybrid cross between the two parents: one homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and one plain brown (cc bb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself (F1 x F1). Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. When you cross F1 (CcBb) with F1 again, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nAnd the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown (for CC BB",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, let me clarify: The presence of C (dominant) results in red pigment, and presence of B (dominant) results in brown color.",
    "rollout": " But wait, let me clarify: The presence of C (dominant) results in red pigment, and presence of B (dominant) results in brown color. So regardless of what the other allele is, if either gene is dominant, the corresponding trait is expressed. So every bird in this cross will have both traits: pigment red and brown. Because both parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring will inherit both dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, all birds will have both traits, leading to all phenotypes being the same: red and brown. But that seems unlikely, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"the checkered pattern\" refers to the bird's appearance, which is controlled by the C gene (C is dominant, c is recessive). So the presence of C (dominant) results in checkered (recessive) or plain (dominant)? Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: controlled by C (dominant, since C is dominant over c)\n- Plain color: controlled by c\nSo if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it'll have a checkered pattern. Otherwise, it'll be plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n- Brown (dominant, B)\n- Checkered (recessive, b)\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n- Red color: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Brown color: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant alleles for either gene will determine the phenotype.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the F2 generation. Since each parent is CC BB and cc bb, and they are crossed to produce F1 (CcBb), then F1 selfs to produce F2. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have four phenotypic classes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic expressions: dominant C (checkered?), no\u2014that's confusing. Wait, let me get this straight. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), so any C allele makes the bird checkered, and any c makes it plain. Similarly, brown is dominant (B) and checkered (b).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations where both genes are considered. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the segregation of each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant, checkered) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for the C gene, it'll be checkered. But in reality, if both alleles are dominant, it's still checkered. So, in this case, the C gene is always dominant in the offspring because both parents are homozygous for C. Therefore, all F2 birds will have the checkered pattern unless they also have a recessive allele for B. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has a dominant C allele, it's checkered, regardless of B. Only if the bird has a recessive C allele does it become plain. But in this cross, since both parents are homozygous for C (CC), all offspring will have at least one dominant C allele, making them checkered. So the C locus doesn't affect the phenotype beyond being checkered. Therefore, the phenotype for the C gene is fixed as checkered, except when combined with the B gene.\n\nThus, the actual variation comes from the B gene. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered and Brown (B dominant, C dominant)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C recessive, B dominant)\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nSince the C locus is always dominant, all birds will be checkered. So Phenotype 1 and 2 are distinct based on the B gene. Similarly, Phenotype 3 and 4 are distinct based on B. \n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated based on the B gene:\n\n- For B:\n  - Probability of B dominant (Brown): 1 (since B is dominant)\n  - Probability of B recessive (Checkered): 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. In reality, if a bird has a dominant B allele, it will have brown color, regardless of C. Since all F2 birds have at least one dominant C allele (because both parents are CC), the C gene doesn't affect the phenotype beyond being checkered. Therefore, all birds in the F2 generation will be checkered, and their phenotype will depend solely on the B gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined entirely by the B gene:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are Brown and Checkered. Now, we need to calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since the C gene is always dominant, the phenotypic ratio simplifies. All birds will be checkered, and their phenotype will depend on the B gene. The B gene has two alleles, and the presence of a dominant B allele results in brown, while the recessive B allele results in checkered.\n\nWhen crossing two heterozygotes (CcBb x CcBb), the F2 generation will have a 25% chance of each possible genotype for the B gene: BB, Bb, bB, and bb. But since B is dominant, all BB and Bb individuals will have brown color, while bb will have checkered.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Brown: BB and Bb \u2192 3/4 of the F2\n- Checkered: bb \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n\nBut wait, that's without considering the C gene, which isn't affecting the phenotype further. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:1, with 3 parts Brown and 1 part Checkered.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my earlier conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the C gene is about pigmentation, not about color. The checkered pattern is due to the C gene, and the color is determined by B. So, in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), and the color by B. The problem didn't mention anything about red color, so perhaps red color is another aspect. Wait, no\u2014the problem starts by saying \"The checkered pattern... is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" So, perhaps the presence of dominant C results in checkered, and the color could be influenced by another factor. Hmm, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, rereading the problem:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nAh! So, now I realize that the problem includes multiple traits. Red is determined by B, and brown by b. So, the color is determined by the B gene, and the pattern by the C gene. Also, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which affects the overall appearance, possibly including color.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the starting point. Let me read it again.\n\nThe adi hybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, each parent is a dihybrid cross itself, resulting in F1 as CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 is selfed to produce F2. The F2 will have a certain number of phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the colors will depend on the B gene, and the patterns on the feathers (checkered vs plain) may depend on both C and B. But according to the problem, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which affects the overall color. So, if C is dominant, the bird appears checkered, which might include brown or plain depending on B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a specific feature that combines with the color. But that complicates things. Perhaps the problem is simply asking about the color expression based on the B gene, ignoring the checkered pattern beyond being a feature.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive, C dominant)\n\nBecause the C gene is dominant in all offspring (as both parents are homozygous for C). Therefore, all F2 birds will have a checkered pattern, and their color will be determined by B. So, 100% checkered, with the color being brown (B dominant) or checkered (B recessive). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% brown to 100% checkered, but that's not among the options. Instead, the options involve different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom my previous analysis, I thought the ratio was 3:1 for checkered (brown:checkered), but none of the options match that exactly. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which adds up to 16. Let's see: 8+4+0+4=16. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers both genes separately, leading to 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since the C gene is always dominant, the checkered pattern overrides any color issues. So perhaps the color determination is separate.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Each bird is determined by two genes: C (for pattern) and B (for color). The C gene is dominant (C), so the pattern is checkered regardless of B. The color is determined by B: dominant (B) is brown, recessive (b) is checkered.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, all birds will have the checkered pattern (since C is dominant) and their color will depend on B. So, half of the F2 will be brown, and half will be checkered. Wait, but that can't be, because in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is usually 9:3:3:1, but when one gene is always dominant, it changes the ratio.\n\nWait, actually, when the C gene is always dominant, the effect of the B gene determines the color, and the pattern is always checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is based solely on the B gene, giving a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to reflect a 3:1 ratio. Instead, the options are more complex. Perhaps the problem includes another factor related to the pigmentation, such as whether the color is red or brown. Wait, the problem mentions red color, which is determined by B. So, if B is dominant, the bird is brown; if recessive, it's checkered.\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the problem. Let me re-examine it:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant C results in checkered pattern. The color is determined by B: dominant B is brown, recessive B is checkered. The checkered pattern is a feature that may influence the color, but perhaps the color is determined by both the gene and the pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the color is determined by B, but the pattern is checkedered only when B is present. No, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is determined by B. So, the color is determined by B, and the checkered pattern is an additional feature that may or may not be present.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it out to be. Let me consider the following:\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits: checkered pattern (C) and color (B). The checkered pattern is a feature that is always present if the bird has at least one dominant C allele. The color is determined by B: dominant B is brown, recessive B is checkered.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive, C dominant)\n\nBut since the C gene is dominant in all F2 offspring (because both parents are CC), all birds will have the checkered pattern, and their color will be determined by B. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is based purely on the B gene, leading to a 3:1 ratio: 3 parts brown, 1 part checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match this. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which adds up to 16, but that would imply a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both genes together, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but with the knowledge that the C gene is dominant, thus altering the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the checkered pattern is only seen when B is present. No, the problem states that checkered is controlled by C, and color by B, without mentioning that checkeredness is dependent on color. So, the presence of dominant C leads to checkered, which may include both brown and plain colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the checkered pattern is only visible when the bird is brown. No, the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color by B.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). Each parent contributes CcBb, so the F1 can produce CcBb gametes equally. Crossing F1 x F1:\n\n- The possible gametes are CcBb.\n- The F2 genotype combinations are:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci assort independently, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypic expression:\n\n- For the C locus: dominant C leads to checkered pattern. recessive c leads to plain.\n- For the B locus: dominant B leads to brown color. recessive b leads to checkered.\n\nSince C is always dominant, all F2 birds will have the checkered pattern (because they have at least one dominant C allele). Their color is determined by B: if B is dominant (B), they are brown; if b (recessive), they are checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined solely by the B locus, leading to a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1, but none of the options match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis seems off because the problem mentions red color, which is determined by B. If B is dominant, the bird is brown; else, checkered. So, checkered brown would be less frequent than checkered red. But in this context, red might refer to something else, perhaps the bird's fur color. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to pigmentation beyond just color and pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But wait, let me clarify: The presence of C (dominant) results in red pigment, and presence of B (dominant) results in brown color. So regardless of what the other allele is, if either gene is dominant, the corresponding trait is expressed. So every bird in this cross will have both traits: pigment red and brown. Because both parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring will inherit both dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, all birds will have both traits, leading to all phenotypes being the same: red and brown. But that seems unlikely, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"the checkered pattern\" refers to the bird's appearance, which is controlled by the C gene (C is dominant, c is recessive). So the presence of C (dominant) results in checkered (recessive) or plain (dominant)? Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: controlled by C (dominant, since C is dominant over c)\n- Plain color: controlled by c\nSo if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it'll have a checkered pattern. Otherwise, it'll be plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n- Brown (dominant, B)\n- Checkered (recessive, b)\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n- Red color: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Brown color: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant alleles for either gene will determine the phenotype.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the F2 generation. Since each parent is CC BB and cc bb, and they are crossed to produce F1 (CcBb), then F1 selfs to produce F2. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have four phenotypic classes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic expressions: dominant C (checkered?), no\u2014that's confusing. Wait, let me get this straight. The problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), so any C allele makes the bird checkered, and any c makes it plain. Similarly, brown is dominant (B) and checkered (b).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations where both genes are considered. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Checkered and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the segregation of each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (dominant, checkered) = 1\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for the C gene, it'll be checkered. But in reality, if both alleles are dominant, it's still checkered. So, in this case, the C gene is always dominant in the offspring because both parents are homozygous for C. Therefore, all F2 birds will have the checkered pattern unless they also have a recessive allele for B. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has a dominant C allele, it's checkered, regardless of B. Only if the bird has a recessive C allele does it become plain. But in this cross, since both parents are homozygous for C (CC), all offspring will have at least one dominant C allele, making them checkered. So the C locus doesn't affect the phenotype beyond being checkered. Therefore, the phenotype for the C gene is fixed as checkered, except when combined with the B gene.\n\nThus, the actual variation comes from the B gene. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered and Brown (B dominant, C dominant)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C recessive, B dominant)\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n\nSince the C locus is always dominant, all birds will be checkered. So Phenotype 1 and 2 are distinct based on the B gene. Similarly, Phenotype 3 and 4 are distinct based on B. \n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated based on the B gene:\n\n- For B:\n  - Probability of B dominant (Brown): 1 (since B is dominant)\n  - Probability of B recessive (Checkered): 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. In reality, if a bird has a dominant B allele, it will have brown color, regardless of C. Since all F2 birds have at least one dominant C allele (because both parents are CC), the C gene doesn't affect the phenotype beyond being checkered. Therefore, all birds in the F2 generation will be checkered, and their phenotype will depend solely on the B gene.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined entirely by the B gene:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are Brown and Checkered. Now, we need to calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since the C gene is always dominant, the phenotypic ratio simplifies. All birds will be checkered, and their phenotype will depend on the B gene. The B gene has two alleles, and the presence of a dominant B allele results in brown, while the recessive B allele results in checkered.\n\nWhen crossing two heterozygotes (CcBb x CcBb), the F2 generation will have a 25% chance of each possible genotype for the B gene: BB, Bb, bB, and bb. But since B is dominant, all BB and Bb individuals will have brown color, while bb will have checkered.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Brown: BB and Bb \u2192 3/4 of the F2\n- Checkered: bb \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n\nBut wait, that's without considering the C gene, which isn't affecting the phenotype further. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:1, with 3 parts Brown and 1 part Checkered.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my earlier conclusion. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the C gene is about pigmentation, not about color. The checkered pattern is due to the C gene, and the color is determined by B. So, in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), and the color by B. The problem didn't mention anything about red color, so perhaps red color is another aspect. Wait, no\u2014the problem starts by saying \"The checkered pattern... is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" So, perhaps the presence of dominant C results in checkered, and the color could be influenced by another factor. Hmm, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, rereading the problem:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nAh! So, now I realize that the problem includes multiple traits. Red is determined by B, and brown by b. So, the color is determined by the B gene, and the pattern by the C gene. Also, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which affects the overall appearance, possibly including color.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the starting point. Let me read it again.\n\nThe adi hybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, each parent is a dihybrid cross itself, resulting in F1 as CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 is selfed to produce F2. The F2 will have a certain number of phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the colors will depend on the B gene, and the patterns on the feathers (checkered vs plain) may depend on both C and B. But according to the problem, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which affects the overall color. So, if C is dominant, the bird appears checkered, which might include brown or plain depending on B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is a specific feature that combines with the color. But that complicates things. Perhaps the problem is simply asking about the color expression based on the B gene, ignoring the checkered pattern beyond being a feature.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive, C dominant)\n\nBecause the C gene is dominant in all offspring (as both parents are homozygous for C). Therefore, all F2 birds will have a checkered pattern, and their color will be determined by B. So, 100% checkered, with the color being brown (B dominant) or checkered (B recessive). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% brown to 100% checkered, but that's not among the options. Instead, the options involve different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom my previous analysis, I thought the ratio was 3:1 for checkered (brown:checkered), but none of the options match that exactly. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which adds up to 16. Let's see: 8+4+0+4=16. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers both genes separately, leading to 9:3:3:1 ratio. But since the C gene is always dominant, the checkered pattern overrides any color issues. So perhaps the color determination is separate.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Each bird is determined by two genes: C (for pattern) and B (for color). The C gene is dominant (C), so the pattern is checkered regardless of B. The color is determined by B: dominant (B) is brown, recessive (b) is checkered.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, all birds will have the checkered pattern (since C is dominant) and their color will depend on B. So, half of the F2 will be brown, and half will be checkered. Wait, but that can't be, because in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is usually 9:3:3:1, but when one gene is always dominant, it changes the ratio.\n\nWait, actually, when the C gene is always dominant, the effect of the B gene determines the color, and the pattern is always checkered. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is based solely on the B gene, giving a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to reflect a 3:1 ratio. Instead, the options are more complex. Perhaps the problem includes another factor related to the pigmentation, such as whether the color is red or brown. Wait, the problem mentions red color, which is determined by B. So, if B is dominant, the bird is brown; if recessive, it's checkered.\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the problem. Let me re-examine it:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant C results in checkered pattern. The color is determined by B: dominant B is brown, recessive B is checkered. The checkered pattern is a feature that may influence the color, but perhaps the color is determined by both the gene and the pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the color is determined by B, but the pattern is checkedered only when B is present. No, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is determined by B. So, the color is determined by B, and the checkered pattern is an additional feature that may or may not be present.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it out to be. Let me consider the following:\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits: checkered pattern (C) and color (B). The checkered pattern is a feature that is always present if the bird has at least one dominant C allele. The color is determined by B: dominant B is brown, recessive B is checkered.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (B recessive, C dominant)\n\nBut since the C gene is dominant in all F2 offspring (because both parents are CC), all birds will have the checkered pattern, and their color will be determined by B. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is based purely on the B gene, leading to a 3:1 ratio: 3 parts brown, 1 part checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match this. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which adds up to 16, but that would imply a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both genes together, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but with the knowledge that the C gene is dominant, thus altering the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the checkered pattern is only seen when B is present. No, the problem states that checkered is controlled by C, and color by B, without mentioning that checkeredness is dependent on color. So, the presence of dominant C leads to checkered, which may include both brown and plain colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the checkered pattern is only visible when the bird is brown. No, the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color by B.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). Each parent contributes CcBb, so the F1 can produce CcBb gametes equally. Crossing F1 x F1:\n\n- The possible gametes are CcBb.\n- The F2 genotype combinations are:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the loci assort independently, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypic expression:\n\n- For the C locus: dominant C leads to checkered pattern. recessive c leads to plain.\n- For the B locus: dominant B leads to brown color. recessive b leads to checkered.\n\nSince C is always dominant, all F2 birds will have the checkered pattern (because they have at least one dominant C allele). Their color is determined by B: if B is dominant (B), they are brown; if b (recessive), they are checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined solely by the B locus, leading to a 3:1 ratio: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1, but none of the options match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis seems off because the problem mentions red color, which is determined by B. If B is dominant, the bird is brown; else, checkered. So, checkered brown would be less frequent than checkered red. But in this context, red might refer to something else, perhaps the bird's fur color. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to pigmentation beyond just color and pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), and the color is controlled by B. The plain color is determined by recessive c, and red by dominant B. So, in this case, the bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Checkered (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, the phenotypes are based on both genes.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown checkered\n\nNow, given the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's determine how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, the F1 will be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB or cb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of inheriting the dominant allele (for pigment) is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4. Similarly for color. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red but no brown (i.e., B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having no pigment red (i.e., c) is (1/4)*something\u2014but wait, since pigment is determined by C, if the bird has c, it won't have pigment red. So regardless of B, if c is present, pigment is plain. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: ?\n\nWait, let's clarify. Pigment red requires at least one C. Brown requires at least one B. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so 16/16=1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't match our calculation. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That also doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also no. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, none seem to match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, but the options are giving specific counts. Maybe it's better to consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the genotypes. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach F2 bird is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). The F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CcBb:\n   - Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red\n   - Color: B is dominant \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red and brown (but since both traits are expressed, it's simply \"Checkered red\" because brown is a distinct trait from plain. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, it's a combination of both, but in terms of phenotype classification, it's one category: \"Checkered red-brown.\" But the options don't mention that. Instead, they list separate categories like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, perhaps each bird is classified based on whether they have the dominant or recessive for each trait. So:\n\n   - Pigment red: presence of C\n   - Pigment plain: absence of C (c)\n   - Color brown: presence of B\n   - Color plain: absence of B (b)\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and plain: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain and plain: C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Phenotype A\n- Ccbb: Phenotype B\n- ccBB: Phenotype C\n- ccbb: Phenotype D\n\nSince each genotype has a 25% chance, the F2 generation will have:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, the probabilities were 9/16 for A, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 1/16 for D. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Oh, I must have made a mistake. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so the probabilities should add up to 16 parts, with 9 for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, and 1 for D. So the actual F2 distribution would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the options don't reflect that exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16, which fits 9:3:3:1 scaled appropriately. If 16 parts correspond to 16 birds, then 9 parts would be 9 birds, 3 parts 3 birds, etc. But the options don't use fractions; instead, they provide whole numbers. So perhaps the question is asking for the counts without scaling to 16. Let me recast the probabilities into counts.\n\nIf each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and each genotype corresponds to one of the four phenotypes, then in a group of, say, 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exact distribution. However, looking at the options, option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 12 birds, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Option E is 3,9,1,3 which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 but shows different ratios. Option G is 12,2,2,0 which sums to 16 but shows a different distribution. Option F is 4,4,4,4 which would imply all phenotypes equally likely, but according to our calculations, it's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe it's not asking for the genetic ratios but rather the phenotypic ratios based on the observed counts. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the counts after applying dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes based on dominance. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment: C (dominant) makes the bird red; c makes it plain.\n- Color: B (dominant) makes the bird brown; b makes it plain.\n\nSo for a bird to have red pigment and brown color, it needs both C and B. To have red pigment but plain color, it needs C but not B. To have plain pigment but brown color, it needs B but not C. To have both plain pigment and plain color, it needs neither C nor B.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red and brown (Class A)\n2. C and not B \u2192 Checkered red (Class B)\n3. Not C and B \u2192 Checkered brown (Class C)\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain red and plain brown (Class D)\n\nIn a sample of 16 birds (assuming 16), we'd expect:\n\n- Class A: 9 birds\n- Class B: 3 birds\n- Class C: 3 birds\n- Class D: 1 bird\n\nHowever, none of the answer options perfectly reflect this unless we scale differently. But looking at the options, option G states a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which is 16 birds, implying 12 have one phenotype, 2 have another, etc. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but has different distributions. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also sums to 16 but differs.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption about dominance. Let me double-check. The problem states:\n\n- Red pigment: C is dominant\n- Brown color: B is dominant\n\nSo a bird that is red and brown must have both dominant alleles for pigment and color. A bird that is red but plain must have C (pigment) but not B (color). A bird that is plain but brown must have B (color) but not C (pigment). A bird that is plain in both must have neither.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this directly except possibly option J, which is 2,6,3,1, but that sums to 12, which is less than 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with certain traits, not accounting for all possible phenotypes. Maybe the options are presenting the counts under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles, leading to four phenotypes, each appearing once in a group of 16. But that still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question intended to ask about the F2 phenotypic ratio in terms of dominance, i.e., which birds are expressing which traits. In that case, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. However, looking at the options again, option G mentions a ratio where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That sums to 16 and matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled by dividing each part by something. Wait, 9:3:3:1 divided by something equals 12:2:2:0. But 9/12=3/4, 3/2=1.5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the question is not asking for the genetic ratio but the phenotypic ratio based on the actual expression of traits. For example, if the F2 generation consists of 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, and 25% plain brown, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here due to dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant traits, ignoring recessives, but that's not standard practice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, not the phenotypic expressions. For instance, a bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment and color would be considered as having red pigment and brown color, while those with no dominant alleles would have plain colors. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, as before.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them perfectly match this except option J, which is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, which is incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but has different ratios. Option D is 1,3,9,3, same issue. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is equal distribution, which we know isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is mistaken, and the intended answer is option G, despite the discrepancy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I was supposed to create a Punnett square showing the F\u2081 and F\u2082 generations, including phenotypic ratios. But the options given are about F\u2082 phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, in my earlier analysis, the F\u2082 genotypes would lead to four phenotypes with a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include that. However, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 and represents a different distribution. Perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each phenotype in a hypothetical group of 16, but distributed as 12,2,2,0, indicating that most birds have checkered red, fewer have checkered brown, and very few have plain red or plain brown.\n\nThis could happen if the F\u2082 generation includes birds that are mostly checkered red, followed by checkered brown, and minimal cases of plain red or plain brown. But according to our calculations, the actual F\u2082 distribution should follow 9:3:3:1, not 12:2:2:0. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are incorrect, or I misapplied the principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant traits, not the recessive ones. For example, a bird is considered to have red pigment if it carries at least one C allele, and brown color if it carries at least one B allele. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color)\n- Checkered brown: At least one C and no B\n- Plain red: No C and at least one B\n- Plain brown: No C and no B\n\nWhich again leads to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. None of the options reflect this exactly, except option J, which sums to 12, but that's incorrect.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F\u2081 generation instead of F\u2082, but that wouldn't make much sense. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, and see which option aligns. Option G is the closest, but it's presented as 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to ask for the F\u2081 phenotypic ratio, which would be 3:1 (pigment red : plain), but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is flawed, but assuming I have to choose based on my earlier calculations, the correct F\u2082 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might have made an error in analyzing the question.\n\nWait, going back, the user's initial setup included a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They showed the expected gametes as (CB) (cb) (cB) (cb), and the resulting F\u2081 as CcBb, which would produce the F\u2082 genotypes. Then, the F\u2082 phenotypes would be based on the dominance rules. According to my earlier analysis, the F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but I'm not sure why that would be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each trait, not accounting for the entire population. For example, if there are 16 birds, the F\u2082 would have 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown, totaling 16. But the options don't reflect this. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the actual ratios. Therefore, I'm unsure. However, given the options, option G is the most plausible, though strictly speaking, it's incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F\u2081 phenotypic ratio, which would be 3:1 (red : plain), but that's not an option either.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the intended answer is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Despite the fact that the actual F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1, perhaps the question assumes a larger population or a different scenario, making option G the closest match.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown checkered\n\nNow, given the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's determine how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, the F1 will be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB or cb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of inheriting the dominant allele (for pigment) is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4. Similarly for color. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo, the probability of having both traits (pigment red and brown) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of having pigment red but no brown (i.e., B recessive) is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThe probability of having no pigment red (i.e., c) is (1/4)*something\u2014but wait, since pigment is determined by C, if the bird has c, it won't have pigment red. So regardless of B, if c is present, pigment is plain. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and brown: ?\n\nWait, let's clarify. Pigment red requires at least one C. Brown requires at least one B. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: c dominant, B recessive \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so 16/16=1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't match our calculation. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That also doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also no. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, none seem to match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, but the options are giving specific counts. Maybe it's better to consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the genotypes. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach F2 bird is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). The F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- ccBB (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CcBb:\n   - Pigment: C is dominant \u2192 red\n   - Color: B is dominant \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red and brown (but since both traits are expressed, it's simply \"Checkered red\" because brown is a distinct trait from plain. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, it's a combination of both, but in terms of phenotype classification, it's one category: \"Checkered red-brown.\" But the options don't mention that. Instead, they list separate categories like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, perhaps each bird is classified based on whether they have the dominant or recessive for each trait. So:\n\n   - Pigment red: presence of C\n   - Pigment plain: absence of C (c)\n   - Color brown: presence of B\n   - Color plain: absence of B (b)\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and plain: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain and plain: C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Phenotype A\n- Ccbb: Phenotype B\n- ccBB: Phenotype C\n- ccbb: Phenotype D\n\nSince each genotype has a 25% chance, the F2 generation will have:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, the probabilities were 9/16 for A, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 1/16 for D. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Oh, I must have made a mistake. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, so the probabilities should add up to 16 parts, with 9 for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, and 1 for D. So the actual F2 distribution would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the options don't reflect that exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16, which fits 9:3:3:1 scaled appropriately. If 16 parts correspond to 16 birds, then 9 parts would be 9 birds, 3 parts 3 birds, etc. But the options don't use fractions; instead, they provide whole numbers. So perhaps the question is asking for the counts without scaling to 16. Let me recast the probabilities into counts.\n\nIf each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, and each genotype corresponds to one of the four phenotypes, then in a group of, say, 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nBut none of the answer choices match this exact distribution. However, looking at the options, option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 12 birds, which doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Option E is 3,9,1,3 which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16 but shows different ratios. Option G is 12,2,2,0 which sums to 16 but shows a different distribution. Option F is 4,4,4,4 which would imply all phenotypes equally likely, but according to our calculations, it's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe it's not asking for the genetic ratios but rather the phenotypic ratios based on the observed counts. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the counts after applying dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes based on dominance. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment: C (dominant) makes the bird red; c makes it plain.\n- Color: B (dominant) makes the bird brown; b makes it plain.\n\nSo for a bird to have red pigment and brown color, it needs both C and B. To have red pigment but plain color, it needs C but not B. To have plain pigment but brown color, it needs B but not C. To have both plain pigment and plain color, it needs neither C nor B.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered red and brown (Class A)\n2. C and not B \u2192 Checkered red (Class B)\n3. Not C and B \u2192 Checkered brown (Class C)\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain red and plain brown (Class D)\n\nIn a sample of 16 birds (assuming 16), we'd expect:\n\n- Class A: 9 birds\n- Class B: 3 birds\n- Class C: 3 birds\n- Class D: 1 bird\n\nHowever, none of the answer options perfectly reflect this unless we scale differently. But looking at the options, option G states a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which is 16 birds, implying 12 have one phenotype, 2 have another, etc. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but has different distributions. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which also sums to 16 but differs.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption about dominance. Let me double-check. The problem states:\n\n- Red pigment: C is dominant\n- Brown color: B is dominant\n\nSo a bird that is red and brown must have both dominant alleles for pigment and color. A bird that is red but plain must have C (pigment) but not B (color). A bird that is plain but brown must have B (color) but not C (pigment). A bird that is plain in both must have neither.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this directly except possibly option J, which is 2,6,3,1, but that sums to 12, which is less than 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with certain traits, not accounting for all possible phenotypes. Maybe the options are presenting the counts under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of the dominant alleles, leading to four phenotypes, each appearing once in a group of 16. But that still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question intended to ask about the F2 phenotypic ratio in terms of dominance, i.e., which birds are expressing which traits. In that case, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. However, looking at the options again, option G mentions a ratio where checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That sums to 16 and matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled by dividing each part by something. Wait, 9:3:3:1 divided by something equals 12:2:2:0. But 9/12=3/4, 3/2=1.5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the question is not asking for the genetic ratio but the phenotypic ratio based on the actual expression of traits. For example, if the F2 generation consists of 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, and 25% plain brown, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here due to dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant traits, ignoring recessives, but that's not standard practice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles, not the phenotypic expressions. For instance, a bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment and color would be considered as having red pigment and brown color, while those with no dominant alleles would have plain colors. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, as before.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them perfectly match this except option J, which is 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, which is incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but has different ratios. Option D is 1,3,9,3, same issue. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is equal distribution, which we know isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is mistaken, and the intended answer is option G, despite the discrepancy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I was supposed to create a Punnett square showing the F\u2081 and F\u2082 generations, including phenotypic ratios. But the options given are about F\u2082 phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, in my earlier analysis, the F\u2082 genotypes would lead to four phenotypes with a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't include that. However, option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 and represents a different distribution. Perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each phenotype in a hypothetical group of 16, but distributed as 12,2,2,0, indicating that most birds have checkered red, fewer have checkered brown, and very few have plain red or plain brown.\n\nThis could happen if the F\u2082 generation includes birds that are mostly checkered red, followed by checkered brown, and minimal cases of plain red or plain brown. But according to our calculations, the actual F\u2082 distribution should follow 9:3:3:1, not 12:2:2:0. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are incorrect, or I misapplied the principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant traits, not the recessive ones. For example, a bird is considered to have red pigment if it carries at least one C allele, and brown color if it carries at least one B allele. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C (pigment) and at least one B (color)\n- Checkered brown: At least one C and no B\n- Plain red: No C and at least one B\n- Plain brown: No C and no B\n\nWhich again leads to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. None of the options reflect this exactly, except option J, which sums to 12, but that's incorrect.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F\u2081 generation instead of F\u2082, but that wouldn't make much sense. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, and see which option aligns. Option G is the closest, but it's presented as 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to ask for the F\u2081 phenotypic ratio, which would be 3:1 (pigment red : plain), but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is flawed, but assuming I have to choose based on my earlier calculations, the correct F\u2082 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might have made an error in analyzing the question.\n\nWait, going back, the user's initial setup included a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They showed the expected gametes as (CB) (cb) (cB) (cb), and the resulting F\u2081 as CcBb, which would produce the F\u2082 genotypes. Then, the F\u2082 phenotypes would be based on the dominance rules. According to my earlier analysis, the F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but I'm not sure why that would be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with each trait, not accounting for the entire population. For example, if there are 16 birds, the F\u2082 would have 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown, totaling 16. But the options don't reflect this. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the actual ratios. Therefore, I'm unsure. However, given the options, option G is the most plausible, though strictly speaking, it's incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the F\u2081 phenotypic ratio, which would be 3:1 (red : plain), but that's not an option either.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the intended answer is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Despite the fact that the actual F\u2082 ratio should be 9:3:3:1, perhaps the question assumes a larger population or a different scenario, making option G the closest match.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed. Wait, but in this case, both traits are expressed regardless because both genes are dominant. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, and the recessive allele c controls plain. Similarly, B controls color, and b controls checkered. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B will have brown. Therefore, the phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display both traits. If it has a recessive allele for one gene but dominant for the other, it'll display the dominant trait for that gene. Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly how dominance works. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype combines both traits. So, a bird could have pigment red (C) and brown (B), which would mean it has both dominant alleles for both genes, resulting in both traits being expressed. A bird could have pigment red (C) and checkered (b), meaning it has a dominant C but a recessive b for B. Another possibility is pigment plain (c) and brown (B), meaning it has a recessive c but dominant B. Finally, a bird with both recessives (c and b) would have plain (from c) and checkered (from b).\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. Since each parent is homozygous for their respective genes, the F1 generation (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will have specific genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as previously established. The F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. Now, each gene is segregating independently, so the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor the C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nFor the B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach with equal probabilities. Wait, but the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of these. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the number of each combination.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain brown\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, the segregation is 25%, so for two genes, there are 9 possible phenotypic combinations. However, due to the dominance relationship, some of these may combine into the same phenotype. Let me correct that.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. If it has a recessive allele for either gene, it won't express that trait. So, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant for both genes (C_B_): Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. Dominant for pigment, recessive for body (C_bb): Pigment red, Checkered brown\n3. Recessive for pigment, dominant for body (cc_B_): Plain, Brown brown\n4. Recessive for both (cc_bb): Plain, Plain brown\n\nThese four phenotypes account for all possible combinations where both traits are expressed if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. Now, let's determine the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene segregates independently, the probabilities can be multiplied:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_B_): (Probability of C_) * (Probability of B_)\n  - Probability of C_: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; summing CC and Cc gives 3/4)\n  - Probability of B_: 3/4\n  - So, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype 2 (C_bb): (Probability of C_) * (Probability of bb)\n  - Probability of C_: 3/4\n  - Probability of bb: 1/4 (only cc)\n  - So, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype 3 (cc_B_): (Probability of cc) * (Probability of B_)\n  - Probability of cc: 1/4\n  - Probability of B_: 3/4\n  - So, 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype 4 (cc_bb): (Probability of cc) * (Probability of bb)\n  - Probability of cc: 1/4\n  - Probability of bb: 1/4\n  - So, 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Phenotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't be expressed. Wait, but in this case, both traits are expressed regardless because both genes are dominant. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question states that the dominant allele C controls pigment color, and the recessive allele c controls plain. Similarly, B controls color, and b controls checkered. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B will have brown. Therefore, the phenotype of a bird is determined by both genes. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display both traits. If it has a recessive allele for one gene but dominant for the other, it'll display the dominant trait for that gene. Wait, no\u2014that's not exactly how dominance works. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype combines both traits. So, a bird could have pigment red (C) and brown (B), which would mean it has both dominant alleles for both genes, resulting in both traits being expressed. A bird could have pigment red (C) and checkered (b), meaning it has a dominant C but a recessive b for B. Another possibility is pigment plain (c) and brown (B), meaning it has a recessive c but dominant B. Finally, a bird with both recessives (c and b) would have plain (from c) and checkered (from b).\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype. Since each parent is homozygous for their respective genes, the F1 generation (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will have specific genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is from the cross of a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as previously established. The F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself. Now, each gene is segregating independently, so the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor the C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nFor the B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach with equal probabilities. Wait, but the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of these. So the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the number of each combination.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Plain brown\n\nWait, that seems too many. Actually, for each gene, the segregation is 25%, so for two genes, there are 9 possible phenotypic combinations. However, due to the dominance relationship, some of these may combine into the same phenotype. Let me correct that.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, for a bird to have both traits expressed, it must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. If it has a recessive allele for either gene, it won't express that trait. So, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both dominant for both genes (C_B_): Pigment red, Brown brown\n2. Dominant for pigment, recessive for body (C_bb): Pigment red, Checkered brown\n3. Recessive for pigment, dominant for body (cc_B_): Plain, Brown brown\n4. Recessive for both (cc_bb): Plain, Plain brown\n\nThese four phenotypes account for all possible combinations where both traits are expressed if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. Now, let's determine the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each gene segregates independently, the probabilities can be multiplied:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_B_): (Probability of C_) * (Probability of B_)\n  - Probability of C_: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; summing CC and Cc gives 3/4)\n  - Probability of B_: 3/4\n  - So, 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Phenotype 2 (C_bb): (Probability of C_) * (Probability of bb)\n  - Probability of C_: 3/4\n  - Probability of bb: 1/4 (only cc)\n  - So, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype 3 (cc_B_): (Probability of cc) * (Probability of B_)\n  - Probability of cc: 1/4\n  - Probability of B_: 3/4\n  - So, 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Phenotype 4 (cc_bb): (Probability of cc) * (Probability of bb)\n  - Probability of cc: 1/4\n  - Probability of bb: 1/4\n  - So, 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Phenotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. So let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird has two independent genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. To find the phenotypic ratio, we calculate the number of birds in each category.\n\nThe probability of being phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) is the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene. Since both genes are dominant, this would always occur unless the bird is missing a dominant allele, which isn't possible here because the parents' genotypes allow for all combinations. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Actually, for each gene, the probability of expressing a dominant trait is higher than the recessive one. But in reality, each bird either expresses both traits or none. Wait, but that's not possible because the genes determine the expression, and both can be dominant, leading to both traits expressed. So all birds will have either both traits or neither, depending on their genotype.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Both traits can coexist regardless of dominance. So each bird can have both traits, or one, or neither, depending on their alleles. But given the dominance hierarchy, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will display both. If a bird has one dominant allele for a trait and one recessive for the other, it will display that trait. If a bird has no dominant alleles for either trait, it won't display any.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypic ratios are based on how often each combination occurs. So for the C locus: presence (C) or absence (c); same for B. Each gene has three possibilities if dominance allowed, but in this case, since both traits require at least one dominant allele, the actual phenotypes are fourfold: RR (both dominant), Rr (only one dominant), rR (same as Rr), and rr (none).\n\nBut since both genes are under complete dominance (as indicated by the way the problem describes it, where \"dominant\" implies that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait), the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (Red and Brown)\n2. Only Pigment Red (no Brown)\n3. Only Pigment Checkered (no Red)\n4. Neither trait expressed (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each category:\n\nFor Pigment Red and Brown (RR):\nThis requires at least one R (C) and at least one B (B). From the parents' genotypes, Parent 1 is CC BB, so all their offspring must receive C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 1. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so all their offspring must receive c from Parent 2 and b from Parent 2. Therefore, all offspring from F1 \u00d7 F1 (which are the same as F2 here) must be CcBb. Therefore, all birds in F2 will have at least one C and at least one B, meaning all four phenotypic categories will occur. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 100%.\n\nBut that contradicts the answer choices, which suggest different ratios. Hmm. Maybe I've misunderstood something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so c is the recessive allele for checkered. The checkered pattern arises when both c and c alleles are present (i.e., cc). The checkered pattern is an epistatic effect, meaning the presence of a dominant allele for pigment (C) masks the checkered pattern if c is present. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So c is the only allele that results in checkered, while C is for pigment. So if a bird has at least one C, it will have red pigment. If it also has at least one c, then it will be checkered. Otherwise, if it has no C, it will have plain color, and if it has no c, it will have brown color. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that checkered is determined by c, and the others are determined by B. So perhaps the presence of c affects the color (making it checkered), but the presence of B affects the pigment color (making it brown or red). So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\n- For body color:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: CC BB, Cc BB, CC Bb, Cc Bb\n2. C_bb: Cc bb\n3. cc_B_: cc BB, cc Bb\n4. cc_bb: cc bb\n\nNow, since all offspring from F1 \u00d7 F1 (where F1 is CcBb) will have the genotype CcBb, which means they have at least one C and at least one B. Therefore, all of them will exhibit both traits. Therefore, all phenotypes will occur, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking back at the options, option D says a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:9:3, which seems more complex. Option E has a ratio of 3:1:1:1, but that's not what our analysis shows.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in reality, the parents' genotypes might lead to varying ratios. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, which is the only possible genotype, and all F2 would inherit from CcBb. So the F2 would all be CcBb, leading to all four phenotypes occurring equally. But according to the options, none seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A through J provide various ratios. The correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this. Instead, the closest option is G: 12:2:2:2, but that's not matching either. H has 5:3:2:6, which is also off. E has 3:1:1:3, which could correspond to a ratio of 3:1:1:3, but that's not what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Maybe the problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, implying that c is the only allele responsible for checkering, and c is recessive. Therefore, if a bird has at least one c, it will be checkered, regardless of the presence of C. Similarly, if a bird has at least one B, it will be brown, otherwise, it will be plain. So the presence of c masks the color, making it checkered, but the presence of B makes it brown, and without B makes it plain. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of c and B. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ : Red and Brown\n2. C_bb : Red and Checkered\n3. cc_B_ : Plain and Brown\n4. cc_bb : Plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes can be calculated based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB and cc bb, so all F1 will be CcBb. Therefore, the F2 will consist of all CcBb individuals, which means all four phenotypes will occur equally, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly state 1:1:1:1. The closest is option E: 3:1:1:3, which sums to 8, but that's not matching. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18, which is also not matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. None of these seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is c, meaning that only when both alleles are c do you get checkered. The rest (even one c) is still plain. Similarly, for color, B is brown, b is checkered. So perhaps the presence of c affects color, masking it. So a bird with c in either allele would be checkered, regardless of the color. Wait, no\u2014because in the problem, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, meaning that c is the only allele that results in checkered. So if a bird has at least one c, it's checkered, regardless of the color. And if it has at least one B, it's brown; else, it's plain. Therefore, the phenotype depends on both genes: if there's at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown), it's red-brown; otherwise, it's plain-checkered or red-checkered.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. C_B_ : Red and Brown\n2. C_bb : Red and Checkered\n3. cc_B_ : Plain and Brown\n4. cc_bb : Plain and Checkered\n\nAnd the probabilities for each are calculated based on the parents' genotypes. Since both parents are CC BB and cc bb, all their offspring will be CcBb, which means they will have at least one C and at least one B. Therefore, all four phenotypes will occur equally, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. Looking at the options, option E has a ratio of 3:1:1:3, which could imply a different setup, possibly with parents contributing differently. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous for both genes, but that's not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the checkered pattern is independent of the color, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are different. Let me double-check the problem statement: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, meaning that only when both alleles are c does the checkering appear. But in reality, that's not how it works in most cases\u2014usually, a single dominant allele masks the recessive one. Wait, but here, the checkered pattern is a separate trait from color. So perhaps the presence of c affects the color, making it checkered, regardless of the B/B status. Similarly, the presence of B affects the color, making it brown, regardless of c.\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- For checkered: presence of c (at least one c)\n- For color: presence of B (at least one B)\n\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. C_B_ : Red and Brown\n2. C_bb : Red and Checkered\n3. cc_B_ : Plain and Brown\n4. cc_bb : Plain and Checkered\n\nSince all offspring from F1 \u00d7 F1 are CcBb, they will all have at least one C and at least one B, thus all four phenotypes will occur equally, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since the options don't include this, I must reconsider my approach.\n\nPerhaps the parents are not both fully heterozygous. Wait, the problem states that one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb, and F2 will be all CcBb as well. Therefore, all four phenotypes should occur equally, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since this isn't among the options, I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not as described. Wait, the problem says one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb. So all F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would consist of all possible combinations, including CcBb, CcBb, etc. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this. \n\nLooking back at the options, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18, suggesting three phenotypes. Option E is 3:1:1:3, adding to 8. Option H is 5:3:2:6, summing to 16. Option A is 6:2:6:2, summing to 16. Option B is 6:2:6:2, same as A. Option C is 9:3:3:1, summing to 16. Option D is 1:3:9:3, summing to 16. Option I is 7:5:1:3, summing to 16.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3. This resembles a standard Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio, but perhaps it's considering the segregation of each gene separately. However, this would imply that the genes are independent, which they are in this case, but the phenotypic ratios combine multiplicatively. Wait, for example, the phenotypic ratio would be the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nGene C: presence (red) over absence (plain) \u2192 3/4\nGene B: presence (brown) over absence (checkered) \u2192 3/4\n\nTotal phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, but this doesn't account for the interaction between the genes. Alternatively, considering the combination of both genes, the phenotypic ratio could be (number of red and brown)/(total) = 9/(9+3+3+1)=9/16, but that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, considering that each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes, each with certain probabilities. In a typical dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which matches option G (9:3:3:1). But in our case, since all F2 individuals are CcBb, which means they have at least one C and at least one B, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_B_: All four phenotypes except plain-checkered (cc_bb)\n- C_bb: Only red and checkered\n- cc_B_: Only plain and brown\n- cc_bb: Only plain and checkered\n\nBut since all F2 are CcBb, all four phenotypes occur equally, which would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, assuming that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, treating each gene independently. However, this assumes that each bird can exhibit any combination of the traits, which isn't the case here because all F2 individuals are CcBb, ensuring all four phenotypes are present equally. \n\nGiven that, and since none of the options match 1:1:1:1, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 9:3:3:1, assuming that each bird can exhibit any combination of the traits based on the genes, ignoring the fact that all F2 are CcBb. Alternatively, maybe the parents were meant to be different, such as one being CC cc and the other BB bb, allowing for independent assortment and the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Without further information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. So let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird has two independent genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles. To find the phenotypic ratio, we calculate the number of birds in each category.\n\nThe probability of being phenotype 1 (Red and Brown) is the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene. Since both genes are dominant, this would always occur unless the bird is missing a dominant allele, which isn't possible here because the parents' genotypes allow for all combinations. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Actually, for each gene, the probability of expressing a dominant trait is higher than the recessive one. But in reality, each bird either expresses both traits or none. Wait, but that's not possible because the genes determine the expression, and both can be dominant, leading to both traits expressed. So all birds will have either both traits or neither, depending on their genotype.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Both traits can coexist regardless of dominance. So each bird can have both traits, or one, or neither, depending on their alleles. But given the dominance hierarchy, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will display both. If a bird has one dominant allele for a trait and one recessive for the other, it will display that trait. If a bird has no dominant alleles for either trait, it won't display any.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypic ratios are based on how often each combination occurs. So for the C locus: presence (C) or absence (c); same for B. Each gene has three possibilities if dominance allowed, but in this case, since both traits require at least one dominant allele, the actual phenotypes are fourfold: RR (both dominant), Rr (only one dominant), rR (same as Rr), and rr (none).\n\nBut since both genes are under complete dominance (as indicated by the way the problem describes it, where \"dominant\" implies that the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding trait), the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (Red and Brown)\n2. Only Pigment Red (no Brown)\n3. Only Pigment Checkered (no Red)\n4. Neither trait expressed (Plain and Checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each category:\n\nFor Pigment Red and Brown (RR):\nThis requires at least one R (C) and at least one B (B). From the parents' genotypes, Parent 1 is CC BB, so all their offspring must receive C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 1. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so all their offspring must receive c from Parent 2 and b from Parent 2. Therefore, all offspring from F1 \u00d7 F1 (which are the same as F2 here) must be CcBb. Therefore, all birds in F2 will have at least one C and at least one B, meaning all four phenotypic categories will occur. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 100%.\n\nBut that contradicts the answer choices, which suggest different ratios. Hmm. Maybe I've misunderstood something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, so c is the recessive allele for checkered. The checkered pattern arises when both c and c alleles are present (i.e., cc). The checkered pattern is an epistatic effect, meaning the presence of a dominant allele for pigment (C) masks the checkered pattern if c is present. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So c is the only allele that results in checkered, while C is for pigment. So if a bird has at least one C, it will have red pigment. If it also has at least one c, then it will be checkered. Otherwise, if it has no C, it will have plain color, and if it has no c, it will have brown color. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that checkered is determined by c, and the others are determined by B. So perhaps the presence of c affects the color (making it checkered), but the presence of B affects the pigment color (making it brown or red). So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\n- For body color:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: CC BB, Cc BB, CC Bb, Cc Bb\n2. C_bb: Cc bb\n3. cc_B_: cc BB, cc Bb\n4. cc_bb: cc bb\n\nNow, since all offspring from F1 \u00d7 F1 (where F1 is CcBb) will have the genotype CcBb, which means they have at least one C and at least one B. Therefore, all of them will exhibit both traits. Therefore, all phenotypes will occur, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking back at the options, option D says a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:9:3, which seems more complex. Option E has a ratio of 3:1:1:1, but that's not what our analysis shows.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in reality, the parents' genotypes might lead to varying ratios. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, which is the only possible genotype, and all F2 would inherit from CcBb. So the F2 would all be CcBb, leading to all four phenotypes occurring equally. But according to the options, none seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A through J provide various ratios. The correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this. Instead, the closest option is G: 12:2:2:2, but that's not matching either. H has 5:3:2:6, which is also off. E has 3:1:1:3, which could correspond to a ratio of 3:1:1:3, but that's not what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Maybe the problem states that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, implying that c is the only allele responsible for checkering, and c is recessive. Therefore, if a bird has at least one c, it will be checkered, regardless of the presence of C. Similarly, if a bird has at least one B, it will be brown, otherwise, it will be plain. So the presence of c masks the color, making it checkered, but the presence of B makes it brown, and without B makes it plain. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of c and B. Thus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ : Red and Brown\n2. C_bb : Red and Checkered\n3. cc_B_ : Plain and Brown\n4. cc_bb : Plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes can be calculated based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB and cc bb, so all F1 will be CcBb.

The closest is option E: 3:1:1:3, which sums to 8, but that's not matching. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18, which is also not matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16. Option J is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. None of these seem to fit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is c, meaning that only when both alleles are c do you get checkered. The rest (even one c) is still plain. Similarly, for color, B is brown, b is checkered. So perhaps the presence of c affects color, masking it. So a bird with c in either allele would be checkered, regardless of the color.

Alternatively, considering the combination of both genes, the phenotypic ratio could be (number of red and brown)/(total) = 9/(9+3+3+1)=9/16, but that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, considering that each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes, each with certain probabilities. In a typical dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which matches option G (9:3:3:1). But in our case, since all F2 individuals are CcBb, which means they have at least one C and at least one B, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_B_: All four phenotypes except plain-checkered (cc_bb)\n- C_bb: Only red and checkered\n- cc_B_: Only plain and brown\n- cc_bb: Only plain and checkered\n\nBut since all F2 are CcBb, all four phenotypes occur equally, which would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but this isn't reflected in any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, assuming that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, treating each gene independently. However, this assumes that each bird can exhibit any combination of the traits, which isn't the case here because all F2 individuals are CcBb, ensuring all four phenotypes are present equally. \n\nGiven that, and since none of the options match 1:1:1:1, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which is 9:3:3:1, assuming that each bird can exhibit any combination of the traits based on the genes, ignoring the fact that all F2 are CcBb. Alternatively, maybe the parents were meant to be different, such as one being CC cc and the other BB bb, allowing for independent assortment and the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Without further information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotypic ratio would be determined by how often each combination of dominant or recessive alleles appears across both genes.",
    "rollout": " So the phenotypic ratio would be determined by how often each combination of dominant or recessive alleles appears across both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Each bird has two genes: C and B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (C dominant, pigment red)\n- Cc (C dominant, pigment red)\n- cc (c recessive, plain)\n\nFor B (body color):\n- BB (B dominant, brown)\n- Bb (B dominant, brown)\n- bb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. To get the phenotypic ratio, we consider all possible combinations where either or both traits are expressed according to the dominant alleles.\n\nSo for each bird, the probability of having a certain phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown\nThis happens when C is dominant (pigment red) AND B is dominant (brown). So P = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But that can't be right because it implies 100% of the birds have both traits, which isn't the case here because some birds won't have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C dominant (pigment red) regardless of B, then it will have red and whatever B is. Similarly, if B is dominant, it'll have brown, regardless of C. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the question is, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nTo calculate this, we need to know the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in the offspring. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 generation will be CcBb. Let's look at each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- Parent 1: CC (all C dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (all c recessive)\nSo F1 will be Cc (50% C, 50% c)\nThus, for pigment color:\n- 50% Pigment red (C)\n- 50% Plain (c)\n\nFor Gene B (body color):\n- Parent 1: BB (all B dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (all b recessive)\nSo F1 will be Bb (50% B dominant, 50% b recessive)\nThus, for body color:\n- 50% Brown (B)\n- 50% Checkered (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each phenotype, we combine the probabilities of the two genes.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that sums up to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back, the options given don't seem to match this exact distribution. Wait, but none of the answer choices A-F are exactly 25% for each phenotype. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nC. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 summing to 16\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 summing to 16\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2013 summing to 12\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nL. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 same as above\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2013 same as H\nN. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2013 same as J\nO. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 same as K\nP. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 same as G\n\nWait, none of the options directly match my calculation of 25% each phenotype. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the user included a table in the Q&A section, but it seems to be part of the prompt. Looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"Please provide your answer with only a single letter.\"\n\nAnd the actual multiple-choice answers were labeled from A to N, with varying numbers for each phenotype. For instance, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Option F sums to 16 as well. Option G sums to 16. Option H sums to 16. Option I sums to 16. Option J sums to 12, etc.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, leading to 4 phenotypes each with 4 instances in a population of 16. But perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation rather than the entire class of birds. Maybe the initial cross was between F1 and F1, but the user mentioned F2. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the user's message, after the adihybrid cross, they listed a gametes table for F1: (CB)(cb). Then, the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would be formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in four combinations: CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, cb \u00d7 cb. Each of these would produce gametes CB, cb, cB, cb respectively. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: Cc BB\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: cc Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown (both dominant)\n2. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, for the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of each phenotype there are. Assuming equal probability for each gamete, each F2 genotype occurs in a 25% ratio. However, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds in the population. If we assume a large population, each phenotype would theoretically appear 25% of the time, but the options don't reflect this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors not accounted for in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe the F2 ratios based on different considerations, such as the double recessive genotype (cc bb) being absent or considered as a separate phenotype. But that would complicate things further.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer back to standard dihybrid cross calculations. In a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and dominant completely, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each phenotype. However, none of the options match this exactly. Perhaps the user intended to include a typo or misrepresentation in the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. Let me recalculate. The F1 is CcBb. If we look at the F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype. But the options don't align with this. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but in the initial setup, it's stated as adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret the question differently. The user mentions an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid refers to crossing heterozygotes. So perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the second is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, as previously discussed. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield the F2 generation. As established, F2 would have four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nHowever, none of the options reflect a 25% distribution. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of the F2. If so, let's see what the F1 phenotypic ratio would be. The F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 25%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 25%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 25%\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype in a large population, say 16 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest option with 4 checkered red and 4 checkered brown would be option K, which states 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown. That doesn't add up. Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\u2014summing to 12, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about a different type of cross, such as a test cross from F1 to a recessive background, but that wouldn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the F1 and F2 generations. Let me try to proceed without making assumptions. The correct F2 phenotypic ratio should have each phenotype at 25% if each gene is segregating independently and fully dominant. But none of the options reflect this. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation, and the options are presented incorrectly. For instance, option G says checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 0. That adds up to 16, matching the denominator. But why would checkered brown be zero? Because if both genes are recessive, it's checkered, not brown. Wait, no\u2014a bird with c in both genes would be plain. Only if B is present, it's brown. So if both c and b are recessive, it's plain. If B is present, it's brown. So the phenotype brown includes both B dominant and B recessive. Wait, no\u2014phenotype brown is when B is dominant (regardless of B's presence?), but that's not accurate. Phenotype brown requires at least one dominant B allele. Similarly, checkered requires both b and c alleles.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (so both traits expressed)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. Therefore, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the cases. So in a population of 16 birds, each phenotype should occur 4 times.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. This suggests that checkered red is less common than expected.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 0. Again, checkered brown is zero, which shouldn't be the case.\n\nPerhaps the user meant to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Without further information, I cannot confidently choose the correct option. However, if I had to guess based on the most logical approach, I might lean towards option E or G, depending on the desired outcome. But given the complexity and potential errors in the options, it's challenging to select the correct one definitively.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be determined by how often each combination of dominant or recessive alleles appears across both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Each bird has two genes: C and B. The possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (C dominant, pigment red)\n- Cc (C dominant, pigment red)\n- cc (c recessive, plain)\n\nFor B (body color):\n- BB (B dominant, brown)\n- Bb (B dominant, brown)\n- bb (b recessive, checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. To get the phenotypic ratio, we consider all possible combinations where either or both traits are expressed according to the dominant alleles.\n\nSo for each bird, the probability of having a certain phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown\nThis happens when C is dominant (pigment red) AND B is dominant (brown). So P = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1. But that can't be right because it implies 100% of the birds have both traits, which isn't the case here because some birds won't have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C dominant (pigment red) regardless of B, then it will have red and whatever B is. Similarly, if B is dominant, it'll have brown, regardless of C. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the question is, what's the probability of each phenotype?\n\nTo calculate this, we need to know the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive in the offspring. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 generation will be CcBb. Let's look at each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- Parent 1: CC (all C dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (all c recessive)\nSo F1 will be Cc (50% C, 50% c)\nThus, for pigment color:\n- 50% Pigment red (C)\n- 50% Plain (c)\n\nFor Gene B (body color):\n- Parent 1: BB (all B dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (all b recessive)\nSo F1 will be Bb (50% B dominant, 50% b recessive)\nThus, for body color:\n- 50% Brown (B)\n- 50% Checkered (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each phenotype, we combine the probabilities of the two genes.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but that sums up to 100%, which makes sense. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back, the options given don't seem to match this exact distribution. Wait, but none of the answer choices A-F are exactly 25% for each phenotype. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nC. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 summing to 16\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 summing to 16\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2013 summing to 12\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 summing to 16\nL. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2013 same as above\nM. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2013 same as H\nN. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown \u2013 same as J\nO. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2013 same as K\nP. 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown \u2013 same as G\n\nWait, none of the options directly match my calculation of 25% each phenotype. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the user included a table in the Q&A section, but it seems to be part of the prompt. Looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"Please provide your answer with only a single letter.\"\n\nAnd the actual multiple-choice answers were labeled from A to N, with varying numbers for each phenotype. For instance, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Option F sums to 16 as well. Option G sums to 16. Option H sums to 16. Option I sums to 16. Option J sums to 12, etc.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, leading to 4 phenotypes each with 4 instances in a population of 16. But perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation rather than the entire class of birds. Maybe the initial cross was between F1 and F1, but the user mentioned F2. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the user's message, after the adihybrid cross, they listed a gametes table for F1: (CB)(cb). Then, the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 would be formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in four combinations: CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 CB, cb \u00d7 cb. Each of these would produce gametes CB, cb, cB, cb respectively. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: Cc BB\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: cc Bb\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown (both dominant)\n2. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, for the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine how many of each phenotype there are. Assuming equal probability for each gamete, each F2 genotype occurs in a 25% ratio. However, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds in the population. If we assume a large population, each phenotype would theoretically appear 25% of the time, but the options don't reflect this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions, possibly due to incomplete dominance or other factors not accounted for in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to describe the F2 ratios based on different considerations, such as the double recessive genotype (cc bb) being absent or considered as a separate phenotype. But that would complicate things further.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer back to standard dihybrid cross calculations. In a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and dominant completely, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 25% for each phenotype. However, none of the options match this exactly. Perhaps the user intended to include a typo or misrepresentation in the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. Let me recalculate. The F1 is CcBb. If we look at the F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype. But the options don't align with this. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 instead of F2, but in the initial setup, it's stated as adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret the question differently. The user mentions an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid refers to crossing heterozygotes. So perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the second is homozygous plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb, as previously discussed. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield the F2 generation. As established, F2 would have four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nHowever, none of the options reflect a 25% distribution. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation instead of the F2. If so, let's see what the F1 phenotypic ratio would be. The F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): 25%\n3. Plain (c) AND Brown (B): 25%\n4. Plain (c) AND Checkered (b): 25%\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype in a large population, say 16 birds, each phenotype would occur 4 times. However, none of the options reflect this. The closest option with 4 checkered red and 4 checkered brown would be option K, which states 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown. That doesn't add up. Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\u2014summing to 12, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the options. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about a different type of cross, such as a test cross from F1 to a recessive background, but that wouldn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the F1 and F2 generations. Let me try to proceed without making assumptions. The correct F2 phenotypic ratio should have each phenotype at 25% if each gene is segregating independently and fully dominant. But none of the options reflect this. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 generation, and the options are presented incorrectly. For instance, option G says checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 0. That adds up to 16, matching the denominator. But why would checkered brown be zero? Because if both genes are recessive, it's checkered, not brown. Wait, no\u2014a bird with c in both genes would be plain. Only if B is present, it's brown. So if both c and b are recessive, it's plain. If B is present, it's brown. So the phenotype brown includes both B dominant and B recessive. Wait, no\u2014phenotype brown is when B is dominant (regardless of B's presence?), but that's not accurate. Phenotype brown requires at least one dominant B allele. Similarly, checkered requires both b and c alleles.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red and brown (so both traits expressed)\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nEach phenotype corresponds to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. Therefore, each phenotype occurs in 25% of the cases. So in a population of 16 birds, each phenotype should occur 4 times.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. This suggests that checkered red is less common than expected.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 0. Again, checkered brown is zero, which shouldn't be the case.\n\nPerhaps the user meant to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Without further information, I cannot confidently choose the correct option. However, if I had to guess based on the most logical approach, I might lean towards option E or G, depending on the desired outcome. But given the complexity and potential errors in the options, it's challenging to select the correct one definitively.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't appear. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Pigment red, Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain, Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain, Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B)\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be because if C is always dominant, and B is always dominant, then all birds would have both traits. But that contradicts the example given in the options where the phenotypic ratio isn't 100%, so perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the dominant allele in each gene contributes to the phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So let's consider the actual possible phenotypes based on the genes:\n\nEach bird has two genes, each contributing to the phenotype. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_): both dominant\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb): dominant pigment, recessive brown\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_): recessive pigment, dominant brown\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb): recessive pigment, recessive brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are determined by the combination of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires that the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n- Probability = P(C present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n- This requires C present and b present (since B is recessive).\n- Probability = P(C present) * P(b present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B)\n- Requires c present and B present.\n- Probability = P(c present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n- Requires c present and b present.\n- Probability = P(c present) * P(b present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, but that suggests that all phenotypes occur 100%, which can't be correct because the question provides various options with different ratios. Perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the genes' contributions. Let me reconsider: Maybe the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the respective trait appearing, but not necessarily all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring with certain probabilities.\n\nGiven that, let me list the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C and B dominant\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype B: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype C: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c and B dominant\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype D: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nThat still seems off because the problem states that the answer choices include ratios like 6, 2, etc. So perhaps my understanding is wrong. Maybe the presence of a dominant allele in one gene makes the corresponding trait expressed, but not both together. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, resulting in four possible phenotypes, each with varying probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the same bird could have different combinations depending on the alleles. Let me try a different approach. Instead of looking at all possible combinations, let's look at each gene separately and see how they combine.\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nGene B (body):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. But since each bird's alleles are independent, the possible phenotypes can be categorized based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene can be either dominant or recessive, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, each combination has a certain probability. Let's calculate them:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of a dominant allele (for pigment) is 1 (since both parents have at least one dominant allele), and the probability of recessive is 0 (but wait, that's not quite accurate because the parents may carry both alleles). Wait, let's reevaluate. Each parent is homozygous for one gene, but what about the other gene?\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 for gene C: CC, so C dominant. For gene B: BB, so B dominant. So he can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 for gene C: cc, so c recessive. For gene B: bb, so b recessive. So he can only give cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, making all F1's CB gametes. Thus, all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50%). Therefore, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (assuming random assortment, but in reality, it's 25% for each combination).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc (c recessive, c recessive) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. bb (b recessive, b recessive) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the proportion of each genotype:\n\nEach genotype occurs with a probability of 25%, but the phenotypes aren't equally represented unless each phenotype corresponds to exactly one genotype. However, looking back, each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, so:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1) : 25% of the cases\n- Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2) : 25% of the cases\n- Plain and brown (phenotype 3) : 25% of the cases\n- Plain and checkered (phenotype 4) : 25% of the cases\n\nAdding these up, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which sums up to 100%. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exact ratio. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOptions range from 1:1:1:1 to 4:4:4:4, but none seem to match exactly. However, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance model. Another possibility is that each gene's effect combines, leading to multiple phenotypes without equal representation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, not the combination. In that case, the number of phenotypes would be fewer. But the options don't show 4:4:4:4 either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype, assuming that each genotype leads directly to a specific phenotype. For instance, if both genes are present (C and B), the bird is red and brown. If only pigment is present (C and b), it's red and checkered. Similarly for the other combinations.\n\nIn that case, each phenotype would correspond to a unique genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options do not include such a ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, option G says \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That adds up to 16, which doesn't align with our expectation of 16 (four phenotypes, each 25%).\n\nOption J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" adding up to 12, which also doesn't fit. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" totaling 16, which again fits 1:1:1:1 ratio but scaled differently. However, none of the options perfectly represent the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something earlier. Let me double-check the calculations. Each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, so each should indeed account for 25% of the population. But looking at the options, none directly state 1:1:1:1, except option E, which does. However, option E's numbers add up to 16, which is consistent with four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nBut according to my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 1/4 of the birds should exhibit each phenotype. If the total population is N, then each phenotype would have N/4. But the options provide counts rather than percentages. So, if the total number of offspring is, say, 16 (to avoid fractions), then each phenotype would have 4 birds, giving a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But that's not reflected in any option beyond option E.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to sum the number of each phenotype based on their occurrence. Let me consider each phenotype's frequency:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 2): C dominant, b recessive. Genotype Ccbb. Since CcBb is 25%, and Ccbb would require C dominant and b recessive. So the probability of Ccbb is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4, but wait, that's not accurate because in F2, the C locus is independent of the B locus. So the probability of Ccbb is the product of the probabilities of C dominant and B recessive: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. But wait, that's within the context of F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's approach it methodically.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 25% C dominant (red), 25% c recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: 25% B dominant (brown), 25% b recessive (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits. To find the number of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities for each combination:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): P(C) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): P(C) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which matches our earlier conclusion. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the offspring.\n\nIf we assume a total of 16 birds (a round number divisible by 4), then each phenotype would have 4 birds, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. However, looking at the options, option E says \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which totals 16. If each phenotype corresponds to 4 birds, but the numbers don't align, perhaps the underlying assumption is different. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, not the absolute count.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion of each phenotype. So if each phenotype is 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options perfectly reflect this, except option E, which shows 4:4:4:4 when scaled appropriately.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. If each phenotype is 25%, then 4 would correspond to each. But 3, 9, 1, 3 sum to 16. Dividing each by 4 gives 1, 2.25, 0.25, 0.75, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented as counts, not percentages, and the ratios are meant to compare among themselves, not overall. \n\nBut without the actual context, it's challenging to determine the correct option. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the most likely answer would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't exactly present in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the inheritance. Let me revisit the initial assumption.\n\nAnother approach: Since the two genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which states a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that seems too skewed. Alternatively, option E presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a 1:3:3:1 distribution, often seen in dihybrids, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering the adi hybrid cross. Maybe the F2 generation isn't the same as the dihybrid cross described. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross between a homozygous bird and a heterozygous bird, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question specifically mentions an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid crosses involve two parents producing a dihybrid offspring, which is what I did earlier, leading to F2 with 25% each genotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly present this ratio. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" totaling 16 birds. If each phenotype is supposed to have 4 birds (25%), then dividing each by 4 gives 1, 2.25, 0.25, 0.75, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are relative, not absolute. So, 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 The ratio between Checkered red and plain red is 3:1, and similarly for Checkered brown and plain brown is 9:3. But that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the F2 generation to be considered as dihybrid, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not applicable here because the parents are not dihybrids. They are one homozygous and one heterozygous. Therefore, the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the closest is option E, which uses 3:9:1:3, but that's inconsistent with our analysis. Alternatively, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our expectations either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the basics. Each gene is inherited independently, so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. None of the options match this, but looking at option E, it has 3:9:1:3, which is a common ratio in dihybrid crosses, but that's not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic expression in terms of the number of each trait, regardless of the others. If we consider that each bird has four possible phenotypes, and their counts are distributed accordingly, perhaps the ratio is different. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding these up gives 16. If each phenotype is supposed to be 25%, then 12, 2, 2, 0 would imply that checkered red is 12 (which is 75%), but that contradicts the 25% expected. Therefore, this must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation of a dihybrid",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, then the corresponding trait won't appear. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Pigment red, Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain, Brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain, Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B)\n- Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be because if C is always dominant, and B is always dominant, then all birds would have both traits. But that contradicts the example given in the options where the phenotypic ratio isn't 100%, so perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the dominant allele in each gene contributes to the phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So let's consider the actual possible phenotypes based on the genes:\n\nEach bird has two genes, each contributing to the phenotype. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_): both dominant\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb): dominant pigment, recessive brown\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_): recessive pigment, dominant brown\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb): recessive pigment, recessive brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are determined by the combination of the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since both genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nThis requires that the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n- Probability = P(C present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b)\n- This requires C present and b present (since B is recessive).\n- Probability = P(C present) * P(b present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B)\n- Requires c present and B present.\n- Probability = P(c present) * P(B present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b)\n- Requires c present and b present.\n- Probability = P(c present) * P(b present) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nWait, but that suggests that all phenotypes occur 100%, which can't be correct because the question provides various options with different ratios. Perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the genes' contributions. Let me reconsider: Maybe the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in the respective trait appearing, but not necessarily all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring with certain probabilities.\n\nGiven that, let me list the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 C and B dominant\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype B: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C dominant, B recessive\nProbability = P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype C: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 c and B dominant\nProbability = P(c) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype D: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b recessive\nProbability = P(c) * P(b) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nThat still seems off because the problem states that the answer choices include ratios like 6, 2, etc. So perhaps my understanding is wrong. Maybe the presence of a dominant allele in one gene makes the corresponding trait expressed, but not both together. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene, resulting in four possible phenotypes, each with varying probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the same bird could have different combinations depending on the alleles. Let me try a different approach. Instead of looking at all possible combinations, let's look at each gene separately and see how they combine.\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nGene B (body):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. But since each bird's alleles are independent, the possible phenotypes can be categorized based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene can be either dominant or recessive, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, each combination has a certain probability. Let's calculate them:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of a dominant allele (for pigment) is 1 (since both parents have at least one dominant allele), and the probability of recessive is 0 (but wait, that's not quite accurate because the parents may carry both alleles). Wait, let's reevaluate. Each parent is homozygous for one gene, but what about the other gene?\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 for gene C: CC, so C dominant. For gene B: BB, so B dominant. So he can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 for gene C: cc, so c recessive. For gene B: bb, so b recessive. So he can only give cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, making all F1's CB gametes. Thus, all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50%). Therefore, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (assuming random assortment, but in reality, it's 25% for each combination).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will be:\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, C dominant) \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc (C dominant, c recessive) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc (c recessive, c recessive) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. bb (b recessive, b recessive) \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratio based on the proportion of each genotype:\n\nEach genotype occurs with a probability of 25%, but the phenotypes aren't equally represented unless each phenotype corresponds to exactly one genotype. However, looking back, each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, so:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1) : 25% of the cases\n- Pigment red and checkered (phenotype 2) : 25% of the cases\n- Plain and brown (phenotype 3) : 25% of the cases\n- Plain and checkered (phenotype 4) : 25% of the cases\n\nAdding these up, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which sums up to 100%. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exact ratio. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOptions range from 1:1:1:1 to 4:4:4:4, but none seem to match exactly. However, perhaps I misunderstood the inheritance model. Another possibility is that each gene's effect combines, leading to multiple phenotypes without equal representation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, not the combination. In that case, the number of phenotypes would be fewer. But the options don't show 4:4:4:4 either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype, assuming that each genotype leads directly to a specific phenotype. For instance, if both genes are present (C and B), the bird is red and brown. If only pigment is present (C and b), it's red and checkered. Similarly for the other combinations.\n\nIn that case, each phenotype would correspond to a unique genotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options do not include such a ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, option G says \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That adds up to 16, which doesn't align with our expectation of 16 (four phenotypes, each 25%).\n\nOption J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" adding up to 12, which also doesn't fit. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" totaling 16, which again fits 1:1:1:1 ratio but scaled differently. However, none of the options perfectly represent the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated something earlier. Let me double-check the calculations. Each phenotype corresponds to one genotype, so each should indeed account for 25% of the population. But looking at the options, none directly state 1:1:1:1, except option E, which does. However, option E's numbers add up to 16, which is consistent with four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nBut according to my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so 1/4 of the birds should exhibit each phenotype. If the total population is N, then each phenotype would have N/4. But the options provide counts rather than percentages. So, if the total number of offspring is, say, 16 (to avoid fractions), then each phenotype would have 4 birds, giving a 4:4:4:4 ratio. But that's not reflected in any option beyond option E.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to sum the number of each phenotype based on their occurrence. Let me consider each phenotype's frequency:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 2): C dominant, b recessive. Genotype Ccbb. Since CcBb is 25%, and Ccbb would require C dominant and b recessive. So the probability of Ccbb is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4, but wait, that's not accurate because in F2, the C locus is independent of the B locus. So the probability of Ccbb is the product of the probabilities of C dominant and B recessive: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. But wait, that's within the context of F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's approach it methodically.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 25% C dominant (red), 25% c recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: 25% B dominant (brown), 25% b recessive (checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits. To find the number of each phenotype, we can calculate the probabilities for each combination:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): P(C) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): P(C) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): P(c) * P(B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): P(c) * P(b) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% * 4 = 25%, which matches our earlier conclusion. So each phenotype accounts for 25% of the offspring.\n\nIf we assume a total of 16 birds (a round number divisible by 4), then each phenotype would have 4 birds, leading to a 4:4:4:4 ratio. However, looking at the options, option E says \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which totals 16. If each phenotype corresponds to 4 birds, but the numbers don't align, perhaps the underlying assumption is different. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, not the absolute count.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion of each phenotype. So if each phenotype is 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options perfectly reflect this, except option E, which shows 4:4:4:4 when scaled appropriately.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. If each phenotype is 25%, then 4 would correspond to each. But 3, 9, 1, 3 sum to 16. Dividing each by 4 gives 1, 2.25, 0.25, 0.75, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented as counts, not percentages, and the ratios are meant to compare among themselves, not overall. \n\nBut without the actual context, it's challenging to determine the correct option. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, the most likely answer would be a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't exactly present in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the inheritance. Let me revisit the initial assumption.\n\nAnother approach: Since the two genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which states a 12:2:2:0 ratio, but that seems too skewed. Alternatively, option E presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a 1:3:3:1 distribution, often seen in dihybrids, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering the adi hybrid cross. Maybe the F2 generation isn't the same as the dihybrid cross described. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross between a homozygous bird and a heterozygous bird, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question specifically mentions an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid crosses involve two parents producing a dihybrid offspring, which is what I did earlier, leading to F2 with 25% each genotype. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly present this ratio. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" totaling 16 birds. If each phenotype is supposed to have 4 birds (25%), then dividing each by 4 gives 1, 2.25, 0.25, 0.75, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are relative, not absolute. So, 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 The ratio between Checkered red and plain red is 3:1, and similarly for Checkered brown and plain brown is 9:3. But that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the F2 generation to be considered as dihybrid, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not applicable here because the parents are not dihybrids. They are one homozygous and one heterozygous. Therefore, the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the closest is option E, which uses 3:9:1:3, but that's inconsistent with our analysis. Alternatively, option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit our expectations either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the basics. Each gene is inherited independently, so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. None of the options match this, but looking at option E, it has 3:9:1:3, which is a common ratio in dihybrid crosses, but that's not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic expression in terms of the number of each trait, regardless of the others. If we consider that each bird has four possible phenotypes, and their counts are distributed accordingly, perhaps the ratio is different. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding these up gives 16. If each phenotype is supposed to be 25%, then 12, 2, 2, 0 would imply that checkered red is 12 (which is 75%), but that contradicts the 25% expected. Therefore, this must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation of a dihybrid",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait.",
    "rollout": " If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not how dominance works. In dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant C allele, it'll be red, regardless of the B alleles. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B allele, it'll be brown. So the only way a bird doesn\u2019t have brown is if it has no dominant B alleles, i.e., bb. Similarly, the only way it doesn\u2019t have red is if it has no dominant C alleles, i.e., cc.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C_B_\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_bb\n3. Plain and brown: cc_B_\n4. Plain and checkered: cc_bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes: \n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 CcBb\n2. C_bb \u2192 ccBb\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 ccBb\n4. cc_bb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that can't be right because CcBb and ccBb are different. Let me clarify:\n\nThe F2 generation will consist of four types of genotypes based on the independent assortment of two genes:\n\n1. C_C_ \u2192 (probability 25% for each gene, so 25% overall)\n2. C_c_ \u2192 (25%)\n3. _C_ \u2192 same as above\n4. _c_ \u2192 same\n\nBut wait, no\u2014each gene is segregating into two possibilities. So the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations of the two genes. Let me try to list them properly:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red, checkered (C_bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain, brown (ccB_)\nPhenotype 4: Plain, checkered (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the genes assort independently, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nFor Pigment red and brown (Phenotype 1):\n- Probability of C_ (p = 3/4, since C is dominant)\n- Probability of B_ (q = 3/4, since B is dominant)\nSo combined probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2248 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. However, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, the actual phenotypic outcome is determined by whether each trait is expressed. So, the four phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. \n\nLet me approach this differently by considering each gene separately:\n\nGene C (pigment):\n\n- C_: pigment red (dominant)\n- cc_: plain (recessive)\n\nGene B (body color):\n\n- B_: brown (dominant)\n- bb_: checkered (recessive)\n\nSince each bird must express both traits if both genes are dominant, the phenotypes are combinations where both traits are present if both genes are dominant, or absent if one is recessive. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C_ and B_ present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ but bb for B)\n3. Plain and brown (cc for C but B_ for B)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc for C and bb for B)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene's expression.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant \u2192 P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb) \u2192 P(C_) * P(bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain (cc) and brown (B_) \u2192 P(cc) * P(B_) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain (cc) and checkered (bb) \u2192 P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9 parts\nPhenotype 2: 3 parts\nPhenotype 3: 3 parts\nPhenotype 4: 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered): 3 parts, but option D says checkered brown (Phenotype 2) as 3, and checkered red (Phenotype 1) as 1. Hmm, that seems off. Option A has checkered red as 6, which is double what we have.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user said:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous understanding. Earlier, I thought B was dominant for brown, but now I see that in the problem statement, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, correcting that:\n\nRed is dominant (B), brown is recessive (b).\n\nWait, that changes everything! Because previously, I thought B was dominant for brown, but the problem states that brown is controlled by the recessive allele b, making it the dominant trait. So, let me redo the analysis with this corrected understanding.\n\nGiven the corrected problem:\n\n- Gene B (brown color): \n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n- Gene C (pigment color):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, the F1 generated from a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red (which would be cc bb, since checkered is recessive for both traits)\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown (which would be CC bb, since plain is recessive for pigment, but brown is recessive for color)\n\nWait, but the problem states that the parents are a homozygous checkered red (so cc bb) and a plain brown (so CC bb). So, the F1 would be the dihybrid cross between cc bb and CC bb.\n\nWait, but let's clarify the genotypes:\n\nParent 1: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both B and c)\nParent 2: CC bb (homozygous dominant for C and recessive for c)\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 would be:\n\nParent 1 (cc bb) can only produce gametes: cb\nParent 2 (CC bb) can also only produce gametes: CB\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would come from selfing F1 (CcBb). Let's determine the F2 genotypes.\n\nAs before, F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes with either C/B or c/b. Specifically, the gametes would be:\n\n- From C locus: C (frequency 50%) or c (50%)\n- From B locus: B (50%) or b (50%)\n\nThus, the possible gametes are:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bB\n- 25% bb\n\nWait, but considering only the dominant traits, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, the F2 phenotypes depend on:\n\n- C_: pigment red (dominant)\n- B_: brown color (dominant)\n\nAnd:\n\n- c_: plain (recessive)\n- b_: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C_b_ \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c_B_ \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c_b_ \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_B_): Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (C_b_): Probability = P(C_) * P(b_) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (c_B_): Probability = P(c_) * P(B_) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (c_b_): Probability = P(c_) * P(b_) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSumming these gives 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nConverting these to ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9\nPhenotype 2: 3\nPhenotype 3: 3\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nTotal: 16 parts\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Let me look through them again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, none of these seem to match 9:3:3:1. Did I misinterpret something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the problem statement again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, here's the confusion! Initially, I thought B was dominant for brown, but the problem states that brown is controlled by the recessive allele b. So, brown is the dominant trait, and checkered is the recessive. Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Brown: dominant (B)\n- Checkered: recessive (b)\n\nSimilarly, for pigment color:\n\n- Red: dominant (C)\n- Plain: recessive (c)\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic classes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant \u2192Plain, brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive \u2192Plain, checkered\n\nWith the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 3: c_B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 4: c_b_ \u2192 (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nWhich sums to 16/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, I don't see this exact ratio. The closest option is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but that's exactly the ratio I got: 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but checking the options again:\n\nOption C lists checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, plain brown as 1. Yes, that matches perfectly.\n\nBut wait, the options are presented as:\n\nA. ... 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 7,5,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nSo option C matches our calculated ratio of 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not how dominance works. In dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant C allele, it'll be red, regardless of the B alleles. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B allele, it'll be brown. So the only way a bird doesn\u2019t have brown is if it has no dominant B alleles, i.e., bb. Similarly, the only way it doesn\u2019t have red is if it has no dominant C alleles, i.e., cc.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C_B_\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C_bb\n3. Plain and brown: cc_B_\n4. Plain and checkered: cc_bb\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific genotypes: \n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 CcBb\n2. C_bb \u2192 ccBb\n3. cc_B_ \u2192 ccBb\n4. cc_bb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that can't be right because CcBb and ccBb are different. Let me clarify:\n\nThe F2 generation will consist of four types of genotypes based on the independent assortment of two genes:\n\n1. C_C_ \u2192 (probability 25% for each gene, so 25% overall)\n2. C_c_ \u2192 (25%)\n3. _C_ \u2192 same as above\n4. _c_ \u2192 same\n\nBut wait, no\u2014each gene is segregating into two possibilities. So the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations of the two genes. Let me try to list them properly:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant \u2192 Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red, checkered (C_bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain, brown (ccB_)\nPhenotype 4: Plain, checkered (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the genes assort independently, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nFor Pigment red and brown (Phenotype 1):\n- Probability of C_ (p = 3/4, since C is dominant)\n- Probability of B_ (q = 3/4, since B is dominant)\nSo combined probability = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2248 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because if both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. However, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, the actual phenotypic outcome is determined by whether each trait is expressed. So, the four phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. \n\nLet me approach this differently by considering each gene separately:\n\nGene C (pigment):\n\n- C_: pigment red (dominant)\n- cc_: plain (recessive)\n\nGene B (body color):\n\n- B_: brown (dominant)\n- bb_: checkered (recessive)\n\nSince each bird must express both traits if both genes are dominant, the phenotypes are combinations where both traits are present if both genes are dominant, or absent if one is recessive. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both C_ and B_ present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ but bb for B)\n3. Plain and brown (cc for C but B_ for B)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc for C and bb for B)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene's expression.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both genes dominant \u2192 P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C_) and checkered (bb) \u2192 P(C_) * P(bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain (cc) and brown (B_) \u2192 P(cc) * P(B_) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain (cc) and checkered (bb) \u2192 P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9 parts\nPhenotype 2: 3 parts\nPhenotype 3: 3 parts\nPhenotype 4: 1 part\n\nTotal parts: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered): 3 parts, but option D says checkered brown (Phenotype 2) as 3, and checkered red (Phenotype 1) as 1. Hmm, that seems off. Option A has checkered red as 6, which is double what we have.\n\nAlternatively, looking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user said:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous understanding. Earlier, I thought B was dominant for brown, but now I see that in the problem statement, \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, correcting that:\n\nRed is dominant (B), brown is recessive (b).\n\nWait, that changes everything! Because previously, I thought B was dominant for brown, but the problem states that brown is controlled by the recessive allele b, making it the dominant trait. So, let me redo the analysis with this corrected understanding.\n\nGiven the corrected problem:\n\n- Gene B (brown color): \n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n- Gene C (pigment color):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, the F1 generated from a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red (which would be cc bb, since checkered is recessive for both traits)\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown (which would be CC bb, since plain is recessive for pigment, but brown is recessive for color)\n\nWait, but the problem states that the parents are a homozygous checkered red (so cc bb) and a plain brown (so CC bb). So, the F1 would be the dihybrid cross between cc bb and CC bb.\n\nWait, but let's clarify the genotypes:\n\nParent 1: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both B and c)\nParent 2: CC bb (homozygous dominant for C and recessive for c)\n\nWhen these two parents are crossed, the F1 would be:\n\nParent 1 (cc bb) can only produce gametes: cb\nParent 2 (CC bb) can also only produce gametes: CB\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would come from selfing F1 (CcBb). Let's determine the F2 genotypes.\n\nAs before, F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes with either C/B or c/b. Specifically, the gametes would be:\n\n- From C locus: C (frequency 50%) or c (50%)\n- From B locus: B (50%) or b (50%)\n\nThus, the possible gametes are:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bB\n- 25% bb\n\nWait, but considering only the dominant traits, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So, the F2 phenotypes depend on:\n\n- C_: pigment red (dominant)\n- B_: brown color (dominant)\n\nAnd:\n\n- c_: plain (recessive)\n- b_: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C_b_ \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. c_B_ \u2192 Plain and brown\n4. c_b_ \u2192 Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_B_): Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (C_b_): Probability = P(C_) * P(b_) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (c_B_): Probability = P(c_) * P(B_) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (c_b_): Probability = P(c_) * P(b_) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSumming these gives 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nConverting these to ratios:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9\nPhenotype 2: 3\nPhenotype 3: 3\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nTotal: 16 parts\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype 1 : Phenotype 2 : Phenotype 3 : Phenotype 4.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Let me look through them again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, none of these seem to match 9:3:3:1. Did I misinterpret something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the problem statement again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, here's the confusion! Initially, I thought B was dominant for brown, but the problem states that brown is controlled by the recessive allele b. So, brown is the dominant trait, and checkered is the recessive. Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Brown: dominant (B)\n- Checkered: recessive (b)\n\nSimilarly, for pigment color:\n\n- Red: dominant (C)\n- Plain: recessive (c)\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic classes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant \u2192Plain, brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive \u2192Plain, checkered\n\nWith the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\nPhenotype 2: C_b_ \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 3: c_B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\nPhenotype 4: c_b_ \u2192 (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nWhich sums to 16/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, I don't see this exact ratio. The closest option is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but that's exactly the ratio I got: 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but checking the options again:\n\nOption C lists checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, plain brown as 1. Yes, that matches perfectly.\n\nBut wait, the options are presented as:\n\nA. ... 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 7,5,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nSo option C matches our calculated ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer options, option C does indeed have the correct ratio.

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So all birds in this cross will have both traits unless one gene is recessive.",
    "rollout": " So all birds in this cross will have both traits unless one gene is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, then it will display both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. So let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the bird is homozygous for pigment (CC) and homozygous for color (bb). So in reality, the bird will always have pigment red (because C is dominant) and color brown (because B is dominant). Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, regardless of the alleles. That seems odd because it suggests that every bird in the F2 generation will have both traits, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where some individuals may be missing certain traits due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, the problem states that the dominant allele for pigment makes it red, and the dominant allele for color makes it brown. So the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will exhibit both traits, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. The plain color is determined by recessive c. So, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B) to express both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So in this case, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, but looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. None seem to match my conclusion. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed if both genes are recessive?\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by gene C. So if C is recessive (c), the pattern is checkered. Similarly, for color, if B is recessive (b), the color is plain. So the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the corresponding trait being expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red and 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the options reflect this. So perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is expressed when the C gene is dominant (C_), and plain color is expressed when the c gene is dominant (c_). Therefore, all birds with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have both traits. Hence, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. Looking at the options, none seem to fit this. Am I making a wrong assumption here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Maybe the presence of one dominant allele determines the trait, while the other is silent. So, for example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will have red color, regardless of the color gene. And if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will have brown, regardless of the pigment gene. In that case, all birds would have both traits, so the same conclusion applies. Still, none of the options align with this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider that the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits). Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. As earlier, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (50%): Checkered red and checkered red\n- Cc (25%): Checkered red and plain brown\n- cc (25%): Plain red and plain brown\n- bb (25%): Checkered red and plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the actual combination depends on the independent assortment of the two genes. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, for each trait:\n\n- Pigment red (C_): presence \u2192 red\n- Plain (c_): presence \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\n- Brown (B_): presence \u2192 brown\n- Checkered (b_): presence \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. For example, a bird could have pigment red and brown (both dominant), which would be red and brown. A bird could have pigment red and checkered (but since pigment is determined by C, it can't be checkered without c). Wait, no\u2014a bird with C_ will have pigment red, but if it also has B_, it'll have brown. If it has C_ and b_, it'll have red and checkered. Similarly, if it has c_ and B_, it'll have plain and brown. If it has c_ and b_, it'll have plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain red and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, let's determine how often each of these occurs in the F2 generation. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParental gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nCrossing them together:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%) (no, wait, when you cross CB with CB, all offspring get CB. Wait, no\u2014when you cross two heterozygotes, the F1 is Cc, and the F2 is CC, Cc, cc. But in our case, the parents are each producing CB and cb gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\nFrom CB gamete + CB gamete: CC\nFrom CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc\nFrom cb gamete + CB gamete: Cc\nFrom cb gamete + cb gamete: cc\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, 50%, and 25%. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (b_) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: Same as above\n- cc: Pigment plain (c_), Color plain (b_) \u2192 plain plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 red checkered\n- 50% Cc \u2192 red brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain plain\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for the number of birds. Each F2 bird has two copies of each gene, so the counts would be 1 (for CC), 2 (for Cc), and 1 (for cc). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of birds would be:\n\n- Red checkered: 1/4 of the population\n- Red brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Plain plain: 1/4\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation, so I need to count the number of birds that fall into each category. Assuming the total number of birds is 4 (since each F2 bird is a diploid), the counts would be:\n\n- 1 bird with red checkered\n- 2 birds with red brown\n- 1 bird with plain plain\n\nBut wait, this isn't matching any of the given options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to a phenotypic classification of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Not sure what this refers to.\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nGiven that, perhaps I made an error in considering the dominance. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed when both genes are recessive. That is, only when an individual is homozygous recessive (cc), do they express the checkered pattern. Similarly, only when both genes are recessive (bb) do they express the plain color. Otherwise, they display the dominant traits. This would change the analysis.\n\nIn that case, the F2 generation would have the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (only possible if both C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only possible if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Plain red and brown (only possible if c and B are dominant)\n4. Plain red and checkered (only possible if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's see how many birds fall into each category. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits).\n\nTheir F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant pigment, dominant color)\n- 25% Cc (dominant pigment, recessive color)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive pigment, recessive color)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive pigment, dominant color)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, color red \u2192 red red\n2. Cc: Pigment red, color brown \u2192 red brown\n3. cc: Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, color red \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, counting the number of birds:\n\n- CC: 1/4 of the population \u2192 red red\n- Cc: 2/4 \u2192 red brown\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 plain red\n\nAssuming a population of 4 birds:\n\n- 1 red red\n- 2 red brown\n- 1 plain brown\n- 1 plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic dihybrid crosses, treating each gene separately without considering the interaction between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that each bird exhibits both traits regardless of the alleles, leading to a 100% red phenotype and ignoring brown and checkered. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: The problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), so when C is present, it's checkered. Similarly, for color, B is dominant, so when B is present, it's brown. Therefore, any bird with C_ and B_ will have both traits (red and brown). Any bird with C_ and b_ will have red and checkered. Any bird with c_ and B_ will have plain and brown. Any bird with c_ and b_ will have plain and checkered.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\nParental gametes are CB and cb.\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: \n\nFrom CB + CB \u2192 CC (red, red)\nCB + cb \u2192 Cc (red, brown)\ncb + CB \u2192 Cc (red, brown)\ncb + cb \u2192 cc (plain, plain)\n\nSo, in terms of F2:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 red red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 red brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain plain\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options except possibly G and H, which don't align with this calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses the concept of blending rather than dominance, but that seems unlikely given the standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat each trait independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined under the assumption that all combinations are equally likely. However, this would lead to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 8:4:0:4. That adds up to 16, which would imply 8 red red, 4 red brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. How does that come about? Maybe considering all possible combinations of the two genes, but not accounting for the dominance properly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of dominant alleles instead of the presence of traits.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the F2 generation with the assumption that a bird has both traits only if both genes are dominant. So:\n\n- CC: Both genes dominant \u2192 red red\n- Cc: One dominant \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: Same as above\n- cc: Neither dominant \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the checkered pattern as only expressed when both genes are recessive, i.e., only when cc is present. Similarly, the plain color is expressed only when bb is present. So, the F2 would have:\n\n- cc: Only checkered \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- bb: Only plain \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- cc + bb: Both recessive \u2192 plain plain\n- cc + bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Wait, no\u2014F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) selfed, so the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each with specific frequencies.\n\nBut if the problem is considering that only when both genes are recessive (cc) do you get checkered, and when both are dominant (BB) do you get plain, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, color red \u2192 red red\n- Cc: Pigment red, color brown \u2192 red brown\n- cc: Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, color red \u2192 plain red\n\nAnd the counts would be:\n\n- CC: 1/4 \u2192 red red\n- Cc: 2/4 \u2192 red brown\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich again doesn't align with the options provided. \n\nPerhaps the issue is that the problem is considering the number of dominant alleles, not the presence of traits. For example, each bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). The presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait results in the respective trait being expressed. Thus, all birds would have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% red and brown, 0% red and checkered, etc. Again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option B: 8:4:0:4, which suggests that the F2 generation includes 8 birds with red red, 4 with red brown, 0 with plain red, and 4 with plain brown. This would happen if each trait is considered independently without considering the interaction between them. For example, considering the dominance hierarchy without considering the genes' interactions, but that's unconventional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem incorrectly combines the dominance hierarchies, such as considering that both genes must be dominant for a trait to appear, leading to fewer phenotypic categories.\n\nIn any case, given the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer based on the problem's phrasing and the options provided is option B: 8:4:0:4.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So all birds in this cross will have both traits unless one gene is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color, then it will display both traits. If either gene is recessive, it won't display that trait. So let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant, red) = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain) = 0\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, no\u2014the bird is homozygous for pigment (CC) and homozygous for color (bb). So in reality, the bird will always have pigment red (because C is dominant) and color brown (because B is dominant). Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, regardless of the alleles. That seems odd because it suggests that every bird in the F2 generation will have both traits, which contradicts typical dihybrid crosses where some individuals may be missing certain traits due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, in this case, the problem states that the dominant allele for pigment makes it red, and the dominant allele for color makes it brown. So the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will exhibit both traits, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. The plain color is determined by recessive c. So, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B) to express both traits. If either gene is recessive, the bird won't have that trait. So in this case, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, but looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. None seem to match my conclusion. Perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed if both genes are recessive?\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by gene C. So if C is recessive (c), the pattern is checkered. Similarly, for color, if B is recessive (b), the color is plain. So the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the corresponding trait being expressed. Therefore, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red and 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the options reflect this. So perhaps I've misread the problem. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is expressed when the C gene is dominant (C_), and plain color is expressed when the c gene is dominant (c_). Therefore, all birds with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have both traits. Hence, all F2 birds will have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. Looking at the options, none seem to fit this. Am I making a wrong assumption here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Maybe the presence of one dominant allele determines the trait, while the other is silent. So, for example, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it will have red color, regardless of the color gene. And if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it will have brown, regardless of the pigment gene. In that case, all birds would have both traits, so the same conclusion applies. Still, none of the options align with this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 generation. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider that the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits). Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. As earlier, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (50%): Checkered red and checkered red\n- Cc (25%): Checkered red and plain brown\n- cc (25%): Plain red and plain brown\n- bb (25%): Checkered red and plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the actual combination depends on the independent assortment of the two genes. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, for each trait:\n\n- Pigment red (C_): presence \u2192 red\n- Plain (c_): presence \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly for color:\n\n- Brown (B_): presence \u2192 brown\n- Checkered (b_): presence \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. For example, a bird could have pigment red and brown (both dominant), which would be red and brown. A bird could have pigment red and checkered (but since pigment is determined by C, it can't be checkered without c). Wait, no\u2014a bird with C_ will have pigment red, but if it also has B_, it'll have brown. If it has C_ and b_, it'll have red and checkered. Similarly, if it has c_ and B_, it'll have plain and brown. If it has c_ and b_, it'll have plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain red and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, let's determine how often each of these occurs in the F2 generation. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParental gametes: CB and cb (each 50%)\n\nCrossing them together:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%) (no, wait, when you cross CB with CB, all offspring get CB. Wait, no\u2014when you cross two heterozygotes, the F1 is Cc, and the F2 is CC, Cc, cc. But in our case, the parents are each producing CB and cb gametes. So the F2 would include:\n\nFrom CB gamete + CB gamete: CC\nFrom CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc\nFrom cb gamete + CB gamete: Cc\nFrom cb gamete + cb gamete: cc\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, 50%, and 25%. Now, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C_), Color checkered (b_) \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc: Pigment red (C_), Color brown (B_) \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: Same as above\n- cc: Pigment plain (c_), Color plain (b_) \u2192 plain plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 red checkered\n- 50% Cc \u2192 red brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain plain\n\nHowever, this doesn't account for the number of birds. Each F2 bird has two copies of each gene, so the counts would be 1 (for CC), 2 (for Cc), and 1 (for cc). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of birds would be:\n\n- Red checkered: 1/4 of the population\n- Red brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Plain plain: 1/4\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation, so I need to count the number of birds that fall into each category. Assuming the total number of birds is 4 (since each F2 bird is a diploid), the counts would be:\n\n- 1 bird with red checkered\n- 2 birds with red brown\n- 1 bird with plain plain\n\nBut wait, this isn't matching any of the given options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to a phenotypic classification of 100% checkered red, 0% checkered brown, 0% plain red, and 0% plain brown. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Not sure what this refers to.\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 1:3:9:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nGiven that, perhaps I made an error in considering the dominance. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed when both genes are recessive. That is, only when an individual is homozygous recessive (cc), do they express the checkered pattern. Similarly, only when both genes are recessive (bb) do they express the plain color. Otherwise, they display the dominant traits. This would change the analysis.\n\nIn that case, the F2 generation would have the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (only possible if both C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only possible if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Plain red and brown (only possible if c and B are dominant)\n4. Plain red and checkered (only possible if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, let's see how many birds fall into each category. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for pigment) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits).\n\nTheir F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant pigment, dominant color)\n- 25% Cc (dominant pigment, recessive color)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive pigment, recessive color)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive pigment, dominant color)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red, color red \u2192 red red\n2. Cc: Pigment red, color brown \u2192 red brown\n3. cc: Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. bb: Pigment plain, color red \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, counting the number of birds:\n\n- CC: 1/4 of the population \u2192 red red\n- Cc: 2/4 \u2192 red brown\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 plain red\n\nAssuming a population of 4 birds:\n\n- 1 red red\n- 2 red brown\n- 1 plain brown\n- 1 plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy beyond the basic dihybrid crosses, treating each gene separately without considering the interaction between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that each bird exhibits both traits regardless of the alleles, leading to a 100% red phenotype and ignoring brown and checkered. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: The problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant), so when C is present, it's checkered. Similarly, for color, B is dominant, so when B is present, it's brown. Therefore, any bird with C_ and B_ will have both traits (red and brown). Any bird with C_ and b_ will have red and checkered. Any bird with c_ and B_ will have plain and brown. Any bird with c_ and b_ will have plain and checkered.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\nParental gametes are CB and cb.\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: \n\nFrom CB + CB \u2192 CC (red, red)\nCB + cb \u2192 Cc (red, brown)\ncb + CB \u2192 Cc (red, brown)\ncb + cb \u2192 cc (plain, plain)\n\nSo, in terms of F2:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 red red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 red brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain plain\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options except possibly G and H, which don't align with this calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses the concept of blending rather than dominance, but that seems unlikely given the standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat each trait independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait, but combined under the assumption that all combinations are equally likely. However, this would lead to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 8:4:0:4. That adds up to 16, which would imply 8 red red, 4 red brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. How does that come about? Maybe considering all possible combinations of the two genes, but not accounting for the dominance properly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of dominant alleles instead of the presence of traits.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the F2 generation with the assumption that a bird has both traits only if both genes are dominant. So:\n\n- CC: Both genes dominant \u2192 red red\n- Cc: One dominant \u2192 red brown\n- Cc: Same as above\n- cc: Neither dominant \u2192 plain plain\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the checkered pattern as only expressed when both genes are recessive, i.e., only when cc is present. Similarly, the plain color is expressed only when bb is present. So, the F2 would have:\n\n- cc: Only checkered \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- bb: Only plain \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- cc + bb: Both recessive \u2192 plain plain\n- cc + bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Wait, no\u2014F2 would be from F1 (CcBb) selfed, so the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb, each with specific frequencies.\n\nBut if the problem is considering that only when both genes are recessive (cc) do you get checkered, and when both are dominant (BB) do you get plain, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, color red \u2192 red red\n- Cc: Pigment red, color brown \u2192 red brown\n- cc: Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: Pigment plain, color red \u2192 plain red\n\nAnd the counts would be:\n\n- CC: 1/4 \u2192 red red\n- Cc: 2/4 \u2192 red brown\n- cc: 1/4 \u2192 plain brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich again doesn't align with the options provided. \n\nPerhaps the issue is that the problem is considering the number of dominant alleles, not the presence of traits. For example, each bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two for color (B and b). The presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait results in the respective trait being expressed. Thus, all birds would have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100% red and brown, 0% red and checkered, etc. Again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option B: 8:4:0:4, which suggests that the F2 generation includes 8 birds with red red, 4 with red brown, 0 with plain red, and 4 with plain brown. This would happen if each trait is considered independently without considering the interaction between them. For example, considering the dominance hierarchy without considering the genes' interactions, but that's unconventional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem incorrectly combines the dominance hierarchies, such as considering that both genes must be dominant for a trait to appear, leading to fewer phenotypic categories.\n\nIn any case, given the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer based on the problem's phrasing and the options provided is option B: 8:4:0:4.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those traits accordingly.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those traits accordingly. So the actual calculation needs to consider the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each gene separately and then combine the results. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0 (since c is recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0 (since b is recessive)\n\nSo, looking at each bird, they will always have pigment red and brown, regardless of the B locus. Therefore, all birds in the population will display both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds have only one trait. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of a dominant allele for both traits ensures both traits are expressed. Therefore, every bird in this population will have both traits, making all phenotypes identical except for the dominance status within each gene. Wait, but that's not practical. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the genes don't work together, but rather, the phenotypes are determined solely by one gene, but that seems unlikely given the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the genes are working multiplicatively, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. In that case, each bird will have both traits, but the way the options are presented might suggest different scenarios. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the problem.\n\nThe problem states: - Gene C controls pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Gene B controls color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n- The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nIn an adihybrid cross, which involves two genes, the F1 generation would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing F1. Wait, but the user's initial instruction was about a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird, resulting in F1 and F2. However, the user also mentions a complete Punnett square for adi-hybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red and a plain brown bird. Wait, perhaps I misread the initial part. Let me go back.\n\nThe original question says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the cross is between CC BB (homogeneous dominant) and cc bb (homogeneous recessive). The F1 would be CcBb, as I thought before. The F2 would be generated by selfing F1. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of the gametes from F1. As each F1 individual can only produce CB and cb gametes (since both parents are homozygous), the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each parent can only provide CB or cb, so the F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, the F2 individuals would be formed by combining these gametes, leading to the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's analyze each gene:\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n- Phenotype: Pigment red (if C present)\n- Phenotype: Plain (if c present)\n- All F2 individuals have at least one C (either from the mother or father), so all will have Pigment red.\n\nGene B (color):\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n- Phenotype: Brown (if B present)\n- Phenotype: Checkered (if b present)\n- All F2 individuals have at least one B (either from the mother or father), so all will have Brown.\n\nTherefore, all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown. But that's a bit unusual because typically, a bird could have either pigment or color, but not both. Wait, but according to the problem, both traits are expressed unless one is recessive. But in reality, it's possible for a bird to have only one trait. However, in this specific scenario, since both genes are dominant, all birds will have both traits. This might mean that the answer options reflect this outcome.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit our conclusion.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, because all should be Pigment red and Brown.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, all should be Pigment red and Brown.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, same issue.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Still no match.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to fit my conclusion that all F2 are Pigment red and Brown. But perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me reread the question.\n\nOh! Wait a minute\u2014I think I got confused with the parent cross. The user initially said: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, now I realize that in the initial setup, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, the F2 would be generated by selfing F1. So, the F2 would consist of the four possible combinations of the F1 gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Now, applying Mendel's laws, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n- 25% CcBb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 25% ccBB (c and B dominant)\n- 25% ccbB (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Pigment red (C present): All have Pigment red\n- Brown (B present): All have Brown\nThus, all F2 birds have both Pigment red and Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100%, but since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about both traits being expressed, but rather that some birds may have only one trait due to one of the genes being recessive. But according to the given setup, both parents are homozygous for dominant traits. So the F2 should always exhibit both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be all Pigment red and Brown.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them align with this expectation. Unless I'm missing something, such as the actual expression of one trait overriding the other under certain conditions, which is not indicated in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the problem refers to a dihybrid cross where each gene is controlled by its own pair of alleles, and both are required to express the traits. Thus, the F2 should have all individuals expressing both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume that both traits are expressed regardless, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but again, this isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended approach is to treat each gene independently and calculate the probabilities without considering dominance. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- P(Pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- P(Plain) = 0\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- P(Brown) = 1\n- P(Checkered) = 0\n\nThus, all F2 individuals would have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed to consider the dominance hierarchy in a different way, where only one trait is expressed unless the other is present. But the problem states that both traits are determined by separate genes, so dominance applies individually. Hence, all F2 would have both traits, making the options inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that a bird can have only one trait if one of the genes is recessive. But in this case, both parents are homozygous dominant for both traits, so all F2 should have both. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio shouldn't have any zero counts.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis would imply that all F2 have both traits, but the numbers add up to 16, which fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but in terms of counts, it would require 4 each, not 12 and 2. So Option G seems off.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nAgain, 16 total, but distribution doesn't match.\n\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nHere, all phenotypes are equally represented, but according to our analysis, all should have both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio considering that only one trait is expressed unless the other is present. But the problem doesn't specify this; it just describes the traits based on dominant alleles. So I think my initial conclusion stands: all F2 have both traits, so the phenotypic ratio should be 100% for both Pigment red and Brown. None of the options reflect this, suggesting that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem entirely.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous for both traits, but perhaps one is homozygous for one trait and the other is homozygous for the other. Wait, the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow as described.\n\nIf I must choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is Option J, which shows 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, that adds up to 12, which is less than 16, so perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only one trait, treating both genes as contributing to the same phenotype, which wouldn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly worded, and instead of dihybrid cross, it's a mono-hybrid cross. But the initial description clearly states dihybrid cross.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended approach is to recognize that all F2 would have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of dihybrid crosses and expecting students to apply the Punnett square correctly, leading to the correct ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's for a different kind of cross, such as a single hybrid cross. In this case, since we're dealing with a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and a homozygous recessive, the F2 ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intending to use a monohybrid cross, but the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is E, which reflects a 3:1 ratio, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the order of dominance affects the phenotype. For instance, if B is dominant over b, then any bird with B would have brown, and vice versa. But in this case, both genes are dominant, so all would have both traits, so the ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Based on the initial reasoning, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to a 1:1 ratio for each trait, resulting in 1:2:1:2 or similar. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the genes, thinking that one is dominant and the other recessive, leading to different ratios. Without further information, I think the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that all F2 have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is Option G, which sums to 16, but the distribution is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be CcBb. When crossed, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (both traits dominant)\n- 25% CcBb (pigment red, brown dominant)\n- 25% ccBB (plain, brown dominant)\n- 25% c cbb (plain, checkered)\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- Pigment red (C): all have this trait\n- Brown (B): all have this trait\n\nTherefore, all F2 have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which is not among the options. This suggests that perhaps the problem is intended to test a different concept, such as the number of each phenotype when considering dominance hierarchies, but without clear instructions on how to handle dominance, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is Option G, which distributes the traits evenly, but that's not supported by the reasoning above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the two genes are acting independently, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, that's not represented in the options.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I think I need to conclude that none of the options perfectly fit the reasoning, but perhaps the intended answer is Option G, which sums to 16 and has equal numbers for each phenotype, despite the reasoning suggesting otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but without considering dominance across both genes. That is, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether pigment red (C) or plain (c) is present, and similarly for color. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nThen, the F2 genotypes would lead to these phenotypes. Let's see:\n\nFrom F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Brown\n- ccBB: Plain, Brown\n- ccbb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (from CC BB and CcBb)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (from ccBB)\n3. Plain and Brown (from ccBB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (from ccbb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the F2 generation, which includes the phenotypic ratio. According to this, the ratio would be 2:1:1:1, which is 16 parts, with Pigment red and Brown having 8 parts, others 4 each. But that's not what the options say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is treating each trait independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect that.\n\nAt this point, I think the most",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have those traits accordingly. So the actual calculation needs to consider the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each gene separately and then combine the results. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0 (since c is recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0 (since b is recessive)\n\nSo, looking at each bird, they will always have pigment red and brown, regardless of the B locus. Therefore, all birds in the population will display both traits. But that contradicts the idea that some birds have only one trait. Wait, no\u2014because the presence of a dominant allele for both traits ensures both traits are expressed. Therefore, every bird in this population will have both traits, making all phenotypes identical except for the dominance status within each gene. Wait, but that's not practical. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the genes don't work together, but rather, the phenotypes are determined solely by one gene, but that seems unlikely given the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the genes are working multiplicatively, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles across both genes. In that case, each bird will have both traits, but the way the options are presented might suggest different scenarios. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the problem.\n\nThe problem states: - Gene C controls pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Gene B controls color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n- The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nIn an adihybrid cross, which involves two genes, the F1 generation would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing F1. Wait, but the user's initial instruction was about a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird, resulting in F1 and F2. However, the user also mentions a complete Punnett square for adi-hybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red and a plain brown bird. Wait, perhaps I misread the initial part. Let me go back.\n\nThe original question says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the cross is between CC BB (homogeneous dominant) and cc bb (homogeneous recessive). The F1 would be CcBb, as I thought before. The F2 would be generated by selfing F1. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of the gametes from F1. As each F1 individual can only produce CB and cb gametes (since both parents are homozygous), the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each parent can only provide CB or cb, so the F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would consist of four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Now, the F2 individuals would be formed by combining these gametes, leading to the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (50%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's analyze each gene:\n\nGene C (pigment):\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n- Phenotype: Pigment red (if C present)\n- Phenotype: Plain (if c present)\n- All F2 individuals have at least one C (either from the mother or father), so all will have Pigment red.\n\nGene B (color):\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n- Phenotype: Brown (if B present)\n- Phenotype: Checkered (if b present)\n- All F2 individuals have at least one B (either from the mother or father), so all will have Brown.\n\nTherefore, all F2 birds will have both Pigment red and Brown. But that's a bit unusual because typically, a bird could have either pigment or color, but not both. Wait, but according to the problem, both traits are expressed unless one is recessive. But in reality, it's possible for a bird to have only one trait. However, in this specific scenario, since both genes are dominant, all birds will have both traits. This might mean that the answer options reflect this outcome.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit our conclusion.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, because all should be Pigment red and Brown.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, all should be Pigment red and Brown.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, same issue.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Still no match.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to fit my conclusion that all F2 are Pigment red and Brown. But perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me reread the question.\n\nOh! Wait a minute\u2014I think I got confused with the parent cross. The user initially said: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, now I realize that in the initial setup, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, the F2 would be generated by selfing F1. So, the F2 would consist of the four possible combinations of the F1 gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Now, applying Mendel's laws, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all C and B dominant)\n- 25% CcBb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- 25% ccBB (c and B dominant)\n- 25% ccbB (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Pigment red (C present): All have Pigment red\n- Brown (B present): All have Brown\nThus, all F2 birds have both Pigment red and Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100%, but since the options don't reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about both traits being expressed, but rather that some birds may have only one trait due to one of the genes being recessive. But according to the given setup, both parents are homozygous for dominant traits. So the F2 should always exhibit both traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be all Pigment red and Brown.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them align with this expectation. Unless I'm missing something, such as the actual expression of one trait overriding the other under certain conditions, which is not indicated in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the problem refers to a dihybrid cross where each gene is controlled by its own pair of alleles, and both are required to express the traits. Thus, the F2 should have all individuals expressing both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and assume that both traits are expressed regardless, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but again, this isn't reflected in the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended approach is to treat each gene independently and calculate the probabilities without considering dominance. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- P(Pigment red) = 1 (since any C gives red)\n- P(Plain) = 0\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- P(Brown) = 1\n- P(Checkered) = 0\n\nThus, all F2 individuals would have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed to consider the dominance hierarchy in a different way, where only one trait is expressed unless the other is present. But the problem states that both traits are determined by separate genes, so dominance applies individually. Hence, all F2 would have both traits, making the options inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that a bird can have only one trait if one of the genes is recessive. But in this case, both parents are homozygous dominant for both traits, so all F2 should have both. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio shouldn't have any zero counts.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis would imply that all F2 have both traits, but the numbers add up to 16, which fits a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but in terms of counts, it would require 4 each, not 12 and 2. So Option G seems off.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nAgain, 16 total, but distribution doesn't match.\n\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nHere, all phenotypes are equally represented, but according to our analysis, all should have both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio considering that only one trait is expressed unless the other is present. But the problem doesn't specify this; it just describes the traits based on dominant alleles. So I think my initial conclusion stands: all F2 have both traits, so the phenotypic ratio should be 100% for both Pigment red and Brown. None of the options reflect this, suggesting that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem entirely.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parents are not both homozygous for both traits, but perhaps one is homozygous for one trait and the other is homozygous for the other. Wait, the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Therefore, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow as described.\n\nIf I must choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is Option J, which shows 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, that adds up to 12, which is less than 16, so perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only one trait, treating both genes as contributing to the same phenotype, which wouldn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly worded, and instead of dihybrid cross, it's a mono-hybrid cross. But the initial description clearly states dihybrid cross.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended approach is to recognize that all F2 would have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of dihybrid crosses and expecting students to apply the Punnett square correctly, leading to the correct ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's for a different kind of cross, such as a single hybrid cross. In this case, since we're dealing with a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and a homozygous recessive, the F2 ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intending to use a monohybrid cross, but the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is E, which reflects a 3:1 ratio, but I'm not sure why.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the order of dominance affects the phenotype. For instance, if B is dominant over b, then any bird with B would have brown, and vice versa. But in this case, both genes are dominant, so all would have both traits, so the ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Based on the initial reasoning, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and consider each trait independently, leading to a 1:1 ratio for each trait, resulting in 1:2:1:2 or similar. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the genes, thinking that one is dominant and the other recessive, leading to different ratios. Without further information, I think the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that all F2 have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is Option G, which sums to 16, but the distribution is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be CcBb. When crossed, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (both traits dominant)\n- 25% CcBb (pigment red, brown dominant)\n- 25% ccBB (plain, brown dominant)\n- 25% c cbb (plain, checkered)\n\nEach of these translates to:\n\n- Pigment red (C): all have this trait\n- Brown (B): all have this trait\n\nTherefore, all F2 have both traits, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which is not among the options. This suggests that perhaps the problem is intended to test a different concept, such as the number of each phenotype when considering dominance hierarchies, but without clear instructions on how to handle dominance, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is Option G, which distributes the traits evenly, but that's not supported by the reasoning above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the two genes are acting independently, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each trait, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But again, that's not represented in the options.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I think I need to conclude that none of the options perfectly fit the reasoning, but perhaps the intended answer is Option G, which sums to 16 and has equal numbers for each phenotype, despite the reasoning suggesting otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but without considering dominance across both genes. That is, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether pigment red (C) or plain (c) is present, and similarly for color. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Plain and Brown\n4. Plain and Checkered\n\nThen, the F2 genotypes would lead to these phenotypes. Let's see:\n\nFrom F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Brown\n- ccBB: Plain, Brown\n- ccbb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (from CC BB and CcBb)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (from ccBB)\n3. Plain and Brown (from ccBB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (from ccbb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 2/4 = 1/2\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and Brown: 1/4\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/4\n\nWhich simplifies to 2:1:1:1. But this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the F2 generation, which includes the phenotypic ratio. According to this, the ratio would be 2:1:1:1, which is 16 parts, with Pigment red and Brown having 8 parts, others 4 each. But that's not what the options say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is treating each trait independently, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options reflect that.\n\nAt this point, I think the most",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If either is recessive, then the opposite trait will be expressed.",
    "rollout": " If either is recessive, then the opposite trait will be expressed. So for example:\n\n- If a bird has C (pigment red) and B (body brown), it will have both traits.\n- If a bird has c (pigment plain) and B (brown), it will have brown and plain.\n- Similarly for other combinations.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Since each bird can express up to two traits, but each trait is dominant or recessive based on the alleles. Therefore, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and plain (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each category is calculated by looking at the possible alleles each parent contributes.\n\nParent 1 is CC BB. They can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb. They can only contribute c and b.\n\nWhen forming the F1, each parent produces gametes CB and cb. The F1 is CcBb. Now, when F1 selfs (F2), the possible gametes are CB and cb. The probabilities are:\n\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this seems off because the actual F2 should have four phenotypic categories, each with specific probabilities. Let me recast it properly. The F2 will consist of four phenotypic categories, each dependent on the combination of the two genes. Since the two genes are independent, the number of phenotypic classes is 2 x 2 = 4, each corresponding to a combination of dominant and recessive traits. The probabilities for each class are calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being dominant (for pigment) is 1 (since both parents are C/C, so all F2 have C). The probability of being recessive is 0. For the B gene, the same applies\u2014if both parents are B/B, all F2 have B. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits expressed\u2014so all phenotypes will be the combination of both dominant traits. This would imply that all F2 birds will have both pigment red and brown, regardless of the genotype. But that contradicts the given answer choices, which suggest varying phenotypic ratios. Perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the genes are acting independently, and each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. However, since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 could potentially have different combinations. Wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would consist of four phenotypic classes based on the combinations of the two genes. Each gene has two possible states, so the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1 if all combinations are equally likely. But according to the options provided, none seem to indicate equal distribution. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, hold on. The first parent is CC BB. It's homozygous for both genes, so any F2 bird will inherit either C or B from this parent. The second parent is cc bb, so any F2 bird will inherit either c or b from this parent. Therefore, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from C and c)\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- cc (from c and c)\n- BB (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nBut considering the inheritance from both parents, each gene is inherited separately. So for the C gene: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So F2 for C is Cc. Similarly, for B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F2 for B is Bb. Therefore, F2 genotypes are all CcBb, except when mixing alleles differently. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene, so F2 for C is Cc (from C and c), and for B is Bb (from B and b). Therefore, the F2 population consists of four possible combinations of Cc and Bb:\n\n1. CC (from C and c)\n2. Cc (from C and c)\n3. cc (from c and c)\n4. BB (from B and b)\n5. Bb (from B and b)\n6. bb (from b and b)\n\nHowever, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering each gene separately and then combining them. For each gene:\n\n- For C: 50% C (pigment red) and 50% c (plain)\n- For B: 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince the two genes determine different traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Since each gene is independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait in that phenotype. \n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability C = 1 (since both parents are C)\n   - Probability B = 1 (both parents are B)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype exists always.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b):\n   - Probability C = 1\n   - Probability b = 0 (since both parents are B/B)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\n3. Plain and brown (c and B):\n   - Probability c = 0\n   - Probability B = 1\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b):\n   - Probability c = 0\n   - Probability b = 0 (since both parents are B/B)\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\nWait, this can't be right because all F2 individuals would have at least pigment red and brown, making all phenotypes existent. But according to the answer choices, none of them show such a straightforward ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something about the inheritance.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygous for each gene. In this case, the first parent is CC BB, which means both genes are homozygous. The second parent is cc bb, also homozygous. So when crossed, the F1 will be CcBb, but when F1 selfs, the F2 will be:\n\nEach gene in F2 comes from one allele from each parent. For C, F1 has C and c, so F2 Cc. For B, F1 has B and b, so F2 Bb. Therefore, F2 genotypes are all CcBb, but the possible gametes are CB and cb. Thus, the F2 phenotypes depend on whether each parent contributes C or c and B or b. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (but wait, no\u2014because F2 Cc can combine with F2 Bb to give different combinations. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's use a Punnett square approach.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Itself, F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/2 CcBb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but the F2 population isn't all the same because the parents are homozygous. So the possible F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are 1:2:1 for the four possible phenotypes? No, because there are only three phenotypes, depending on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All individuals with CC or Cc and BB or Bb will have both traits expressed. So Phenotype 1: Red Brown (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs in individuals where C is present and b is absent. Looking at the F2 genotypes, only those with cc bb (i.e., cc) will have b. But wait, in the F2, the cc bb is 25%, but in terms of phenotype, it's Plain Checkered (phenotype 3).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs in individuals where c is absent and B is present. So any C present will allow for brown. So Phenotype 2: Red Brown?\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 Occurs in CC BB (25%) and CcBb (50%), so total 75%.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b recessive) \u2192 Only occurs in CcBb individuals where b is present. Wait, no\u2014CcBb includes both C and b, but in reality, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So any C present will mean pigment red, and any b present will mean checkered. Therefore, Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b) occurs in all CcBb individuals, which is 50% of the F2. But wait, no\u2014because in CcBb, the presence of C makes it Pigment red, and presence of b makes it Checkered. So all CcBb individuals will have both traits, hence Phenotype 1. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that all F2 individuals have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Therefore, they will all exhibit both traits, meaning the phenotypic ratio is 100%, but that conflicts with the answer choices. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the F2 phenotypic ratios based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each gene has two possible alleles (dominant and recessive), the possible phenotypic categories are four: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The probabilities for each are as follows:\n\n- Red-Brown: 25% (all individuals)\n- Red-Checkered: 0% (since if C is present, B must be present)\n- Plain-Brown: 25% (all individuals)\n- Plain-Checkered: 0% (since if B is present, it must be brown)\n\nThis would result in a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0. But none of the answer choices match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about how the F2 generations manifest.\n\nWait, maybe the F2 individuals don't all express both traits. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene, but instead, the F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the F2 may include a mix of Cc and Bb, leading to partial expression. However, that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 without considering the F1's contributions beyond the initial cross. Let's assume that the F2 is derived solely from the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. When crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 genotypes are as previously discussed: 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, 25% cc bb.\n\nNow, applying Mendelian rules, each gene segregates independently. For the C locus: 50% C and 50% c. For the B locus: 50% B and 50% b. The phenotypes are determined by the combination of these. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios are determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1 for each possible combination. But since all F2 individuals inherit at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for color (B), all will express both traits, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is not all CcBb, but rather includes some Cc and Bb alleles from the F1, leading to different F2 genotypes. Let me re-examine the F1 cross.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CcBb x CcBb, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Each has a 25% chance.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are as above. Now, applying the phenotypic rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 dominant traits, so Phenotype 1: 25% (from CC BB)\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25% (from CC Bb) + 25% (from Cc BB) + 25% (from Cc Bb) = 75%?\nWait, no. Each genotype has its own phenotype based on the combination of C and B. Wait, let me correct this.\n\nFor each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 2/4 (50%)\n- Phenotype 3: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3/4 (75%)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent because each F2 individual's phenotype depends on both genes, so the overall count should sum appropriately. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (1/4)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (1/4)\n- CC bb: Phenotype 2 (1/4)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n\nAdding up the Pheno 2 instances: CC Bb (1/4) + CC bb (1/4) = 2/4 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 2/4\nPheno 1: 1/4\nPheno 3: remaining 3/4 (since 1+2=3, 9-3=6; but wait, 9 total F2 individuals: 1 Phenotype 1, 2 Phenotype 2, 6 Phenotype 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either is recessive, then the opposite trait will be expressed. So for example:\n\n- If a bird has C (pigment red) and B (body brown), it will have both traits.\n- If a bird has c (pigment plain) and B (brown), it will have brown and plain.\n- Similarly for other combinations.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Since each bird can express up to two traits, but each trait is dominant or recessive based on the alleles. Therefore, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and plain (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and plain (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each category is calculated by looking at the possible alleles each parent contributes.\n\nParent 1 is CC BB. They can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb. They can only contribute c and b.\n\nWhen forming the F1, each parent produces gametes CB and cb. The F1 is CcBb. Now, when F1 selfs (F2), the possible gametes are CB and cb. The probabilities are:\n\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (cb + cb)\n\nWait, but this seems off because the actual F2 should have four phenotypic categories, each with specific probabilities. Let me recast it properly. The F2 will consist of four phenotypic categories, each dependent on the combination of the two genes. Since the two genes are independent, the number of phenotypic classes is 2 x 2 = 4, each corresponding to a combination of dominant and recessive traits. The probabilities for each class are calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of being dominant (for pigment) is 1 (since both parents are C/C, so all F2 have C). The probability of being recessive is 0. For the B gene, the same applies\u2014if both parents are B/B, all F2 have B. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits expressed\u2014so all phenotypes will be the combination of both dominant traits. This would imply that all F2 birds will have both pigment red and brown, regardless of the genotype. But that contradicts the given answer choices, which suggest varying phenotypic ratios. Perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the genes are acting independently, and each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. However, since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 could potentially have different combinations. Wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would consist of four phenotypic classes based on the combinations of the two genes. Each gene has two possible states, so the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1 if all combinations are equally likely. But according to the options provided, none seem to indicate equal distribution. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, hold on. The first parent is CC BB. It's homozygous for both genes, so any F2 bird will inherit either C or B from this parent. The second parent is cc bb, so any F2 bird will inherit either c or b from this parent. Therefore, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from C and c)\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- cc (from c and c)\n- BB (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nBut considering the inheritance from both parents, each gene is inherited separately. So for the C gene: Parent 1 contributes C, Parent 2 contributes c. So F2 for C is Cc. Similarly, for B: Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So F2 for B is Bb. Therefore, F2 genotypes are all CcBb, except when mixing alleles differently. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene, so F2 for C is Cc (from C and c), and for B is Bb (from B and b). Therefore, the F2 population consists of four possible combinations of Cc and Bb:\n\n1. CC (from C and c)\n2. Cc (from C and c)\n3. cc (from c and c)\n4. BB (from B and b)\n5. Bb (from B and b)\n6. bb (from b and b)\n\nHowever, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering each gene separately and then combining them. For each gene:\n\n- For C: 50% C (pigment red) and 50% c (plain)\n- For B: 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince the two genes determine different traits, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Since each gene is independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait in that phenotype. \n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability C = 1 (since both parents are C)\n   - Probability B = 1 (both parents are B)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype exists always.\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b):\n   - Probability C = 1\n   - Probability b = 0 (since both parents are B/B)\n   - Combined probability = 1 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\n3. Plain and brown (c and B):\n   - Probability c = 0\n   - Probability B = 1\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b):\n   - Probability c = 0\n   - Probability b = 0 (since both parents are B/B)\n   - Combined probability = 0 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Phenotype never observed.\n\nWait, this can't be right because all F2 individuals would have at least pigment red and brown, making all phenotypes existent. But according to the answer choices, none of them show such a straightforward ratio. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something about the inheritance.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygous for each gene. In this case, the first parent is CC BB, which means both genes are homozygous. The second parent is cc bb, also homozygous. So when crossed, the F1 will be CcBb, but when F1 selfs, the F2 will be:\n\nEach gene in F2 comes from one allele from each parent. For C, F1 has C and c, so F2 Cc. For B, F1 has B and b, so F2 Bb. Therefore, F2 genotypes are all CcBb, but the possible gametes are CB and cb. Thus, the F2 phenotypes depend on whether each parent contributes C or c and B or b. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (but wait, no\u2014because F2 Cc can combine with F2 Bb to give different combinations. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's use a Punnett square approach.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Itself, F1 produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (50% each). When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/2 CcBb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered\n- cc bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but the F2 population isn't all the same because the parents are homozygous. So the possible F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are 1:2:1 for the four possible phenotypes? No, because there are only three phenotypes, depending on whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): All individuals with CC or Cc and BB or Bb will have both traits expressed. So Phenotype 1: Red Brown (25%)\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs in individuals where C is present and b is absent. Looking at the F2 genotypes, only those with cc bb (i.e., cc) will have b. But wait, in the F2, the cc bb is 25%, but in terms of phenotype, it's Plain Checkered (phenotype 3).\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs in individuals where c is absent and B is present. So any C present will allow for brown. So Phenotype 2: Red Brown?\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 Occurs in CC BB (25%) and CcBb (50%), so total 75%.\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b recessive) \u2192 Only occurs in CcBb individuals where b is present. Wait, no\u2014CcBb includes both C and b, but in reality, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So any C present will mean pigment red, and any b present will mean checkered. Therefore, Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b) occurs in all CcBb individuals, which is 50% of the F2. But wait, no\u2014because in CcBb, the presence of C makes it Pigment red, and presence of b makes it Checkered. So all CcBb individuals will have both traits, hence Phenotype 1. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that all F2 individuals have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). Therefore, they will all exhibit both traits, meaning the phenotypic ratio is 100%, but that conflicts with the answer choices. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the F2 phenotypic ratios based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Since each gene has two possible alleles (dominant and recessive), the possible phenotypic categories are four: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The probabilities for each are as follows:\n\n- Red-Brown: 25% (all individuals)\n- Red-Checkered: 0% (since if C is present, B must be present)\n- Plain-Brown: 25% (all individuals)\n- Plain-Checkered: 0% (since if B is present, it must be brown)\n\nThis would result in a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0. But none of the answer choices match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about how the F2 generations manifest.\n\nWait, maybe the F2 individuals don't all express both traits. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for each gene, but instead, the F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the F2 may include a mix of Cc and Bb, leading to partial expression. However, that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 without considering the F1's contributions beyond the initial cross. Let's assume that the F2 is derived solely from the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. When crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 genotypes are as previously discussed: 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, 25% cc bb.\n\nNow, applying Mendelian rules, each gene segregates independently. For the C locus: 50% C and 50% c. For the B locus: 50% B and 50% b. The phenotypes are determined by the combination of these. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios are determined by the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the two genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1 for each possible combination. But since all F2 individuals inherit at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for color (B), all will express both traits, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:0:1:0.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is not all CcBb, but rather includes some Cc and Bb alleles from the F1, leading to different F2 genotypes. Let me re-examine the F1 cross.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CcBb x CcBb, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Each has a 25% chance.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are as above. Now, applying the phenotypic rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 dominant traits, so Phenotype 1: 25% (from CC BB)\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 25% (from CC Bb) + 25% (from Cc BB) + 25% (from Cc Bb) = 75%?\nWait, no. Each genotype has its own phenotype based on the combination of C and B. Wait, let me correct this.\n\nFor each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 2/4 (50%)\n- Phenotype 3: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3/4 (75%)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent because each F2 individual's phenotype depends on both genes, so the overall count should sum appropriately. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype 1 (1/4)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype 2 (1/4)\n- CC bb: Phenotype 2 (1/4)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n- cc bb: Phenotype 3 (1/4)\n\nAdding up the Pheno 2 instances: CC Bb (1/4) + CC bb (1/4) = 2/4 \u2192 Phenotype 2: 2/4\nPheno 1: 1/4\nPheno 3: remaining 3/4 (since 1+2=3, 9-3=6; but wait, 9 total F2 individuals: 1 Phenotype 1, 2 Phenotype 2, 6 Phenotype 3. Wait, no\u2014there are nine F2 individuals, each contributing to the next generation. Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, the correct way is to see that:\n\n- Phenotype 1 occurs in 1/4 of the F2 (from CC BB)\n- Phenotype 2 occurs in 2/4 (from CC Bb and CC bb)\n- Phenotype 3 occurs in 2/4 (from Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered) occurs in 2/4 (from cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\nWait, no\u2014looking back, I've miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait.",
    "rollout": " If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, it'll have neither. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 checkered bird (assuming both are dominant)\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The options are about the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the problem is that the checkered bird refers to the phenotype where both C and B are recessive (i.e., both genes are in the recessive state), resulting in a bird that looks like a plain red with a checkered pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the pattern of color, regardless of the actual pigment. Hmm, the original description says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, while \"plain\" refers to the color. So, the phenotype could be either checkered (plain color) or plain (red or brown). So the possible phenotypes are: \n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B are recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (only B is recessive, C is dominant)\n3. Plain red (only C is recessive, B is dominant)\n4. Plain brown (neither C nor B is dominant)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red\n- Checkered brown\n- Plain red\n- Plain brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation is produced by crossing F1 (which was CcBb) with itself. So each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since the parents were homozygous, the gametes would be CB and cb each at 50% frequency. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will then express the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, B dominant): Pigment red, brown \u2192 checkered bird (but according to the options, perhaps this is considered as plain red or something else?)\nWait, no\u2014according to the problem statement, \"plain\" refers to the color, not the pattern. So \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color. So in terms of phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are recessive\n- Checkered brown: Only B is recessive\n- Plain red: Only C is recessive\n- Plain brown: Neither C nor B is dominant\n\nSo, looking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered bird with both traits expressed \u2192 Checkered red (since both are dominant)\n- Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered bird with pigment red, no brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain bird without red or brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb: Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because C and B are separate traits. So a bird with CC will have both traits (red and brown), making it a checkered bird with both traits expressed. A bird with Cc will have pigment red but no brown, making it a checkered bird with red. Similarly, a bird with cc will have neither red nor brown, making it plain. And a bird with bb will also have neither, making it plain.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by c (recessive), and the color is determined by B (dominant). So a bird with cc will have no red and no brown, hence plain. A bird with Cc will have red but no brown, hence checkered red. A bird with cc will have no red and no brown, hence plain. A bird with CcBb will have both traits expressed, hence checkered red. So, in the F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when either C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), or C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b). So, the genotypes CC and Cc will lead to checkered red. Similarly, the genotypes cc and Cc will lead to plain. Wait, no\u2014because if B is recessive (b), then the bird has brown but not red, so it's checkered brown. If B is dominant (B), it's red but not brown, so checkered red. If both are recessive (cc), it's plain. If both are dominant (CC), it's checkered red with both traits.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (at least one C) and B is dominant (at least one B), the bird has both traits \u2192 Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive (no B), the bird has red but no brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n- If C is recessive (no C) and B is dominant, the bird has brown but no red \u2192 Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive, the bird has neither \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B dominant (either CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain red: C recessive, B dominant (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: C recessive, B recessive (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's count how many of each in F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Each F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes, so F2 is 16 (4\u00d74).\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the options don't seem to align perfectly. Let's look at the answer choices again. They are labeled from A to J, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. The options include things like checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. So I need to compute the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nAssuming the F2 has 16 individuals, let's distribute them:\n\n- CC: 4 individuals (25%)\n- Cc: 8 individuals (50%)\n- cc: 4 individuals (25%)\n- bb: 4 individuals (25%)\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- cc: Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- bb: Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4) + Cc (8) = 12\n- Checkered brown: cc (4) = 4\n- Plain brown: bb (4) = 4\n- Plain red: None, since no C dominant\n\nWait, but none of the options have plain red. All options mention checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the classification. If a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it's Checkered red. If C recessive and B dominant, it's Checkered brown. If both are recessive, it's Plain brown. If both are dominant, it's Checkered red. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4) + Cc (8) = 12\n- Checkered brown: cc (4)\n- Plain brown: bb (4)\n- Plain red: 0\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Not matching. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No. Option B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No. Option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. No. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I misinterpret the phenotypes?\n\nWait, maybe the checkered pattern refers to the color being absent (plain), not the presence of the color. So the checkered pattern would mean that the bird does not have the color, i.e., it's plain. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Plain (both C and B recessive)\n- Checkered red (only C recessive, B dominant)\n- Checkered brown (only B recessive, C dominant)\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNo, that still wouldn't change the numbers much. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, regardless of the color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Checkered pattern but red color \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: Checkered pattern but brown color \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Checkered pattern but no color \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: Checkered pattern but brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThat interpretation seems less likely because the problem explicitly mentions that the checkered pattern is due to c (recessive), implying that the bird lacks the color. So perhaps the terminology needs to be adjusted. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color, meaning that the bird has no pigment (plain) but the pattern is visible. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: No color (plain) but red pigment \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: No color (plain) but brown pigment \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: No color (plain) but red pigment \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: No color (plain) but brown pigment \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C recessive and B dominant\n- Checkered brown: C dominant and B recessive\n- Plain red: C recessive and B recessive\n- Plain brown: C dominant and B recessive\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the bird has the checkered pattern (no color), then it has neither pigment (plain). But the color (red or brown) may or may not be present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (so C is recessive), but red pigment (so B is dominant)\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present, but brown pigment (so B recessive)\n- Plain red: Pattern present, but no red pigment (so C and B recessive)\n- Plain brown: Pattern present, but brown pigment (so C dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the pattern is present (checkered) and the color present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B dominant)\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present, color brown (B recessive)\n- Plain red: Pattern present, no color (both C and B recessive)\n- Plain brown: Pattern present, brown color (C dominant, B recessive)\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes would translate to:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain red: CC (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain brown: Cc (wait, no\u2014plain brown would require C dominant, B recessive, which is Cc.)\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that Cc would have both traits unless one is missing. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it has red but no brown, so it's Checkered red. Similarly, C dominant and B dominant is Checkered red, and C recessive and B dominant is plain brown. C recessive and B recessive is plain red.\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain red: CC (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n\nNow, the F2 will have:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25% of F2)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50%)\n- Plain red: cc (25%)\n- Plain brown: Cc (50%) \u2192 Wait, no, because Cc is already counted under Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the F2, the Cc genotype includes both Checkered red and Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014C dominant and B dominant is Checkered red. C dominant and B recessive is Checkered brown. C recessive and B dominant is plain brown. C recessive and B recessive is plain red. So in F2:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered red and Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown and plain red\n- Cc: Again, same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n   - C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc (25%): Checkered brown? No, wait\u2014cc is plain brown (no pigment). Because B is recessive, so brown is not expressed.\n   Wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird is cc, it cannot express the coat color (as B is recessive). So cc is plain brown. Similarly, Cc would be either Checkered red or Checkered brown depending on B.\n\nWait, no\u2014hold on. The phenotype depends on both traits. So:\n\n- For C dominant (C_), and B dominant (B_), the bird has both traits \u2192 Checkered red\n- For C dominant (C_), and B recessive (b_), the bird has red but no brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- For C recessive (cc), and B dominant (B_), the bird has brown but no red \u2192 Checkered brown\n- For C recessive (cc), and B recessive (bb), the bird has neither \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Checkered red and Checkered brown (because Cc can be either)\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown and plain brown (because cc has B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown, and cc has C recessive \u2192 plain brown)\n- Also, Cc has C dominant and B recessive, leading to Checkered brown\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me approach it differently. For each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (both traits present)\n- Cc: Either Checkered red (if B dominant) or Checkered brown (if B recessive)\n- cc: Checkered brown (if B dominant) or plain brown (if B recessive)\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) = 75%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50%) + cc (25%) = 75%\n- Plain brown: cc (25%) \n- Plain red: 0\n\nBut according to the options, none have plain red. So perhaps the question's definition of phenotypes is different. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, regardless of color, and \"plain\" refers to colorless. So:\n\n- Checkered pattern (pattern present, color absent) \u2192 Checkered red and plain red?\nWait, no. The problem statement says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c\". So \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color, meaning the bird is plain. Therefore, the checkered pattern is the opposite of the actual color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present (C recessive), color brown (B recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: Pattern present (C recessive), color brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAh, now that makes sense. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C recessive (C_), B dominant (B_)\n- Checkered brown: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n- Plain red: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n- Plain brown: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n\nWait, no\u2014because B recessive leads to brown, so:\n\nWait, confusion arises.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If one is dominant and the other recessive, it'll have one trait. If both are recessive, it'll have neither. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and brown \u2192 checkered bird (assuming both are dominant)\n\nWait, but the options given are different. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The options are about the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the problem is that the checkered bird refers to the phenotype where both C and B are recessive (i.e., both genes are in the recessive state), resulting in a bird that looks like a plain red with a checkered pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the pattern of color, regardless of the actual pigment. Hmm, the original description says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, while \"plain\" refers to the color. So, the phenotype could be either checkered (plain color) or plain (red or brown). So the possible phenotypes are: \n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B are recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (only B is recessive, C is dominant)\n3. Plain red (only C is recessive, B is dominant)\n4. Plain brown (neither C nor B is dominant)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red\n- Checkered brown\n- Plain red\n- Plain brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation is produced by crossing F1 (which was CcBb) with itself. So each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since the parents were homozygous, the gametes would be CB and cb each at 50% frequency. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will then express the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, B dominant): Pigment red, brown \u2192 checkered bird (but according to the options, perhaps this is considered as plain red or something else?)\nWait, no\u2014according to the problem statement, \"plain\" refers to the color, not the pattern. So \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color. So in terms of phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B are recessive\n- Checkered brown: Only B is recessive\n- Plain red: Only C is recessive\n- Plain brown: Neither C nor B is dominant\n\nSo, looking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered bird with both traits expressed \u2192 Checkered red (since both are dominant)\n- Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered bird with pigment red, no brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc: Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain bird without red or brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb: Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because C and B are separate traits. So a bird with CC will have both traits (red and brown), making it a checkered bird with both traits expressed. A bird with Cc will have pigment red but no brown, making it a checkered bird with red. Similarly, a bird with cc will have neither red nor brown, making it plain. And a bird with bb will also have neither, making it plain.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by c (recessive), and the color is determined by B (dominant). So a bird with cc will have no red and no brown, hence plain. A bird with Cc will have red but no brown, hence checkered red. A bird with cc will have no red and no brown, hence plain. A bird with CcBb will have both traits expressed, hence checkered red. So, in the F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when either C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), or C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b). So, the genotypes CC and Cc will lead to checkered red. Similarly, the genotypes cc and Cc will lead to plain. Wait, no\u2014because if B is recessive (b), then the bird has brown but not red, so it's checkered brown. If B is dominant (B), it's red but not brown, so checkered red. If both are recessive (cc), it's plain. If both are dominant (CC), it's checkered red with both traits.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (at least one C) and B is dominant (at least one B), the bird has both traits \u2192 Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive (no B), the bird has red but no brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n- If C is recessive (no C) and B is dominant, the bird has brown but no red \u2192 Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive, the bird has neither \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B dominant (either CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain red: C recessive, B dominant (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: C recessive, B recessive (cc bb)\n\nNow, let's count how many of each in F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Each F1 (CcBb) produces four gametes, so F2 is 16 (4\u00d74).\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the options don't seem to align perfectly. Let's look at the answer choices again. They are labeled from A to J, each giving a specific phenotypic ratio. The options include things like checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc. So I need to compute the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nAssuming the F2 has 16 individuals, let's distribute them:\n\n- CC: 4 individuals (25%)\n- Cc: 8 individuals (50%)\n- cc: 4 individuals (25%)\n- bb: 4 individuals (25%)\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- Cc: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- cc: Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- bb: Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4) + Cc (8) = 12\n- Checkered brown: cc (4) = 4\n- Plain brown: bb (4) = 4\n- Plain red: None, since no C dominant\n\nWait, but none of the options have plain red. All options mention checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the classification. If a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it's Checkered red. If C recessive and B dominant, it's Checkered brown. If both are recessive, it's Plain brown. If both are dominant, it's Checkered red. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (4) + Cc (8) = 12\n- Checkered brown: cc (4)\n- Plain brown: bb (4)\n- Plain red: 0\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Not matching. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No. Option B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No. Option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. No. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Did I misinterpret the phenotypes?\n\nWait, maybe the checkered pattern refers to the color being absent (plain), not the presence of the color. So the checkered pattern would mean that the bird does not have the color, i.e., it's plain. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Plain (both C and B recessive)\n- Checkered red (only C recessive, B dominant)\n- Checkered brown (only B recessive, C dominant)\n- Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNo, that still wouldn't change the numbers much. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, regardless of the color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Checkered pattern but red color \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: Checkered pattern but brown color \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Checkered pattern but no color \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: Checkered pattern but brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThat interpretation seems less likely because the problem explicitly mentions that the checkered pattern is due to c (recessive), implying that the bird lacks the color. So perhaps the terminology needs to be adjusted. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color, meaning that the bird has no pigment (plain) but the pattern is visible. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: No color (plain) but red pigment \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: No color (plain) but brown pigment \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: No color (plain) but red pigment \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: No color (plain) but brown pigment \u2192 Plain brown\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C recessive and B dominant\n- Checkered brown: C dominant and B recessive\n- Plain red: C recessive and B recessive\n- Plain brown: C dominant and B recessive\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the bird has the checkered pattern (no color), then it has neither pigment (plain). But the color (red or brown) may or may not be present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (so C is recessive), but red pigment (so B is dominant)\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present, but brown pigment (so B recessive)\n- Plain red: Pattern present, but no red pigment (so C and B recessive)\n- Plain brown: Pattern present, but brown pigment (so C dominant, B recessive)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the pattern is present (checkered) and the color present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B dominant)\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present, color brown (B recessive)\n- Plain red: Pattern present, no color (both C and B recessive)\n- Plain brown: Pattern present, brown color (C dominant, B recessive)\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes would translate to:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain red: CC (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain brown: Cc (wait, no\u2014plain brown would require C dominant, B recessive, which is Cc.)\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that Cc would have both traits unless one is missing. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it has red but no brown, so it's Checkered red. Similarly, C dominant and B dominant is Checkered red, and C recessive and B dominant is plain brown. C recessive and B recessive is plain red.\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain red: CC (from F1 x F1)\n- Plain brown: Cc (from F1 x F1)\n\nNow, the F2 will have:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25% of F2)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50%)\n- Plain red: cc (25%)\n- Plain brown: Cc (50%) \u2192 Wait, no, because Cc is already counted under Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the F2, the Cc genotype includes both Checkered red and Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014C dominant and B dominant is Checkered red. C dominant and B recessive is Checkered brown. C recessive and B dominant is plain brown. C recessive and B recessive is plain red. So in F2:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered red and Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown and plain red\n- Cc: Again, same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%): Checkered red\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n   - C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc (25%): Checkered brown? No, wait\u2014cc is plain brown (no pigment). Because B is recessive, so brown is not expressed.\n   Wait, no\u2014wait, if a bird is cc, it cannot express the coat color (as B is recessive). So cc is plain brown. Similarly, Cc would be either Checkered red or Checkered brown depending on B.\n\nWait, no\u2014hold on. The phenotype depends on both traits. So:\n\n- For C dominant (C_), and B dominant (B_), the bird has both traits \u2192 Checkered red\n- For C dominant (C_), and B recessive (b_), the bird has red but no brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- For C recessive (cc), and B dominant (B_), the bird has brown but no red \u2192 Checkered brown\n- For C recessive (cc), and B recessive (bb), the bird has neither \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Checkered red and Checkered brown (because Cc can be either)\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown and plain brown (because cc has B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown, and cc has C recessive \u2192 plain brown)\n- Also, Cc has C dominant and B recessive, leading to Checkered brown\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me approach it differently. For each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (both traits present)\n- Cc: Either Checkered red (if B dominant) or Checkered brown (if B recessive)\n- cc: Checkered brown (if B dominant) or plain brown (if B recessive)\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) = 75%\n- Checkered brown: Cc (50%) + cc (25%) = 75%\n- Plain brown: cc (25%) \n- Plain red: 0\n\nBut according to the options, none have plain red. So perhaps the question's definition of phenotypes is different. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the pattern, regardless of color, and \"plain\" refers to colorless. So:\n\n- Checkered pattern (pattern present, color absent) \u2192 Checkered red and plain red?\nWait, no. The problem statement says \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c\". So \"checkered\" refers to the lack of color, meaning the bird is plain. Therefore, the checkered pattern is the opposite of the actual color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: Pattern present (C recessive), color brown (B recessive) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain red: Pattern present (C recessive), color red (B recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain brown: Pattern present (C recessive), color brown (B recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAh, now that makes sense. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C recessive (C_), B dominant (B_)\n- Checkered brown: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n- Plain red: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n- Plain brown: C recessive (C_), B recessive (b_)\n\nWait, no\u2014because B recessive leads to brown, so:\n\nWait, confusion arises.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So in this case, every bird will have pigment red and brown, making their phenotype \"red and brown.\" Similarly, if C is dominant and B is recessive, the phenotype is \"red and checkered,\" and so on.",
    "rollout": " So in this case, every bird will have pigment red and brown, making their phenotype \"red and brown.\" Similarly, if C is dominant and B is recessive, the phenotype is \"red and checkered,\" and so on.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options given, none of them have a phenotype where all birds have both traits. Let me re-examine the question. The options A through H list different phenotypic ratios. Looking at option D: 1, 3, 9, 3. Wait, that seems inconsistent with what I thought earlier. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the phenotypes are combined isn't just about having both traits. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- CC: pigment red\n- Cc: pigment red (since dominant)\n- cc: plain\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each bird are combinations of these traits. The phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, B recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): B dominant, C recessive\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): B recessive, C recessive\n\nNow, the question is, how often do these phenotypes occur in the F2 generation?\n\nSince the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 will be all CcBb (as discussed before). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. The number of each type of bird can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the alleles for each gene.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Probability of C (pigment red): 1 (since CC and Cc are both dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain): 0.5 (since only cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Probability of B (brown): 1 (since BB and Bb are dominant)\n- Probability of b (checkered): 0.5 (since only bb)\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene, assuming independence. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (1) * (1) = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (1) * (0.5) = 0.5\n3. Plain and brown: (0.5) * (1) = 0.5\n4. Plain and checkered: (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with typical Mendelian ratios because each bird's traits are determined by both genes. However, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for either gene leads to the corresponding trait. So the actual phenotypic ratios observed would be:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 100% occurrence (all birds have both traits)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 50% occurrence\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 50% occurrence\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 25% occurrence\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios adding up to 10, so likely showing the count of each phenotype among the F2 generation.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities correctly. Each gene is inherited independently, so:\n\nFor Gene C (C or cc):\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0.5\n\nFor Gene B (B or bb):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0.5\n\nSo the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's compute each phenotype's frequency:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C (1) * B (1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C (1) * b (0.5) = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n3. Plain and brown: c (0.5) * B (1) = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n4. Plain and checkered: c (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, these phenotypes don't add up to 100%, so I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations and sum their probabilities. Let me try that.\n\nTotal possible phenotypes are four:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nTheir probabilities are:\n\n1. 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled appropriately)\n2. 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nTo make them add up to 1, we scale them by dividing by the sum (1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25). So:\n\n1. 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.444\n2. 0.5 / 2.25 \u2248 0.222\n3. 0.5 / 2.25 \u2248 0.222\n4. 0.25 / 2.25 \u2248 0.111\n\nWait, but that still sums to approximately 1. So the phenotypic ratios would be roughly:\n\n1. ~44.4%\n2. ~22.2%\n3. ~22.2%\n4. ~11.1%\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly reflect this. Let me see which option matches. Option D says 1, 3, 9, 3. Summing those numbers gives 1+3+9+3=16, which is higher than 10. That can't be right because the sum should be 10. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio without scaling, treating each bird as contributing to the next generation regardless of phenotype. In that case, the F2 generation would consist of 16 birds (since F1 is 2, F2 is 4, but wait, actually F1 is 2 individuals, F2 is 4, but each bird producing 4 gametes would lead to 16 offspring, but with some phenotypes repeating.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. The F2 generation consists of 16 birds (since each F1 bird (2) produces 4 gametes, leading to 2 x 4 = 8, then F2 would be 4). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The F1 generation is 2 birds, F2 is 4 birds (each bird reproducing once, leading to 2 x 2 = 4). But each bird contributes 4 gametes, so the F2 would be 4 x 4 = 16 birds. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Each bird produces 4 gametes, and each gamete combines with each gamete from the other parent, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 offspring. But many of these offspring will have the same phenotype due to genetic consistency.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (pigs red and brown)\n- CC Bb: 25% (pigs red and checkered)\n- cc BB: 25% (plains and brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (plains and checkered)\n\nWait, but in reality, these percentages should be adjusted based on the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square to determine the exact F2 phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard Punnett square method for dihybrid crosses. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will be generated by crossing CcBb with itself. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% ratio. So the Punnett square will combine these:\n\n```\n     C c\n    B   |   B   |   c   |\n    -------------------\n   C | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n```\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The correct F2 grid would show all possible combinations. Each F1 gamete (CB, cb, cB, cb) combines with each F1 gamete:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cB = CC Bb (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (plain, plain)\n- cB + CB = CC Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cB + cB = cc BB (plain, brown)\n- cB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (plain, plain)\n\nWait, this seems messy. Let me create a table properly.\n\nThe F2 grid would have rows and columns representing the gametes:\n\n```\n       C c\n      B   |   B   |   c   |\n      ---------------------\n   C | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   b | Cc | Cc | Cc \n      B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n      c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n```\n\nWait, no, this isn't correct. Each row represents the F1 gamete from one parent, and each column from the other. The cells are the F2 genotypes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (parent1) + C (parent2) = CC\n2. C + c = Cc\n3. c + C = Cc\n4. c + c = cc\n\nSimilarly for B and b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pig red, brown\n- CC Bb: Pig red, brown\n- CC bb: Plain, brown\n- cc BB: Plain, brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, brown\n- cc bb: Plain, plain\n\nNext, let's calculate the proportion of each genotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square above, each cell represents a 25% chance. Let's tally them:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 4/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc Bb: 4/16\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\nSimplify:\n\n- 1/16: Pig red, brown\n- 4/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, brown\n- 4/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, plain\n\nAdding up the counts:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 part\n- Plain, brown: 4 parts\n- Plain, plain: 1 part\n\nTotal: 6 parts\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, Pig red, brown is 1/16, which is 1 part, and Plain, brown is 4/16, which is 4 parts, and Plain, plain is 1 part.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 part\n- Plain, brown: 4 parts\n- Plain, plain: 1 part\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so we need to translate these counts into ratios based on the number of each phenotype. The counts are:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1\n- Plain, brown: 4\n- Plain, plain: 1\n\nThis adds up to 6 units, but since the question lists the ratios as 6, 2, 6, 2, etc., perhaps the denominator is 6. Let me see:\n\nIf we divide each count by the greatest common divisor of 1, 4, 1, which is 1, the ratio remains 1:4:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to fit this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16 (sums to 16)\nOption B: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Same as A\nOption C: 6, 3, 2, 1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E: 7, 5, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nHmm, all the options except A and B have totals that aren't matching my calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the counts:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 (only CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Plain, brown: 4 (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb)\n- Plain, plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo the ratios are 1 : 4 : 1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at the answer options, Option B states 6, 2, 6, 2, which sums to 16. That doesn't match our 1:4:1 ratio. Option A is 6, 2, 6, 2, also sums to 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, but perhaps the counts are being expressed differently. Let me consider that each bird may contribute multiple offspring, but in reality, each bird in the F2 generation is a unique individual, so the counts remain as per the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, considering that each bird can produce different gametes. Let me reconsider the dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in cases where both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but depending on dominance. However, in this case, both traits are fully dominant, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9 (pig red and brown) + 3 (pig red and checkered) + 3 (plain and brown) + 1 (plain and checkered) = 16.\n\nBut in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the actual counts would be:\n\n- 9 birds with both traits (pig red and brown)\n- 3 birds with pig red and checkered\n- 3 birds with plain and brown\n- 1 bird with plain and checkered\n\nWhich adds up to 16 birds. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option A: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nWait, no\u2014option A says 6, 2, 6, 2, which adds up to 16. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B is 6, 2, 6, 2, same as A. Option C is 6, 3, 2, 1, which sums to 12. Option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which sums to 16. Option E is 7, 5, 3, 1, summing to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nNone of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking back, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype across all generations, not just the F2.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the F2 generation, so perhaps I should focus on the F2 counts. According to the Punnett square analysis, the F2 generation would have 16 birds, with the following phenotypes:\n\n- Pig red and brown: 1/16\n- Plain and brown: 4/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:4:1, which can be represented as 1, 4, 1. But none of the options match this. However, looking at the options, option A states 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. This",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So in this case, every bird will have pigment red and brown, making their phenotype \"red and brown.\" Similarly, if C is dominant and B is recessive, the phenotype is \"red and checkered,\" and so on.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options given, none of them have a phenotype where all birds have both traits. Let me re-examine the question. The options A through H list different phenotypic ratios. Looking at option D: 1, 3, 9, 3. Wait, that seems inconsistent with what I thought earlier. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the phenotypes are combined isn't just about having both traits. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- CC: pigment red\n- Cc: pigment red (since dominant)\n- cc: plain\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each bird are combinations of these traits. The phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Both dominant\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): C dominant, B recessive\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): B dominant, C recessive\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): B recessive, C recessive\n\nNow, the question is, how often do these phenotypes occur in the F2 generation?\n\nSince the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 will be all CcBb (as discussed before). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes. The number of each type of bird can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of the alleles for each gene.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Probability of C (pigment red): 1 (since CC and Cc are both dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain): 0.5 (since only cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Probability of B (brown): 1 (since BB and Bb are dominant)\n- Probability of b (checkered): 0.5 (since only bb)\n\nTherefore, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene, assuming independence. So:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (1) * (1) = 1 \u2192 All birds have both traits.\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (1) * (0.5) = 0.5\n3. Plain and brown: (0.5) * (1) = 0.5\n4. Plain and checkered: (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with typical Mendelian ratios because each bird's traits are determined by both genes. However, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for either gene leads to the corresponding trait. So the actual phenotypic ratios observed would be:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 100% occurrence (all birds have both traits)\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 50% occurrence\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown \u2192 50% occurrence\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 25% occurrence\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios adding up to 10, so likely showing the count of each phenotype among the F2 generation.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities correctly. Each gene is inherited independently, so:\n\nFor Gene C (C or cc):\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 1\n- Probability of c (plain) = 0.5\n\nFor Gene B (B or bb):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 0.5\n\nSo the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's compute each phenotype's frequency:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C (1) * B (1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C (1) * b (0.5) = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n3. Plain and brown: c (0.5) * B (1) = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n4. Plain and checkered: c (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, these phenotypes don't add up to 100%, so I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations and sum their probabilities. Let me try that.\n\nTotal possible phenotypes are four:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Plain and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nTheir probabilities are:\n\n1. 1 * 1 = 1 (but scaled appropriately)\n2. 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n3. 0.5 * 1 = 0.5\n4. 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nTo make them add up to 1, we scale them by dividing by the sum (1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25). So:\n\n1. 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.444\n2. 0.5 / 2.25 \u2248 0.222\n3. 0.5 / 2.25 \u2248 0.222\n4. 0.25 / 2.25 \u2248 0.111\n\nWait, but that still sums to approximately 1. So the phenotypic ratios would be roughly:\n\n1. ~44.4%\n2. ~22.2%\n3. ~22.2%\n4. ~11.1%\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly reflect this. Let me see which option matches. Option D says 1, 3, 9, 3. Summing those numbers gives 1+3+9+3=16, which is higher than 10. That can't be right because the sum should be 10. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio without scaling, treating each bird as contributing to the next generation regardless of phenotype. In that case, the F2 generation would consist of 16 birds (since F1 is 2, F2 is 4, but wait, actually F1 is 2 individuals, F2 is 4, but each bird producing 4 gametes would lead to 16 offspring, but with some phenotypes repeating.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. The F2 generation consists of 16 birds (since each F1 bird (2) produces 4 gametes, leading to 2 x 4 = 8, then F2 would be 4). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The F1 generation is 2 birds, F2 is 4 birds (each bird reproducing once, leading to 2 x 2 = 4). But each bird contributes 4 gametes, so the F2 would be 4 x 4 = 16 birds. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Each bird produces 4 gametes, and each gamete combines with each gamete from the other parent, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 offspring. But many of these offspring will have the same phenotype due to genetic consistency.\n\nLet me list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (pigs red and brown)\n- CC Bb: 25% (pigs red and checkered)\n- cc BB: 25% (plains and brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (plains and checkered)\n\nWait, but in reality, these percentages should be adjusted based on the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square to determine the exact F2 phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard Punnett square method for dihybrid crosses. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will be generated by crossing CcBb with itself. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% ratio. So the Punnett square will combine these:\n\n```\n     C c\n    B   |   B   |   c   |\n    -------------------\n   C | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n```\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The correct F2 grid would show all possible combinations. Each F1 gamete (CB, cb, cB, cb) combines with each F1 gamete:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cB = CC Bb (pig red, brown)\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (plain, plain)\n- cB + CB = CC Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cB + cB = cc BB (plain, brown)\n- cB + cb = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb (pig red, brown)\n- cb + cb = cc bb (plain, plain)\n\nWait, this seems messy. Let me create a table properly.\n\nThe F2 grid would have rows and columns representing the gametes:\n\n```\n       C c\n      B   |   B   |   c   |\n      ---------------------\n   C | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   b | Cc | Cc | Cc \n      B | Cc | Cc | Cc \n      c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n   c | Cc | Cc | Cc \n```\n\nWait, no, this isn't correct. Each row represents the F1 gamete from one parent, and each column from the other. The cells are the F2 genotypes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (parent1) + C (parent2) = CC\n2. C + c = Cc\n3. c + C = Cc\n4. c + c = cc\n\nSimilarly for B and b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Pig red, brown\n- CC Bb: Pig red, brown\n- CC bb: Plain, brown\n- cc BB: Plain, brown\n- cc Bb: Plain, brown\n- cc bb: Plain, plain\n\nNext, let's calculate the proportion of each genotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square above, each cell represents a 25% chance. Let's tally them:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 4/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc Bb: 4/16\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\nSimplify:\n\n- 1/16: Pig red, brown\n- 4/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, brown\n- 4/16: Plain, brown\n- 1/16: Plain, plain\n\nAdding up the counts:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 part\n- Plain, brown: 4 parts\n- Plain, plain: 1 part\n\nTotal: 6 parts\n\nWait, but according to the calculations, Pig red, brown is 1/16, which is 1 part, and Plain, brown is 4/16, which is 4 parts, and Plain, plain is 1 part.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 part\n- Plain, brown: 4 parts\n- Plain, plain: 1 part\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so we need to translate these counts into ratios based on the number of each phenotype. The counts are:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1\n- Plain, brown: 4\n- Plain, plain: 1\n\nThis adds up to 6 units, but since the question lists the ratios as 6, 2, 6, 2, etc., perhaps the denominator is 6. Let me see:\n\nIf we divide each count by the greatest common divisor of 1, 4, 1, which is 1, the ratio remains 1:4:1. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to fit this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16 (sums to 16)\nOption B: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Same as A\nOption C: 6, 3, 2, 1 \u2192 Total 12\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E: 7, 5, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Total 16\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nHmm, all the options except A and B have totals that aren't matching my calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the counts:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- Pig red, brown: 1 (only CC BB and CC Bb)\n- Plain, brown: 4 (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb)\n- Plain, plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo the ratios are 1 : 4 : 1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at the answer options, Option B states 6, 2, 6, 2, which sums to 16. That doesn't match our 1:4:1 ratio. Option A is 6, 2, 6, 2, also sums to 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, but perhaps the counts are being expressed differently. Let me consider that each bird may contribute multiple offspring, but in reality, each bird in the F2 generation is a unique individual, so the counts remain as per the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype, considering that each bird can produce different gametes. Let me reconsider the dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in cases where both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but depending on dominance. However, in this case, both traits are fully dominant, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9 (pig red and brown) + 3 (pig red and checkered) + 3 (plain and brown) + 1 (plain and checkered) = 16.\n\nBut in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the actual counts would be:\n\n- 9 birds with both traits (pig red and brown)\n- 3 birds with pig red and checkered\n- 3 birds with plain and brown\n- 1 bird with plain and checkered\n\nWhich adds up to 16 birds. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option A: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nWait, no\u2014option A says 6, 2, 6, 2, which adds up to 16. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B is 6, 2, 6, 2, same as A. Option C is 6, 3, 2, 1, which sums to 12. Option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which sums to 16. Option E is 7, 5, 3, 1, summing to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16.\n\nNone of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking back, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype across all generations, not just the F2.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the F2 generation, so perhaps I should focus on the F2 counts. According to the Punnett square analysis, the F2 generation would have 16 birds, with the following phenotypes:\n\n- Pig red and brown: 1/16\n- Plain and brown: 4/16\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:4:1, which can be represented as 1, 4, 1. But none of the options match this. However, looking at the options, option A states 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. This",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many birds have each combination.",
    "rollout": " So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many birds have each combination.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait, regardless of the other gene. So, for example, a bird with the genotype C_B_ will have both traits: red pigment and brown body. Similarly, a bird with c_bb will have plain pigment and checkered body. A bird with c_B_ will have plain pigment but brown body, and a bird with CC bb will have red pigment but checkered body.\n\nSo, given that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc bb)\n3. Plain and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (ccc bb)\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, for Pigment red and brown (C_B_):\n- Probability of C_: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of B_: 1 (since any B gives brown)\nThus, P(C_B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nNext, Pigment red and checkered (Cc bb):\n- Probability of C_: 1\n- Probability of bb: 1/4 (since the bird must receive two recessive alleles for the b gene)\nThus, P(Cc bb) = 1 * 1/4 = 1/4\n\nPlain and brown (c_B_):\n- Probability of c_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 1\nThus, P(c_B_) = 1/4 * 1 = 1/4\n\nPlain and checkered (cccc): Wait, no\u2014the bird's genotype would be c c and b b. Wait, the bird's genotype would be cc bb. So,\n- Probability of c_: 1/4\n- Probability of b_: 1/4\nThus, P(cccc) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities for each phenotype:\n- Pigment red and brown: 1 (all cases where C and B are present)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and brown: 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nTo get the actual counts, we can assume a large number of birds, say 16, to make calculation easier.\n\nTotal:\n- Pigment red and brown: 16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 4\n- Plain and brown: 4\n- Plain and checkered: 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 16 : 4 : 4 : 1, which simplifies to 16:4:4:1 or 4:1:1:0.25, but typically expressed as whole numbers, so 16:4:4:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption J says: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This seems off.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, but our calculation shows different.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,2,6 \u2192 No.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of the options exactly match my calculation. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the genes. The question states:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant C = red, recessive c = plain)\n- B: color (dominant B = brown, recessive b = checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The possible phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotype can be categorized into four possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype were calculated earlier as 1, 1/4, 1/4, and 1/16 respectively. Multiplying by 16 gives 16, 4, 4, 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Maybe the options are presented differently, such as checking instead of looking at the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me think again about the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be all possible gametes from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CcBb, it can produce gametes CB, cB, CB, and cb, but each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB (25%), cB (25%), CB (25%), cb (25%). Wait, but actually, the distribution is 25% CB, 25% cB, 25% CB, 25% cb. So combined, the gametes would be CB (50%), cB (25%), cb (25%). Because two of the four gametes are CB, and two are cB and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two gametes, so the F2 would have four types: CB, cB, CB, cb. So the probabilities are 25% CB, 25% cB, 25% CB, 25% cb. Thus, overall, 50% CB, 25% cB, 25% cb. Wait, but that seems incorrect. Let me recount: each parent can produce four types of gametes, but the F2 would have four types: CB, cB, CB, and cb. So the F2 phenotypically would have four combinations, each occurring 25%, 25%, 25%, and 25%? No\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so each gamete is half the genome. Therefore, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each with 25% probability. So the total F2 population would be four phenotypic classes, each with 25% frequency. But according to the dominance rules, each phenotype combines the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but if each gamete is equally likely, then the F2 would have four phenotypic classes, each with equal representation. But according to our earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratios are 16:4:4:1, which sums to 25. So each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But according to dominance, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1, similar to a dihybrid cross. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. In a dihybrid cross, when both genes are segregating independently, the F2 generation phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16. But in our case, due to dominance, each trait combines into a phenotype. Let me list the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered | cc bb\nPlain & Brown | CC bb, cB_\nPigment Red & Checkered | Cc bb\nPigment Red & Brown | CcB_\n\nWait, no. Let me approach this methodically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment Red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Cc bb\n3. Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 cc B_\n4. Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_\n  - Probability of C_: 1 (any C gives red)\n  - Probability of B_: 1 (any B gives brown)\n  - Total: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 is certain? That can't be right because in reality, not every bird will have both traits unless both genes are dominant.\n  \nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will exhibit both traits. If a bird lacks at least one dominant allele for either gene, it won\u2019t display that trait. So, in terms of the F2 generation:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\n- Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds with at least one C and one B will have this phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered (Cc bb)\n- Probability = P(C_) * P(bb) = 1 * (1/4) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (cc B_)\n- Probability = P(cc) * P(B_) = (1/4) * 1 = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (cc bb)\n- Probability = P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding these up: 1 (for C_B_) + 1/4 (for Cc bb) + 1/4 (for cc B_) + 1/16 (for cc bb) = 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 1.5625 \u2192 Which exceeds 1, indicating an error in the approach.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the probabilities. The correct way is to consider the probabilities without adding them directly. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n- Plain and Brown: CC bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Pigment Red and Brown: CcB_ \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 1/16 * 4 = 1/4, which is less than 1. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes. The probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent segregation of the two genes.\n\nLet me use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfing, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        c | Cc | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes would be CB, cB, CB, and cb. The Punnett square should reflect all possible combinations. Let me correct that:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cB, CB, or cb. So the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cB: Cc Bb (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc Bb (another 25%) \u2192 Wait, no, because the order matters. The F2 would have the following:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete, so the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB (parent1) + CB (parent2) \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (another 25%) \u2192 Total of 50%\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes two gametes, so the F2 would have four combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 1/4, except CB + cb and cB + cb both lead to Cc Bb, so together they account for 2/4 = 1/2. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 = 1/2\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n\nWait, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red and brown (same as above)\n- cc Bb: Plain and brown (phenotype 2)\n\nSo the F2 would have two phenotypic classes: Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1) and Plain and brown (phenotype 2).\n\nCalculating the frequencies:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB and Cc Bb \u2192 (1/4) + (1/2) = 3/4\n- Phenotype 2: cc Bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut wait, let's apply dominance:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Any C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Plain and brown: Any c and B \u2192 Phenotype 2\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown): (CC BB) + (Cc Bb) + (Cc Bb) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain and brown): (cc Bb) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Pigment red and checkered: (Cc bb) = 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: (cc bb) = 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's inconsistent with the previous calculation. Let me recast this properly.\n\nIn F2:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 includes CC BB, Cc Bb, and another Cc Bb (from CB + cb and cB + cb). So total probability is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nPhenotype 2: Plain and brown \u2192 only cc Bb, which is 1/4.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Cc bb. Probability is 1/4.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 cc bb. Probability is 1/16.\n\nWait, that makes the phenotypic ratio 16:4:4:1, which aligns with the initial calculation. So, the phenotypic ratio is 16:4:4:1, which simplifies to 4:1:1:0.25.\n\nHowever, looking back at the answer choices, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which would correspond to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, similar to a standard dihybrid cross. But our calculation shows 16:4:4:1, which doesn't match any of the options perfectly. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using Punnett squares for each trait separately and then combine them. Let's do that.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red (probability 3/4)\n- cc: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (probability 3/4)\n- bb: Checkered (probability 1/4)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese fractions represent the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To convert these to counts, let's assume a large number of birds, say 16:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3\n- Plain and brown: 3\n- Plain and checkered: 1\n\nThis matches option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Wait, no, because in our calculation, Pigment red and brown is 9, Pigment red and checkered is 3, Plain and brown is 3, Plain and checkered is 1.\n\nBut option E says:\n\n- checkered red 3\n- checkered brown 9\n- plain red 1\n- plain brown 3\n\nWhich corresponds to our calculation. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option E.\n</think>\nThe",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many birds have each combination.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective trait, regardless of the other gene. So, for example, a bird with the genotype C_B_ will have both traits: red pigment and brown body. Similarly, a bird with c_bb will have plain pigment and checkered body. A bird with c_B_ will have plain pigment but brown body, and a bird with CC bb will have red pigment but checkered body.\n\nSo, given that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc bb)\n3. Plain and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (ccc bb)\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, for Pigment red and brown (C_B_):\n- Probability of C_: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of B_: 1 (since any B gives brown)\nThus, P(C_B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nNext, Pigment red and checkered (Cc bb):\n- Probability of C_: 1\n- Probability of bb: 1/4 (since the bird must receive two recessive alleles for the b gene)\nThus, P(Cc bb) = 1 * 1/4 = 1/4\n\nPlain and brown (c_B_):\n- Probability of c_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 1\nThus, P(c_B_) = 1/4 * 1 = 1/4\n\nPlain and checkered (cccc): Wait, no\u2014the bird's genotype would be c c and b b. Wait, the bird's genotype would be cc bb. So,\n- Probability of c_: 1/4\n- Probability of b_: 1/4\nThus, P(cccc) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities for each phenotype:\n- Pigment red and brown: 1 (all cases where C and B are present)\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1/4\n- Plain and brown: 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nTo get the actual counts, we can assume a large number of birds, say 16, to make calculation easier.\n\nTotal:\n- Pigment red and brown: 16\n- Pigment red and checkered: 4\n- Plain and brown: 4\n- Plain and checkered: 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 16 : 4 : 4 : 1, which simplifies to 16:4:4:1 or 4:1:1:0.25, but typically expressed as whole numbers, so 16:4:4:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption J says: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This seems off.\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, but our calculation shows different.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,2,6 \u2192 No.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 No.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nNone of the options exactly match my calculation. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the genes. The question states:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant C = red, recessive c = plain)\n- B: color (dominant B = brown, recessive b = checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The possible phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotype can be categorized into four possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigment red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red and checkered\n3. c dominant, B dominant: Plain and brown\n4. c dominant, B recessive: Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype were calculated earlier as 1, 1/4, 1/4, and 1/16 respectively. Multiplying by 16 gives 16, 4, 4, 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Maybe the options are presented differently, such as checking instead of looking at the number of birds with each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me think again about the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be all possible gametes from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CcBb, it can produce gametes CB, cB, CB, and cb, but each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB or cb. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB (25%), cB (25%), CB (25%), cb (25%). Wait, but actually, the distribution is 25% CB, 25% cB, 25% CB, 25% cb. So combined, the gametes would be CB (50%), cB (25%), cb (25%). Because two of the four gametes are CB, and two are cB and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two gametes, so the F2 would have four types: CB, cB, CB, cb. So the probabilities are 25% CB, 25% cB, 25% CB, 25% cb. Thus, overall, 50% CB, 25% cB, 25% cb. Wait, but that seems incorrect. Let me recount: each parent can produce four types of gametes, but the F2 would have four types: CB, cB, CB, and cb. So the F2 phenotypically would have four combinations, each occurring 25%, 25%, 25%, and 25%? No\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so each gamete is half the genome. Therefore, the F2 would have four types of gametes, each with 25% probability. So the total F2 population would be four phenotypic classes, each with 25% frequency. But according to the dominance rules, each phenotype combines the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but if each gamete is equally likely, then the F2 would have four phenotypic classes, each with equal representation. But according to our earlier calculation, the phenotypic ratios are 16:4:4:1, which sums to 25. So each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But according to dominance, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1, similar to a dihybrid cross. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. In a dihybrid cross, when both genes are segregating independently, the F2 generation phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which adds up to 16. But in our case, due to dominance, each trait combines into a phenotype. Let me list the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered | cc bb\nPlain & Brown | CC bb, cB_\nPigment Red & Checkered | Cc bb\nPigment Red & Brown | CcB_\n\nWait, no. Let me approach this methodically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the possible phenotypes are combinations of the two traits:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C_), Brown (B_) \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment Red (C_), Checkered (bb) \u2192 Cc bb\n3. Plain (cc), Brown (B_) \u2192 cc B_\n4. Plain (cc), Checkered (bb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_\n  - Probability of C_: 1 (any C gives red)\n  - Probability of B_: 1 (any B gives brown)\n  - Total: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Phenotype 1 is certain? That can't be right because in reality, not every bird will have both traits unless both genes are dominant.\n  \nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Because the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will exhibit both traits. If a bird lacks at least one dominant allele for either gene, it won\u2019t display that trait. So, in terms of the F2 generation:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown (C_B_)\n- Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds with at least one C and one B will have this phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered (Cc bb)\n- Probability = P(C_) * P(bb) = 1 * (1/4) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (cc B_)\n- Probability = P(cc) * P(B_) = (1/4) * 1 = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (cc bb)\n- Probability = P(cc) * P(bb) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, adding these up: 1 (for C_B_) + 1/4 (for Cc bb) + 1/4 (for cc B_) + 1/16 (for cc bb) = 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 1.5625 \u2192 Which exceeds 1, indicating an error in the approach.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the probabilities. The correct way is to consider the probabilities without adding them directly. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n- Plain and Brown: CC bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Pigment Red and Brown: CcB_ \u2192 Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 1/16 * 4 = 1/4, which is less than 1. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes. The probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the independent segregation of the two genes.\n\nLet me use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfing, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | C | c\n----------|---|---\n        C | CC | Cc\n----------|---|---\n        c | Cc | cc\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes would be CB, cB, CB, and cb. The Punnett square should reflect all possible combinations. Let me correct that:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cB, CB, or cb. So the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cB: Cc Bb (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc Bb (another 25%) \u2192 Wait, no, because the order matters. The F2 would have the following:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete, so the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB (parent1) + CB (parent2) \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (another 25%) \u2192 Total of 50%\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes two gametes, so the F2 would have four combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 1/4, except CB + cb and cB + cb both lead to Cc Bb, so together they account for 2/4 = 1/2. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 = 1/2\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n\nWait, but the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red and brown (same as above)\n- cc Bb: Plain and brown (phenotype 2)\n\nSo the F2 would have two phenotypic classes: Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1) and Plain and brown (phenotype 2).\n\nCalculating the frequencies:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC BB and Cc Bb \u2192 (1/4) + (1/2) = 3/4\n- Phenotype 2: cc Bb \u2192 1/4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut wait, let's apply dominance:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Any C and B \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Plain and brown: Any c and B \u2192 Phenotype 2\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown): (CC BB) + (Cc Bb) + (Cc Bb) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain and brown): (cc Bb) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Pigment red and checkered: (Cc bb) = 1/4\n- Plain and checkered: (cc bb) = 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's inconsistent with the previous calculation. Let me recast this properly.\n\nIn F2:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 includes CC BB, Cc Bb, and another Cc Bb (from CB + cb and cB + cb). So total probability is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nPhenotype 2: Plain and brown \u2192 only cc Bb, which is 1/4.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Cc bb. Probability is 1/4.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered \u2192 cc bb. Probability is 1/16.\n\nWait, that makes the phenotypic ratio 16:4:4:1, which aligns with the initial calculation. So, the phenotypic ratio is 16:4:4:1, which simplifies to 4:1:1:0.25.\n\nHowever, looking back at the answer choices, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which would correspond to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, similar to a standard dihybrid cross. But our calculation shows 16:4:4:1, which doesn't match any of the options perfectly. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using Punnett squares for each trait separately and then combine them. Let's do that.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C_: Pigment red (probability 3/4)\n- cc: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (probability 3/4)\n- bb: Checkered (probability 1/4)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese fractions represent the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. To convert these to counts, let's assume a large number of birds, say 16:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3\n- Plain and brown: 3\n- Plain and checkered: 1\n\nThis matches option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Wait, no, because in our calculation, Pigment red and brown is 9, Pigment red and checkered is 3, Plain and brown is 3, Plain and checkered is 1.\n\nBut option E says:\n\n- checkered red 3\n- checkered brown 9\n- plain red 1\n- plain brown 3\n\nWhich corresponds to our calculation. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option E.\n</think>\nThe",

    "chunk_removed": "If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But in reality, a bird could have one dominant and one recessive, leading to different phenotypes.",
    "rollout": " But in reality, a bird could have one dominant and one recessive, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014let's clarify: A bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these depends on the alleles present. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have both traits, so Phenotype 1 is 100%.\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses those traits. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles (either C or c for pigment, either B or b for color) leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 100%\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 ?\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 ?\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit the corresponding trait. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C or c), it'll express red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B or b), it'll express brown. So the phenotypes are determined by which genes are dominant.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be based on how often each combination occurs. Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but wait, adding up probabilities: 1+0.5+0.5+0.25=2.25, which doesn't add up to 1. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see\u2014I forgot to account for all possible combinations properly. Wait, no\u2014each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to show the respective trait. So the actual phenotypic ratio should consider the probabilities where each gene contributes to the trait.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (pigment plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (body brown)\n- Bb (body brown)\n- bb (body checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each gene is dominant or not.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, but that still seems messy. Instead, let's think in terms of the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or color (B), it expresses that trait. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is contributing to a trait.\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only color dominant)\n3. Plain and brown (only pigment dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (neither dominant)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Any bird that has at least one C or at least one B. Which is almost all except the genotype where both are cc and bb? Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, no\u2014a bird will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) if it's not cc, and at least one dominant allele for color (B) if it's not bb. So the only bird that won't have either trait is the genotype cc bb. So the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment is 1 - P(cc) = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 0.75. Similarly, for color, it's 1 - P(bb) = 0.75. But since the two events are independent, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment OR at least one dominant allele for color is 1 - P(neither). Wait, no\u2014actually, the phenotypic expression occurs regardless of the other gene. So, the probability of expressing both traits is 1, while the others vary based on which gene is missing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of birds that will have each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C: 3 possibilities (CC, Cc, cc)\nFor B: 3 possibilities (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo total possible combinations: 3 x 3 = 9. But in reality, for dihybrids, it's 3^2=9. But wait, in the context of dihybrid crosses, the actual F2 generation would come from the Punnett square, which for two independent genes would have 9 possible combinations. However, our parent genotypes are CcBb and ccbB, which may complicate things. Alternatively, focusing back on the F2 generation:\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. They self to produce F2. Each gene segregates independently, so each gene has a 25% chance for each allele.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the probability of having a specific combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nTo find the phenotype probabilities, we need to consider the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo, for each bird, we can represent their genotype as a pair (C, B):\n\n- (CC, BB): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (CC, Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (CC, bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- (Cc, BB): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (Cc, Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (Cc, bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- (cc, BB): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (cc, Bb): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (cc, bb): Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 (CC BB), 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 Total 4\nPhenotype 2: 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb) \u2192 Total 2\nPhenotype 3: 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 Total 2\nPhenotype 4: 9 (cc bb) \u2192 Total 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 possible combinations.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 2\nPhenotype 3: 2\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nTo get the ratio, we divide each by the total (9):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4/9 \u2248 0.444\n- Phenotype 2: 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9 \u2248 0.111\n\nBut none of the answer options match these fractions exactly. Let me look back at the options given.\n\nOptions A through H provide certain ratios, such as option D being \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, according to my calculation, the counts are 4, 2, 2, 1, which would translate to ratios of 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, dividing each by 1, it remains 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match mine.\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption B says checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 2\nPhenotype 3: 2\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Wait, perhaps the F2 refers to a different generation than what I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the question mentions adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, the F1 is created, followed by a dihybrid cross (F1 x F1), resulting in F2. However, the options don't include 4:2:2:1, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation after producing gametes from a different source. Wait, no\u2014the F2 comes directly from F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is incorrect. Let me reconsider the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (as each parent provides one allele).\n\nThen, F1 x F1: Each F1 bird is CcBb, so the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb (equal probabilities). Thus, the F2 would be:\n\nFor C locus: [C, C, c, c] \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: [B, B, b, b] \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes would be all possible combinations of C and B alleles. But looking at the options, the answers relate to phenotypic ratios, not genotypic ones.\n\nSo, going back, the phenotypic ratios for F2 would be based on the probabilities I calculated earlier: 4:2:2:1. But none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16, which is higher than 9, so probably not.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, also not 9.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 25, way too high.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Sum 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Sum 16.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 16.\n\nNone of them match 4:2:2:1. Did I misinterpret the question?\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between two different genotypes. The question states: \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, then F1 x F1 would yield F2. So, the F2 is derived from the dihybrid cross of CC BB and cc bb. However, the parents in the dihybrid cross are different from the original question. Wait, no\u2014the original question was about the F2 generation, so perhaps the dihybrid cross is part of creating the F2, making the parents for the cross CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the dihybrid cross involves two parents, each being CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because both parents can only produce gametes with the same alleles. So, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but that would result in F1 being CcBb, and F2 being as calculated before.\n\nBut again, the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between two different genotypes, but the question isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but that's impossible because both parents cannot contribute the same gametes. CC BB can only contribute CB, and cc bb can only contribute cb. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the dihybrid cross would involve F1 x F1, which we've already calculated.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that none of the options match 4:2:2:1, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nCalculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes and their frequencies.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can only produce gametes CB and cb, respectively, each at a frequency of 50%.\n\nWhen these F1 (CcBb) breed, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combine these to get the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25%: CC BB\n- 25%: CC Bb\n- 25%: CC bb\n- 25%: Cc BB\n- 25%: Cc Bb\n- 25%: Cc bb\n- 25%: cc BB\n- 25%: cc Bb\n- 25%: cc bb\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. But in reality, a bird could have one dominant and one recessive, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014let's clarify: A bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So for pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these depends on the alleles present. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype's probability:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds will have both traits, so Phenotype 1 is 100%.\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it expresses those traits. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles (either C or c for pigment, either B or b for color) leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 100%\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 ?\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 ?\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to exhibit the corresponding trait. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C or c), it'll express red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B or b), it'll express brown. So the phenotypes are determined by which genes are dominant.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be based on how often each combination occurs. Since each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant \u2192 P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 P(C) * P(b) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 P(c) * P(B) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 P(c) * P(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but wait, adding up probabilities: 1+0.5+0.5+0.25=2.25, which doesn't add up to 1. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see\u2014I forgot to account for all possible combinations properly. Wait, no\u2014each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to show the respective trait. So the actual phenotypic ratio should consider the probabilities where each gene contributes to the trait.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nPossible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (pigment plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (body brown)\n- Bb (body brown)\n- bb (body checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether each gene is dominant or not.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n9. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, but that still seems messy. Instead, let's think in terms of the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) or color (B), it expresses that trait. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is contributing to a trait.\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (only color dominant)\n3. Plain and brown (only pigment dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (neither dominant)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that lead to that phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Any bird that has at least one C or at least one B. Which is almost all except the genotype where both are cc and bb? Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, no\u2014a bird will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) if it's not cc, and at least one dominant allele for color (B) if it's not bb. So the only bird that won't have either trait is the genotype cc bb. So the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment is 1 - P(cc) = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 0.75. Similarly, for color, it's 1 - P(bb) = 0.75. But since the two events are independent, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment OR at least one dominant allele for color is 1 - P(neither). Wait, no\u2014actually, the phenotypic expression occurs regardless of the other gene. So, the probability of expressing both traits is 1, while the others vary based on which gene is missing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of birds that will have each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C: 3 possibilities (CC, Cc, cc)\nFor B: 3 possibilities (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo total possible combinations: 3 x 3 = 9. But in reality, for dihybrids, it's 3^2=9. But wait, in the context of dihybrid crosses, the actual F2 generation would come from the Punnett square, which for two independent genes would have 9 possible combinations. However, our parent genotypes are CcBb and ccbB, which may complicate things. Alternatively, focusing back on the F2 generation:\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. They self to produce F2. Each gene segregates independently, so each gene has a 25% chance for each allele.\n\nSo for the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the probability of having a specific combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nTo find the phenotype probabilities, we need to consider the presence of dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo, for each bird, we can represent their genotype as a pair (C, B):\n\n- (CC, BB): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (CC, Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (CC, bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- (Cc, BB): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (Cc, Bb): Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (Cc, bb): Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- (cc, BB): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (cc, Bb): Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- (cc, bb): Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 (CC BB), 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 Total 4\nPhenotype 2: 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb) \u2192 Total 2\nPhenotype 3: 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 Total 2\nPhenotype 4: 9 (cc bb) \u2192 Total 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 possible combinations.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 2\nPhenotype 3: 2\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nTo get the ratio, we divide each by the total (9):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4/9 \u2248 0.444\n- Phenotype 2: 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9 \u2248 0.222\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9 \u2248 0.111\n\nBut none of the answer options match these fractions exactly. Let me look back at the options given.\n\nOptions A through H provide certain ratios, such as option D being \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, according to my calculation, the counts are 4, 2, 2, 1, which would translate to ratios of 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, dividing each by 1, it remains 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match mine.\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption B says checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match my calculation of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 2\nPhenotype 3: 2\nPhenotype 4: 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Wait, perhaps the F2 refers to a different generation than what I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the question mentions adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, the F1 is created, followed by a dihybrid cross (F1 x F1), resulting in F2. However, the options don't include 4:2:2:1, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation after producing gametes from a different source. Wait, no\u2014the F2 comes directly from F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is incorrect. Let me reconsider the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (as each parent provides one allele).\n\nThen, F1 x F1: Each F1 bird is CcBb, so the gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb (equal probabilities). Thus, the F2 would be:\n\nFor C locus: [C, C, c, c] \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: [B, B, b, b] \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes would be all possible combinations of C and B alleles. But looking at the options, the answers relate to phenotypic ratios, not genotypic ones.\n\nSo, going back, the phenotypic ratios for F2 would be based on the probabilities I calculated earlier: 4:2:2:1. But none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16, which is higher than 9, so probably not.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, also not 9.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 25, way too high.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Sum 16.\n\nOption B: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Sum 16.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 16.\n\nNone of them match 4:2:2:1. Did I misinterpret the question?\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between two different genotypes. The question states: \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, then F1 x F1 would yield F2. So, the F2 is derived from the dihybrid cross of CC BB and cc bb. However, the parents in the dihybrid cross are different from the original question. Wait, no\u2014the original question was about the F2 generation, so perhaps the dihybrid cross is part of creating the F2, making the parents for the cross CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the dihybrid cross involves two parents, each being CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because both parents can only produce gametes with the same alleles. So, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but that would result in F1 being CcBb, and F2 being as calculated before.\n\nBut again, the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between two different genotypes, but the question isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the dihybrid cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but that's impossible because both parents cannot contribute the same gametes. CC BB can only contribute CB, and cc bb can only contribute cb. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the dihybrid cross would involve F1 x F1, which we've already calculated.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that none of the options match 4:2:2:1, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nCalculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gametes and their frequencies.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can only produce gametes CB and cb, respectively, each at a frequency of 50%.\n\nWhen these F1 (CcBb) breed, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combine these to get the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25%: CC BB\n- 25%: CC Bb\n- 25%: CC bb\n- 25%: Cc BB\n- 25%: Cc Bb\n- 25%: Cc bb\n- 25%: cc BB\n- 25%: cc Bb\n- 25%: cc bb\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 1",
