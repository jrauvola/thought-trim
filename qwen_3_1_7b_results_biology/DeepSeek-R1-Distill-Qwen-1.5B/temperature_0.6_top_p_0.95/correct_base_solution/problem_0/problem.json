  "problem": "The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.
