First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lysosome) makes sense because the lysosome would digest the vesicles afterward. However, option E also suggests breakdown, but that's more about cellular respiration.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis.

I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lysosome) is plausible because after engulfment, the vesicle often fuses with the lysosome. Option E might be a stretch, but breaking down itself isn't typical phagocytosis. Option H is also not standard. So, between D and F, which is more accurate? Since phagocytosis leads to engulfment and subsequent digestion, the most likely is D: fuses with the cell membrane. But wait, earlier reasoning thought D was incorrect because vesicles shouldn't stay inside. Hmm. Maybe I need to clarify: Phagocytosis results in the engulfment of an organelle, then it engulfs it, causing it to burst. So the vesicle fuses with the organelle, not the membrane. Therefore, none of the options explicitly state this. But looking back, option D says the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane. If that's the case, then the vesicle wouldn't contain the organelle anymore. Alternatively, perhaps option F is correct, where the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, releasing its contents. But the question asks what describes the fate, meaning what happens next. So if the vesicle engulfs the lysosome, it would cause the lysosome to burst, expelling the contents. But the options don't have \"fuses with lysosome\"; instead, F is the option. So maybe the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F, merging with the lysosome, makes sense because that's how phagocytosis leads to digestion. So the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Hmm, maybe the correct answer is D because it's about fusing with the membrane, even though it's not the usual outcome. Or perhaps I need to reconsider. If the question is about the fate, and phagocytosis results in the vesicle being released, then D could be correct. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F, but I'm a bit unsure. Since I have to choose one, I'll go with D because it accurately describes the fusion with the cell membrane.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lyso) makes sense, but wait\u2014phagocytosis does involve the lysosome, so the vesicle should fuse with it. But let me double-check: Normally, phagocytosis uses the lysosome as the next step, leading to vesicle fusing with the lysosome, releasing the contents, and then possibly digestion. So, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F about lysosome makes sense because that's what happens afterward. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Wait, phagocytosis involves engulfing an organelle, so the vesicle fuses with it, releasing its contents. So actually, option D might not be correct either. Hmm, now I'm confused. Maybe the correct answer is D because it says it fuses with the cell membrane, but according to my knowledge, the vesicle fuses with the organelle and then releases. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether it fuses with the membrane or goes elsewhere. Looking back, the question asks what describes the fate, so D says it fuses with the membrane, but I thought it would just release. Maybe I need to reconsider. Oh, perhaps the question is phrased differently. If the vesicle is engulfed by the lysosome, it would release the contents. But if it's engulfed by another organelle, it might fuse with it. Wait, the question says \"during phagocytosis,\" which is engulfment by an engulfed organelle. So after engulfment, the vesicle should release the contents into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the correct answer would be something about it being released, not fusing with the membrane. Looking at the options, J says it merges with a peroxisome, which I'm not sure about. But perhaps the correct answer is D, but I might have misread it earlier. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but that's about breaking down. No, I think the correct answer is D because it's released, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. To clarify, during phagocytosis, the engulfed organelle engulfs the vesicle, which then fuses with the organelle and releases its contents. So the fate would be that it fuses with the organelle, not necessarily the membrane. But among the options, none say it fuses with the organelle. Wait, option D is fusing with the membrane, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct answer is E, but that's about breaking down. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I must have made a mistake. Let me check again. Phagocytosis leads to the vesicle fusing with the engulfed organelle, not the membrane. So the correct answer can't be D. Then perhaps the correct answer is none of them, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether it's absorbed by ER, but phagocytosis doesn't involve ER. Perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but that's about breakdown, which doesn't fit. I think I'm stuck, but based on standard knowledge, phagocytosis results in the vesicle fusing with the engulfed organelle and expelling its contents. So among the options, there's no direct answer saying that. However, looking back, option D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Maybe that's incorrect because phagocytosis happens within the cytoplasm, so the vesicle shouldn't stay inside. Instead, it should release. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's about breakdown, which is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm unsure.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lysosome) makes sense, but wait, isn't the vesicle supposed to release from the lysosome? Or does it go into the cell? Wait, phagocytosis involves engulfing an organelle, so the vesicle fuses with it, releasing its contents. So actually, option D might not be correct either. Hmm, now I'm confused. Maybe the correct answer is D because it says it fuses with the cell membrane, but according to my knowledge, the vesicle fuses with the organelle and then releases. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether it fuses with the membrane or goes elsewhere. Looking back, the question asks what describes the fate, so D says it fuses with the membrane, but I thought it would just release. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lysosome) could happen but isn't the most likely. However, the key event is that the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, which is the direct result of phagocytosis. So the best answer is D, but wait, does phagocytosis involve the lysosome? Yes, because it engulfs it. So the correct fate is that the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, making D correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F, merging with lysosome, makes sense because lysosomes are responsible for degradation. So the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option E is wrong because phagocytosis doesn't cause breakdown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for this question about vesicle fates during phagocytosis. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that phagocytosis is when a engulfed organelle like a mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum engulfs a cell. Then, the engulfed cell gets engulfed by another organelle, usually the lysosome, which causes the cell to burst and expel its contents. So, looking at the options: - A says the vesicle floats freely. That doesn't sound right because after phagocytosis, especially if it's a lysosome engulfment, the vesicle would fuse with the lysosome. - B mentions merging with Golgi; I don't think so because phagocytosis usually involves these organelles directly rather than moving through the Golgi. - C about mitochondrion: No, again, phagocytosis targets specific organelles, not general movement. - D says it fuses with the cell membrane. Wait, no, because once it engulfs the organelle, it shouldn't stay inside; instead, it should release the contents. - E talks about breaking down itself. I don't recall phagocytosis causing breakdown; that's more like the cell cycle. - F about lysosome: This seems possible since lysosomes are involved in degradation after engulfment. - G peroxisome: Not sure about this one; maybe less common but not the primary target. - H endoplasmic reticulum: Also not typical unless it's a special case, but generally, the main target is lysosome. - I to the nucleus: Not relevant here; phagocytosis occurs within the cytoplasm. - J peroxisome: Similar reasoning as G; probably not the first choice. - K nucleus: Again, unrelated; phagocytosis is within the cytoplasm. - L cell membrane: After engulfment, vesicles typically fuse with membranes, not remain inside. - M nucleolus: Unlikely; not the focus of phagocytosis. After considering all options, option D seems incorrect because vesicles should merge with the organelle they engulf, not the membrane. Option F (lysosome) and E (breakdown) seem plausible, but I think D is wrong. Between E and F, the usual outcome is the lysis of the organelle, leading to expulsion of contents.
