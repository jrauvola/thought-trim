  "solution": "\nOkay, so I have to figure out which child is the adopted one based on the given information. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nWe're dealing with the ABO blood group locus in humans. The alleles are I^A, I^B, and i. I^A and I^B are dominant over i, but they themselves are codominant. So, if someone has both I^A and I^B, their genotype would be I^A I^B, right? That means they'll show both A and B antigens on their red blood cells.\n\nThe woman has blood type O. In the ABO system, O is the recessive allele because it doesn't express any antigens. So her genotype must be ii. She marries a man with blood type B. For blood type B, the genotype can be either BB or Bb. Since B is dominant, his genotype could be BB, Bb, or even IBIB if he's hemi-related, but that's less common.\n\nTheir children consist of four kids: two sons and two daughters. One of them is adopted, and we need to find out who that is from the options provided.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Parental Genotypes:**\n   - Mother (O): ii\n   - Father (B): Could be BB, Bb, or IBIB.\n\n2. **Possible Offspring:**\n   - When ii (mother) mates with BB:\n     - All offspring will be B (from mother) + B (father) = BB (type B).\n   - If the father is Bb:\n     - Possible combinations: ii + BB \u2192 B, ii + Bb \u2192 B (since ii is recessive), and Bb + Bb \u2192 Bb (type B).\n   - If the father is IBIB:\n     - All offspring will be IB (since ii is recessive). Wait, no, IBIB is the father's genotype, so all children would get IB from father and i from mother, resulting in IB (AB type).\n\n3. **Given Children:**\n   - Two sons: O blood type.\n   - One daughter with A blood type.\n   - One son with B blood type.\n\nWait, there are four children, including an adopted one. The children are:\n\n- Son: O\n- Daughter: A\n- Son: B\n- One more child, but it's not specified yet.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"four children in the family: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type.\" It also mentions that one is adopted. So the four children include those three plus another, making four total, one of whom is adopted.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see which ones fit into these categories.\n\nOption A: daughter O. That matches the two sons and one daughter mentioned as O.\n\nOption B: son with A blood type. But according to our possible outcomes, when the father is Bb, the children are B. So how does A come into play here? Maybe if the father is BB, but then the children would all be B. Alternatively, maybe the father is IBIB, which would produce IB (A-type). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that. If the father is IBIB, then all his gametes would be IB, and the mother gives i. So all children would be IB, which is A-type (AB). But in the scenario, some children are O, A, B, etc.\n\nAlternatively, if the father is Bb, then:\n\n- ii (mother) + BB (father) \u2192 B (B)\n- ii + Bb \u2192 B (B)\n- Bb + Bb \u2192 Bb (B)\n\nSo children would mostly be B, except if the father is IBIB, leading to A-type.\n\nBut looking back, the children are:\n\n- Son (O)\n- Daughter (A)\n- Son (B)\n\nAnd one more child, possibly O again since the first option is about a daughter O.\n\nWait, the options list things like \"the daughter with O blood type\" and others. So the two sons are O, the daughter is A, and the son is B. Then, one more child could be O, but that's already accounted for in the first option. Or maybe the fourth child is another O, making the adopted one.\n\nBut the options don't mention the fourth child explicitly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are labeled from A to J, with letters representing different possibilities. So among the options, E is \"None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred,\" F is \"the daughter with AB blood type,\" G is \"the son with AB blood type,\" H is \"the son with AB blood type,\" I is \"the daughter with B blood type,\" J is \"the child with a rare blood type not listed.\"\n\nWait, none of the options directly say \"a genetic mutation occurred\" or \"an adoptive parent.\" So maybe the correct answer is E, implying that the adoption happened due to a genetic mutation.\n\nBut let me think again. If the father is BB, then all children would be B, but the scenario includes a daughter with A. So perhaps the father isn't BB but IBIB, which would give A-type children.\n\nIf the father is IBIB, then all children would be IB (A-type), but the scenario shows a daughter with A. So maybe the father is Bb.\n\nIn that case, the children would be mostly B, except if the father is IBIB, leading to A-type. But according to the problem, the children include a daughter with A. So perhaps the father is IBIB, but that contradicts the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the father is Bb, and the children are mostly B, but the problem states there's a daughter with A. This suggests that the father might actually be IBIB, leading to A-type children.\n\nWait, but the problem says the mother is O (ii), father is B. So if the father is Bb, the children would be B (BB) or Bb (if father is Bb). But the problem says there's a daughter with A, which suggests she has A blood type. How can a child have A blood type if the father is Bb?\n\nAh, unless the father is IBIB, which would make all children AB (A-type). But the scenario says one daughter has A blood type, which fits.\n\nSo if the father is IBIB, then the children would all be AB (A-type). But the problem also includes a daughter with A, which fits. Now, the children are:\n\n- Two sons: O\n- One daughter: A\n- One son: B\n- And one more child.\n\nWait, but that makes five children, but the problem says four. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the problem statement says four children: two sons and two daughters. So the four children are:\n\n- Son: O\n- Daughter: A\n- Son: B\n- One more child.\n\nWait, that makes four children. So where's the fifth? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says four children: a son and daughter O, a daughter with A, and a son with B. So that's four. The fifth must be another child, but the problem doesn't specify. However, the issue is about adoption, so perhaps the adopted child is the one who wasn't born, meaning the one without blood type or something else.\n\nBut looking at the options, J is \"the child with a rare blood type not listed.\" So if one child is A-type, another is O, another is B, and the last is, say, AB, but that's not listed. Or maybe it's another blood type.\n\nWait, but if the father is IBIB, all children would be AB (A-type). But the problem includes a daughter with A, which fits.\n\nNow, considering the possible parents:\n\nMother is O (ii), father is B (could be BB, Bb, or IBIB).\n\nCase 1: Father is BB.\n\nChildren would be BB (all B). So children are B, B, B, B. But the problem includes a daughter with A, so this case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Father is Bb.\n\nChildren would be:\n\n- ii + BB \u2192 B (B)\n- ii + Bb \u2192 B (B)\n- Bb + Bb \u2192 Bb (B)\n\nSo all children are B. Again, no A-type, which contradicts the problem.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have a child with A is if the father is IBIB. Because IBIB \u00d7 ii would produce all AB (A-type) children.\n\nThus, the father is IBIB, and the children are all AB.\n\nBut in the problem, the children are:\n\n- Son: O\n- Daughter: A\n- Son: B\n\nWait, that's three children, but the problem says four. So perhaps there's a fourth child who's not mentioned. But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the father is IBIB, leading to A-type children.\n\nNow, the children are:\n\n- Two sons: O and B\n- One daughter: A\n- One more child: ?\n\nBut the options don't mention the fourth child. However, the problem asks which child is adopted, implying one of the existing four is adopted.\n\nSince the father is IBIB, all children should be A-type (AB). But the problem includes a daughter with A, which fits.\n\nNow, the children are:\n\n- Son: O\n- Daughter: A\n- Son: B\n- Fourth child: ?\n\nIf the father is IBIB, all children are A-type, so the fourth child is A.\n\nBut the options don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth child is O, matching option A.\n\nBut the problem says one of the children is adopted. So perhaps the adopted child is the one who didn't receive the expected blood type.\n\nWait, but the problem says the adopted child is one of the four. So the children are:\n\n- Son: O (non-adopted)\n- Daughter: A (adopted?)\n- Son: B (non-adopted)\n- Fourth child: O (adopted?)\n\nBut the problem specifies four children: O, A, B, and one more.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth child could be O, making the adopted child the daughter with A.\n\nWait, but the adopted child is one of the four. So perhaps the adopted child is the daughter with A.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to match the options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. daughter O\n\nB. son A\n\nC. son O\n\nD. daughter A\n\nE. none due to mutation\n\nF. daughter AB\n\nG. son AB\n\nH. son AB\n\nI. daughter B\n\nJ. child with rare blood type\n\nFrom my analysis, the father must be IBIB, leading to A-type children. So the children would be A-type.\n\nGiven that, the four children are:\n\n- O (son)\n- A (daughter)\n- B (son)\n- ? (probably A, since all are A)\n\nSo the adopted child is the daughter with A, which is option D.\n\nWait, but the problem states that one of the children is adopted. So if the adopted child is the daughter with A, then that would be option D.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. So the adopted child is the daughter with A, option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",
