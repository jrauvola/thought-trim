  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThere are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.\n\nThe experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections.\n\nBut let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The result is that only some bacteria show the effect, implying that the phages are interacting at the DNA level.\n\nIn E. coli, the recombination between genes usually requires certain conditions, like double-stranded breaks. For phages, recombination would involve the T_4 DNA from both phages binding together, causing changes in their replication machinery.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, only 4 plumes were found, while on strain K, 40 were found. That seems quite different. Wait, no\u2014strain B was primarily affected, but now we're looking at the effect on strain K. Maybe the initial half had more effect, but then some combined.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sample had both mutation types, and when they divide, the phages might interact. In the first division, half is plated on B, and the other half on K. Since strain B was mainly affected, maybe the phages from the same strain didn't cause issues, but those from another did.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple mutations could lead to some resistance and others. But the key here is determining the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is calculated as the number of recombinant bands divided by the total number of bands. In E. coli, when dealing with phages, this typically refers to the number of recombinants relative to the wild-type.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the two mutants are carrying mutations in rII. Replication origin (rII) mutations often affect whether a phage can replicate inside a bacterial chromosome. However, in E. coli, the rII mutation is associated with lysogenic phage replication, meaning they integrate into the chromosome and don't replicate independently.\n\nIf the two phages carry rII mutations, their combination could lead to incomplete recombination, where the replication origins are in different regions of the chromosome. This would reduce the likelihood of independent replication, potentially leading to different outcomes depending on which replication origin is used.\n\nBut in terms of the experiment, when both phages are present, the result is that some bacteria are resistant (due to lysogeny) and others are not. The difference in plume counts on strain K compared to B indicates that some combination of mutations led to resistance in strain K but not in B.\n\nWait, but strain B was primarily affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage caused the issue. So when the phages are mixed, perhaps some of them cause resistance to both strains, but strain K isn't responsive. Or maybe the presence of one mutation leads to resistance against both, while the other doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the initial division resulted in half being tested on B and the other on K, and only 4 plumes appeared on K, which is much higher than 40 on B. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because strain B was mostly affected, so perhaps the initial division had a mix where some of the phages caused resistance to both strains.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that the recombination between the two mutations determines the likelihood of independent replication. If the rf is low, fewer recombinants form, leading to different outcomes.\n\nGiven the results, I think the correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies / (Total number of colonies - Recombinant colonies) * 100%\n\nSo here, on strain K, there were 40 plumes, and on B, 40 as well? Wait, no\u2014the problem says 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, but that's inconsistent because the initial split should have equal numbers, unless some cells died.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is based on the number of recombinants versus non-recombinants. Alternatively, the formula might be:\n\n(Recombinant / (Recombinant + Non-Recombinant)) * 100%\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to find a better way.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the expected number of plumes. If both mutations are independent, the probability of a phage causing resistance to both strains is very low. However, in reality, some combinations may occur.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. If on strain K, there were 40 plumes, and on B, 4, then maybe the ratio is 4:40, but that seems off because both should be on similar plates.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nSo the first half has high dilution (1e7), so few cells are plated. The second half has lower dilution (1e5), so more cells are plated.\n\nAfter incubation, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, but if the first half is on B's lawn, and the second on K's, why are the numbers so different?\n\nMaybe the initial division caused some phages to replicate and kill on B's lawn, while others replicated and survived on K's. Then, in the first half, only 4 survived, and in the second half, 40 survived.\n\nThat suggests that the phages from the first half were killing B but surviving K, while the phages from the second half caused resistance to both.\n\nWait, but that seems unlikely because the first half is on B's lawn, which should be resistant to lysogenic phages, but the second half is on K's, which is susceptible. So perhaps some combination occurred where some phages caused resistance to both strains.\n\nBut given the data, it's easier to calculate the recombination frequency using the observed plume counts.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is the proportion of plumes that are recombinants. Since strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, perhaps the recombination occurs less frequently.\n\nWait, but I think the formula is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinants) / (total number of recombinants + non-recombinants)\n\nIn this case, if all 40 on K are recombinants, and none on B, but that doesn't make sense because some should survive on B.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to assume that the plumes correspond to the number of recombinants. So on strain K, 40 plumes indicate 40 recombinants, while on B, 4 plumes indicate 4 non-recombinants.\n\nThen RF = 40 / (40 + 4) = 80%, but that's not among the options. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinants. If strain B had 4 plumes and strain K had 40, but that doesn't fit because strain B was more likely to have non-recombinants.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look up the standard method for calculating recombination frequencies in E. coli.\n\nUpon recalling, the formula is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies - number of recombinant colonies) * 100%\n\nHere, suppose that the number of recombinant colonies is the number that appear on both strains. But in this case, the data shows that on strain K, 4 plumes appeared, and on B, 40. It's unclear how they relate.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split into halves is such that the first half was used to test B, and the second half was used to test K. The number of plumes depends on the recombination within each half.\n\nWait, maybe the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants formed. So if in the first half, 4 plumes appeared on B, indicating that 4 cells were resistant to lysogeny, and in the second half, 40 plumes appeared on K, indicating 40 cells became resistant to lysogeny due to recombination.\n\nWait, but how does this translate into recombination frequency? If 4 plumes came from the first half and 40 from the second, but the first half was on B's lawn and the second on K's, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinants in each strain.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to note that the higher number of plumes on B suggests that fewer were recombinants, implying a lower recombination frequency.\n\nWait, if on strain K, 40 plumes appeared, and on B, 4, assuming that the plumes represent recombinant colonies, then the ratio is 4:40. That simplifies to 1:10. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation is based on the number of recombinants divided by the total number of recombinants plus the number of non-recombinants. So if strain K has 40 plumes and B has 4, perhaps strain K has 40 recombinants and B has 4 non-recombinants.\n\nThen RF = 40 / (40 + 4) = 80%. But that's not among the options.\n\nWait, but the answer choices are all below 5% except F (0.3%). So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are reversed. If strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, then RF = 4 / (4 + 40) = 8.3%, still not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the plumes indicate the number of recombinants. If strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, and assuming that the total number of plumes is 44, then RF = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, which is also not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the numbers. Maybe the 4 plumes on K are recombinants, and the 40 on B are non-recombinants. Thus, RF = 4/(4+40) = 8.3%.\n\nStill not matching any of the options. Let me check the options provided:\n\nA. 1%\nB. 2%\nC. 1.5%\nD. 0.1%\nE. 0.2%\nF. 0.3%\nG. 0.5%\nH. 5%\nI. 0.02%\nJ. 0.05%\nK. 0.05% \u2192 No, wait the user wrote \"D. 0.1%\" etc., so maybe J and K are incorrect.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, the RF is around 8%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinant colonies. If strain K had 40 and B had 4, and assuming that the total number of colonies is 44, then RF = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, but that's still not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency can be estimated from the difference in plume counts between the two strains. If strain K had 40 and B had 4, the difference is 36, which might suggest a low recombination frequency.\n\nWait, but that still doesn't align with the options. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies - number of recombinant colonies) * 100%.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to apply. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.02%, as that's the closest to 0.05%, which is an option.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The experiment showed that when both mutation types are present, the resulting colonies on strain K were more resistant (40 vs 4 on B). This suggests that recombination increased the likelihood of resistance in K, possibly because one mutation allowed the other to replicate more efficiently.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is low, say 0.1%, then most of the cells wouldn't have recombined, meaning the mutations would act independently. However, if recombination is high, then some cells would have recombined, leading to more resistance.\n\nGiven that strain K had more plumes, it's possible that recombination increased its susceptibility. The difference between 40 and 4 suggests that recombination happened 36 times, which is a high frequency.\n\nWait, but that's not logical. High recombination would lead to more variation, including more resistance. If the recombination frequency is 0.05%, then only 0.05% of cells would have recombined, leading to more variance.\n\nWait, but in our case, strain K had more plumes (40) than B (4), suggesting that recombination increased K's susceptibility. So if recombination was high, K would have more plumes. But the options include 0.05%, which is quite low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, which is even lower.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on K (40) minus those on B (4) equals 36. This difference could indicate the number of recombinants. If that's the case, then RF = 36 / (40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is still too high.\n\nI must be missing something. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the presence of both mutations leads to increased recombination, thus more cells becoming resistant. The difference in plume counts reflects this increase.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x%, then the number of recombinants would be x% of the total cells. Given that strain K had more plumes, it implies a higher recombination rate.\n\nBut the options don't go beyond 5%, so perhaps the answer is E. 0.05%.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Another thought: the plume count on K is 40, on B is 4. The difference is 36, which is a significant jump. If this represents the number of recombinant cells, then RF = 36 / (40 + 4) \u2248 81.8%, which doesn't match any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to take the difference and divide by the sum to get the RF percentage, but that's still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct calculation is RF = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies) * 100%.\n\nIf strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, and the total number of colonies is 44, then RF = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, which is still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the difference in plume counts reflects the recombination frequency. So, if the difference is 36, and the total is 44, then RF = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which again doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the highest available option, which is G. 0.5%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. 0.1%.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. If strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, then RF = 40/(40 + 4) \u2248 81.8%, which is too high. Alternatively, if strain K had 4 plumes and B had 40, then RF = 4/(4 + 40) \u2248 8.3%, which is closer to option D (0.1%) but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of cells) \u00d7 100%, where the number of recombinant colonies is the difference between the two strains. So, if strain K has 40 and B has 4, then RF = (40 - 4)/44 \u00d7 100% \u2248 81.8%, which is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is x%, then the number of recombinant plumes would be x% of the total cells.\n\nBut I'm going in circles. I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that strain K had more plumes, it suggests that recombination increased its susceptibility. The options include 0.02%, which is the smallest. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The experiment showed that when both mutation types are present, the resulting colonies on strain K were more resistant (40 vs 4 on B). This suggests that recombination increased the likelihood of resistance in K, possibly because one mutation allowed the other to replicate more efficiently.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is low, say 0.1%, then most of the cells wouldn't have recombined, meaning the mutations would act independently. However, if recombination is high, then some cells would have recombined, leading to more resistance.\n\nGiven that strain K had more plumes, it's possible that recombination increased its susceptibility. The difference between 40 and 4 suggests that recombination happened 36 times, which is a high frequency.\n\nWait, but that's not logical. High recombination would lead to more variation, including more resistance. If the recombination frequency is 0.05%, then only 0.05% of cells would have recombined, leading to more variance.\n\nWait, but in our case, strain K had more plumes (40) than B (4), suggesting that recombination increased K's susceptibility. So if recombination was high, K would have more plumes. But the options include 0.05%, which is quite low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, which is even lower.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on K (40) minus those on B (4) equals 36. This difference could indicate the number of recombinants. If that's the case, then RF = 36 / (40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is still too high.\n\nI must be missing something. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the presence of both mutations leads to increased recombination, thus more cells becoming resistant. The difference in plume counts reflects this increase.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x%, then the number of recombinants would be x% of the total cells. Given that strain K had more plumes, it implies a higher recombination rate.\n\nBut the options don't go beyond 5%, so perhaps the answer is E. 0.05%.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Another thought: the plume count on K is 40, on B is 4. The difference is 36, which is a significant jump. If this represents the number of recombinant cells, then RF = 36 / (40 + 4) \u2248 81.8%, which doesn't match any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to take the difference and divide by the sum to get the RF percentage, but that's still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct calculation is RF = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies) * 100%.\n\nIf strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, and the total number of colonies is 44, then RF = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, which is still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the difference in plume counts reflects the recombination frequency. So, if the difference is 36, and the total is 44, then RF = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which again doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the highest available option, which is G. 0.5%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. 0.1%.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. If strain K had 40 plumes and B had 4, then RF = 40/(40 + 4) \u2248 81.8%, which is too high. Alternatively, if strain K had 4 plumes and B had 40, then RF = 4/(4 + 40) \u2248 8.3%, which is closer to option D (0.1%) but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of cells) \u00d7 100%, where the number of recombinant colonies is the difference between the two strains. So, if strain K has 40 and B has 4, then RF = (40 - 4)/44 \u00d7 100% \u2248 81.8%, which is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is x%, then the number of recombinant plumes would be x% of the total cells.\n\nBut I'm going in circles. I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that strain K had more plumes, it suggests that recombination increased its susceptibility. The options include 0.02%, which is the smallest. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
