If they're from the same mutation (like both lysogenic), then having both shouldn't make a difference because the lysogenic phage should work regardless. However, if they're from different mutations, their combined effect could be additive, meaning more plasmids would be lost than expected, leading to fewer plumes on strain B compared to K, where maybe each mutation has its own effect without interference.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is usually (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). In this case, since we have a diploid organism, each daughter cell gets one copy from each parent. Recombination occurs when the two alleles come from different parents. So, the number of recombinant plasmids would depend on how often the two mutations occur in different cells during replication.\n\nLooking at the numbers, when both mutants are present, only 40 plumes appeared on strain B. Normally, without any interaction, you'd expect an equal number of plumes on both strains, but if they interact, the expectation changes. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis, it might preferentially replicate in certain conditions. The lower number on B suggests that when both mutants are present, the dominant phage (the lysogenic one) isn't causing as much damage as expected, implying that the other phage (mutant) may be interfering or that the two are interacting.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, when both are present, if they're from different sources, their combined effect could lead to fewer plumes on one strain because the lysogenic phage might dominate, leading to more plasmid loss. Alternatively, if they're from the same source, the lysogenic phage alone would cause problems, but when mixed with another lysogenic variant, perhaps it's less efficient, resulting in more plasmids being lost.\n\nBut let's think about the actual calculation. The total number of plasmids is 4 + 40 = 44. The recombinant ones would be the ones where the two mutations are in different cells, leading to more plasmids being lost. So, the ratio of recombants over total is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. That's roughly 10%, but looking at the options, the closest is D.0.1 percent. Wait, that doesn't match my initial thought. Maybe I'm mixing up the approach.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes recombination frequencies are calculated using the formula (R)/(N+R), where R is the number of recombinant offspring and N is the non-recombinant. Here, total plumes are 44, recombinant is 4, so R/(N+R) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. But none of the options match exactly. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept.\n\nAnother approach: the expected number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Suppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage is p and the frequency of the other mutation is q. Then, the probability of recombination is pq. So, if the number of plumes on B is higher when both are present, it suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't interfere much, implying low recombination. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage interferes, the number increases on B because the lysogenic phage takes over more plasmids.\n\nGiven that 40 plumes appear on B when both mutants are present, and 4 on K, which is half of B's sample size? Wait, the samples are different dilutions: 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5. The ratio of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K. Let's see: the ratio is 10 times, suggesting that the effect of the second mutation is significant because the plume count increased by 10 times. This implies that when both mutants are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to more plasmid loss, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more likely to take plasmids from the other mutation.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be high because the two mutations are more likely to be inherited together. Wait, but earlier I thought the recombination frequency was around 10%, which isn't among the options. The closest option is D.0.1 percent. But wait, maybe I'm confusing the calculation.\n\nLet me try again. The expected number of recombinant plasmids is pq(N+R), where N is the total number of plasmids and R is the recombining fraction.

Here, total is 44, recombinant is 4, so F=4/44\u22480.0909 or 9.09%. None of the options match this directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the percentage of recombination events. If F is approximately 10%, that's 0.1% relative to the possible maximum. Looking back at the options, D is 0.1 percent.

In phages, this would mean that if two different phages' genes interact, they might produce a recombinant phage that has a unique combination of their mutations.\n\nThe key here is understanding how these plumes relate to the number of recombinations. Each time a phage infects, it can cause a change in the plume size. If a mutation from one phage interferes with another, you'd see a larger change in the number of plumes because the infection is more efficient or less efficient due to the mutation.\n\nIn the first case, when only lysogenic phage is used, most bacteria die, so there are few plumes. When both types are present, the presence of both phages leads to more plumes, indicating that each mutation contributes to the overall effect. The ratio of plumes on K to B gives an idea about the relative contributions of each mutation.\n\nBut how do we translate the number of plumes into recombination? I think the number of plumes can be related to the efficiency of the infection. A higher number of plumes means that the infection was more effective, perhaps because the phage was more compatible with the host, or because it integrated better, leading to more recombination.\n\nWait, actually, when two phages have recombined, the resulting phage may have a mutation that affects its ability to infect. So, if one mutation makes a phage less likely to integrate into the genome, maybe it reduces the chance of successful infection. Thus, when you dilute the phage, the number of plumes increases because the phage isn't as effective at infecting the cells.\n\nSo, let's say without any recombination, only one type of phage is used. Placing it on strain B's lawn would show a certain number of plumes. With recombination, the number of plumes increases because the phage becomes less effective, so more cells survive and get infected. Therefore, the increase in plumes indicates the presence of recombination.\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B's lawn, when only lysogenic phage is used, the number of plumes is low\u2014probably around 1-10. But when both types are used, the plumes increase significantly. However, in the experiment, the other half is placed on strain K's lawn instead of B's. Strain K is probably strain B without the lysogenic mutation, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that the other half is placed on strain K. So, strain K is presumably strain B minus the lysogenic mutation. Because when both types are used, the other half is on strain K, meaning that strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation. So, the number of plumes on strain K's lawn tells us about the effect of the lysogenic phage.\n\nBut the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations, which are the lysogenic and the other mutation (the one causing lytic fission in strain B). Recombination would occur if the lysogenic phage integrates into the T_4 genome, creating a new mutation that allows it to infect.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage integrates, it changes the structure of the phage. This integration could affect the phage's infectivity. So, if the phage integrates, it might become more efficient at infecting the cells, reducing the number of plumes. Alternatively, if the phage doesn't integrate well, it might reduce the infectivity, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nFrom the data, when both phages are present, the plumes on strain B's lawn are 40, and on strain K's lawn, it's 4. Since strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, it should be less affected by the lysogenic phage, hence fewer plumes. The fact that it's only 4 plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage caused significant damage because it was integrating into the T_4 genome.\n\nNow, to determine the recombination rate. The number of plumes can indicate the degree of recombination. If the lysogenic phage integrated, it might have produced a recombinant phage that is less efficient than either parent. So, the presence of more plumes (on strain B) suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate efficiently, leading to more plumes.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to calculate the fraction of cells that survived the infection. If the lysogenic phage integrates, the survival rate decreases, leading to more plumes. Conversely, if no integration occurs, the phage infects all cells, and the survival rate is high, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nThe formula to estimate the recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = 1 - e^{-2p}\n\nWhere p is the probability of recombination per site. But since the options are given in percentages, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAnother way is to use the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage integrates, the number of plumes increases. Suppose the baseline (only one phage) has N plumes, then with recombination, it's N + \u0394N. The change in plumes (\u0394N) is proportional to the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that, the increase from N=10 to N=40 suggests a significant increase. Let's assume that without recombination, only one phage is used, so N is small. Then, when both are used, N increases. The exact calculation depends on how much the phage integrates.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, N is around 10. With recombination, N becomes 40, which is four times as many. That suggests a factor of 4 increase, which could correspond to a recombination rate where the product of the probabilities of recombination at each site equals 4/5, assuming independent events.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the expected number of plumes under recombination. If the probability of recombination is r, then the expected number of plumes would be N * (1 + r), where N is the baseline. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look for a standard method.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plumes can give the log odds of recombination. If the baseline is 10 plumes, and with recombination it's 40, the ratio is 4. Using the formula for the likelihood ratio test, ln(4) \u2248 1.386, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 1%.

But here, since only K's phage is being tested against strain B, maybe the presence of multiple phages affects the outcome. The key part seems to be about the ratio of plumes observed in each culture. I think this has to do with the concept of \"double-strand break\" repair, where double-strand breaks occur, leading to more plasmid replication and thus more phage lysis. If two phages interfere, their interactions might lead to more or fewer plasmids, affecting the number of phages that lyse the cells. \n\nThe formula used for calculating the interference is sometimes given as the expected number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) without interference multiplied by the probability of another DSB occurring at the same site. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with the effect on the number of phages that lyse. So maybe the number of plumes relates to how many times the phage caused damage.\n\nIn the first culture (strain B), only the lysogenic phage did damage, and the second culture had both types. Since the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, the double-strand breaks from both phages would have been negligible, explaining why most plumes appeared in the first culture. However, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage might have been involved in causing more damage due to the interference from the other phage type. \n\nWait, the numbers are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's a ratio of about 10:1. If I recall correctly, when there's interference, the number of offspring plasmids is reduced by a factor related to the square root of the number of phages interfering. So if you have n phages interfering, the expected number of offspring plasmids per original phage is sqrt(n). Therefore, the number of plumes observed should be proportional to sqrt(n).\n\nGiven that, let's set up the equation. Suppose n is the number of phages interfering. Then the observed number of plumes (P) is P = N * sqrt(n), where N is the number of phages contributing to the interference. Wait, actually, I think it's inversely related: the observed plumes are less than the expected without interference, by a factor of sqrt(n). Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nIf there are n phages interfering, the expected number of phages per original phage is 1/n. The actual number would then decrease by a factor of 1/sqrt(n). So the observed number of plumes would be higher than expected by a factor of sqrt(n). Alternatively, the observed number is lower by a factor of sqrt(n). \n\nIn our case, the observed number of plumes on B was much higher than on K. On B, it was 40 plumes, while on K, it was 4. So 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the interference caused a reduction by a factor of 10. If the interference reduces the expected number by a factor of 10, then sqrt(n) = 10, so n = 100. That means 100 phages were interfering. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, not the number of phages interfering. Recombination refers to the proportion of double-strand breaks in the phage genomes that interacted with the host genome. Each mutation introduces certain regions of DNA that could potentially recombine. \n\nEach mutation (mutant) likely contributes to creating new double-strand breaks. If both mutations are active, the recombinatory activity depends on how often these breaks interact. The expected number of recombinational double-strand breaks (DSBs) would depend on the product of the probabilities of each mutation introducing a DSB and the probability that they recombine. \n\nAssuming that each mutation independently introduces a DSB with a certain frequency, say p and q respectively, the probability of recombining is approximately p*q. But the exact calculation requires knowing the frequencies. However, since the problem doesn't provide specific frequencies, perhaps we can relate the number of plumes to the recombination fraction directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages that successfully replicated due to interference, and since the interference caused the observed plume count to drop by a factor of 10, we can infer that the number of recombination events (which determines the interference) is such that n = 100. But since recombination is the product of the individual recombination fractions, if each mutation has a recombination frequency of r, then the total recombination frequency would be r*r = r\u00b2. So if r\u00b2 = 0.01 (since 1% corresponds to a recombination frequency squared being 0.0001, but that's not matching), wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The number of plumes is influenced by the number of double-strand breaks, which occurs when the host genome interacts with the phage genome. Each mutation may contribute to creating new sites for DSBs. If both mutations are present, the likelihood of recombination increases. The observed difference in plume counts reflects the increased or decreased efficiency of the phage replication due to interference.\n\nSince the observed plumes are 10 times more frequent on B than on K, this suggests that the interference caused by the two mutations leads to a 10-fold increase in the plasmid replication rate. The relationship between interference and recombination frequency is that interference decreases by a factor equal to the square root of the number of interfering events. So if the interference drops by 10 times, the number of interfering events is 10\u00b2=100. Thus, the recombination frequency must be high enough to account for 100 interfering events.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the individual recombination frequencies of each mutation, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage. But since the question provides options, and the correct answer is supposed to be among them, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the plume ratios.\n\nAnother angle: when two phages interfere, the number of plasmids replicated is reduced by a factor equal to the square root of the number of interfering phages. In our case, the observed number of plumes is 10 times more on B than on K, indicating a 10x reduction. Assuming that this reduction corresponds to an interference factor of 10, the number of interfering phages is 100. The recombination frequency would then be 1%, because 100 interfering events imply that each phage has a 1% chance of interacting, leading to 100 possible interactions.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that during phage infection, if two different mutagenic phages interfere, they might cause more destruction. But here, since only K's phage is being tested against strain B, maybe the presence of multiple phages affects the outcome. The key part seems to be about the ratio of plumes observed in each culture. I think this has to do with the concept of \"double-strand break\" repair, where double-strand breaks occur, leading to more plasmid replication and thus more phage lysis. If two phages interfere, their interactions might lead to more or fewer plasmids, affecting the number of phages that lyse the cells. \n\nThe formula used for calculating the interference is sometimes given as the expected number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) without interference multiplied by the probability of another DSB occurring at the same site. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with the effect on the number of phages that lyse. So maybe the number of plumes relates to how many times the phage caused damage.\n\nIn the first culture (strain B), only the lysogenic phage did damage, and the second culture had both types. Since the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, the double-strand breaks from both phages would have been negligible, explaining why most plumes appeared in the first culture. However, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage might have been involved in causing more damage due to the interference from the other phage type. \n\nWait, the numbers are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's a ratio of about 10:1. If I recall correctly, when there's interference, the number of offspring plasmids is reduced by a factor related to the square root of the number of phages interfering. So if you have n phages interfering, the expected number of offspring plasmids per original phage is sqrt(n). Therefore, the number of plumes observed should be proportional to sqrt(n).\n\nGiven that, let's set up the equation. Suppose n is the number of phages interfering. Then the observed number of plumes (P) is P = N * sqrt(n), where N is the number of phages contributing to the interference. Wait, actually, I think it's inversely related: the observed plumes are less than the expected without interference, by a factor of sqrt(n). Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nIf there are n phages interfering, the expected number of phages per original phage is 1/n. The actual number would then decrease by a factor of 1/sqrt(n). So the observed number of plumes would be higher than expected by a factor of sqrt(n). Alternatively, the observed number is lower by a factor of sqrt(n). \n\nIn our case, the observed number of plumes on B was much higher than on K. On B, it was 40 plumes, while on K, it was 4. So 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the interference caused a reduction by a factor of 10. If the interference reduces the expected number by a factor of 10, then sqrt(n) = 10, so n = 100. That means 100 phages were interfering. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, not the number of phages interfering. Recombination refers to the proportion of double-strand breaks in the phage genomes that interacted with the host genome.

The idea is that if you dilute each plating lot enough, the chance of recombination increases. If you dilute too much, the effect becomes negligible.\n\nIn the classic double mutation scenario, where two mutations occur independently, the expected recombination rate is given by the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring at a certain dilution. But here, we're dealing with different dilutions for each group.\n\nLet me think about how this works. Each mutation source has its own recombination frequency. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability of recombination between the two mutations in T_4. Then, the overall probability would be p*(1 - p), assuming that if one occurs, the other doesn't (but that might not be the case here).\n\nBut since these are mutant phages, maybe their recombinases work together, so perhaps p = probability of recombination. Alternatively, if they don't interfere, then the occurrence could be additive, but in reality, it's more likely a multiplicative process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it using the formula for independent events. The expected number of recombined plumes would be the sum of the products of the frequencies of each mutation and the probability of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each group is tested separately, the total number of plumes observed can help determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nWait, let me try to calculate it. Suppose there are two mutation types, A and B. The probability of recombination is p, so the occurrence of either mutation without recombination is (1-p)*p_A + (1-p)*p_B, where p_A and p_B are the recombination rates for each mutation alone. However, without knowing p_A and p_B, it's tricky. Maybe another approach.\n\nIn the first group, treated with 1:10^7 dilution, the expectation is that any recombination would lead to higher plume density, but with such low dilution, the chance of recombination may be low. In the second group, 1:10^5 dilution, the chance of recombination is higher because the dilution is lower.\n\nThe ratio of plumes from each group can give an estimate of the relative recombination frequency. Since the first group had 4 plumes and the second had 40, the ratio is 10 times higher. This suggests that the second group has a tenfold higher chance of producing recombined plumes than the first. That could imply that the recombination probability is proportional to the dilution factor. Specifically, if the first group was treated with a 1:10^7 dilution, and the second with 1:10^5, then treating them with 1:10^n would produce n/7 increments in the chance of recombination.\n\nSince the ratio is 10, which is 10^(1/7) \u2248 1.38, meaning that the recombination probability is approximately 1.38%. But looking at the options, option C is 1.5%, which is close. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10, that's 10^(1/7) \u2248 1.38, so roughly 1.4% or 1.5%.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The formula for the expected number of recombination plumes when testing with two mutations under selection is given by:\n\nE = (1/(a*b)) * [p_A + p_B + p_AB], where a and b are the dilution factors, and p_AB is the probability of recombination. But in our case, since only two mutations are involved, and only A and B, perhaps the formula simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of recombined plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring at those dilution levels multiplied by the recombination probability.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nSo, let me think about what happens during phage infection. Normally, phages cause lytic fission if they integrate their genes into the host genome. If they don't integrate (like the lysogenic phage), they replicate inside the cell without causing lysis. So, in this case, the lysogenic phage should be the one that affects E. coli strain B more than the lytic one because it doesn't cause lytic fission. \n\nWhen the two mutants are present together, the E. coli strains might show some kind of recombination where they can interact or influence each other's activity. This could lead to different outcomes depending on whether the phage integrase (the enzyme that integrates the phage's DNA into the host genome) is present or absent. \n\nIn the initial experiment, only the lysogenic phage would affect strain B. So, when mixed with the lytic phage, maybe some of the lysogenic phage could integrate the lysogenic gene (from the other type) into its own genome. Alternatively, the phage might have an integrase, allowing some interaction between the two mutants. \n\nThe dilution factors are important here. Diluting 1:10^7 means adding 1 part of the phage solution to 10^7 parts of the lawn. Similarly for 1:10^5. The number of plumes observed depends on the probability of the phage successfully integrating into the host genome. \n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the integration of one might allow the other to function better or worse. For example, if the phage can integrate the lysogenic mutation into itself, it might cause more or fewer plasmids replication. Wait, no\u2014when you have integrated phages, they typically replicate more efficiently, but in this case, the lysogenic phage shouldn't replicate as much because it doesn't cause lytic fission. So maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the other mutation to integrate into its genome. \n\nLet me consider the expected number of plumes. Normally, if the phage doesn't integrate, the lysogenic phage should cause a certain number of plumes, say N. If it integrates, maybe it causes fewer plumes, like M </think>\nThe correct answer is H",

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, plumes mean successful infection, right? So if the phages caused the E. coli to lyse, we'd see more plumes. Since the lysogenic phage didn't cause much damage when alone, maybe the recombination allows for independent replication, leading to more plumes when both are present. But how does that translate into recombination frequency?\n\nI remember that when two genes are linked, the number of recombinants depends on their distance. If they're nearly linked, you get fewer recombinants. In this case, since the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B much, perhaps the recombination frequency is low, meaning they don't separate much.\n\nThe formula I think applies here is related to the number of independent sets observed. If F1 has x and y mutants, then when crossed with each other, the F2 shows certain numbers. For example, if a parent has two wildcards, the F1 would have one wild and one mutant. Then, crossing these F1s together would give four offspring, but the expected distribution depends on recombination frequency. \n\nIn this problem, the number of plumes on K is higher than on B. That might suggest that the recombination happened enough times for the lysogenic phage to be more effective on K's lawn. Wait, no\u2014strain B is being plated on its own lawn, while strain K is being plated on strain B's lawn. Hmm, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage affects the ability of the phage to replicate, thus increasing the chance of causing lytic fission. \n\nBut wait, the original experiment showed that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage does something bad. But when only one type is present, only the lysogenic does something bad. That suggests that the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively independently, leading to more plumes when both are present. However, when only one type is present, the lysogenic still does something bad, so maybe the recombination isn't too high.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (RF), I think the formula is RF = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total possible). But in this case, it's about plumes. Each plume represents an independent replication event. \n\nIf the recombination occurs once, then each chromosome has one mutation. If twice, both are mutated. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at the ratio of plumes. On strain K, there are 4 plumes, and on B, 40. Since strain K was plated on strain B's lawn, any plumes on K must be due to the phages affecting strain B. Similarly, plumes on B could be due to the phages affecting strain B.\n\nWait, actually, the first half (plated on B) resulted in 40 plumes, and the second half (plated on K) had 4 plumes. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage increased the likelihood of plasmid loss, making the phage more efficient at replicating. Because when the phage is present on strain K's lawn, the plasmids are lost less often, allowing more plasmids to replicate, hence more plumes. Conversely, when the phage is present on strain B's lawn, plasmids are lost more often, resulting in fewer plumes.\n\nSo the increase from 40 to 4 plumes indicates that the lysogenic phage is more effective on K's lawn. This likely means that the recombination frequency is low, as the phage can replicate without significant interference. \n\nNow, to relate this to the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, then the probability of recombination during gamete formation is very low. How does this relate to the number of plumes?\n\nEach plume represents a successful replication event. The number of plumes increases with the recombination rate. The formula relating the number of plumes (n) to the recombination frequency (rf) is n = (1 - rf)/2 + sqrt((1 - rf)/2)^2. But since rf is very small, we can approximate n \u2248 rf/2.\n\nGiven that the difference in plumes is 36 (from 40 to 4), assuming all other factors are equal, this corresponds to roughly rf \u2248 0.05% (since 36 \u2248 rf/2 \u2192 rf\u224872, but that seems off). Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nIf the number of plumes increases by 36 units when moving from 40 to 4, and considering the approximation n \u2248 rf/2, then 36 \u2248 rf/2 \u2192 rf\u224872%. That can't be right because rf is supposed to be low. Alternatively, perhaps the change is proportional to the square root of rf. Using the formula n = (sqrt(2rf) ) / 2, solving for rf when n=36:\n\n36 = (sqrt(2rf))/2 \u2192 sqrt(2rf)=72 \u2192 2rf=72\u00b2=5184 \u2192 rf=2592%.\n\nThat's way too high. Clearly, my approach is wrong. Maybe I should consider the ratio of plumes directly. The ratio of plumes on K to B is 4:40 = 1:10. If the plumes are proportional to the recombination rate, then rf = (plumes on K)/(plumes on B) * 100% = (4/40)*100% = 10%. But that contradicts earlier thoughts. Alternatively, maybe rf is inversely proportional because the effect on strain B is stronger.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful replications. If the recombination rate is low, the number of plumes shouldn't be drastically different. Since the increase from 40 to 4 plumes suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to more plumes, implying lower recombination. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for independent assortment, where the number of recombinant types equals (number of parents - number of recombinants). Here, the parents are the two plasmid types, and recombinants are those where the lysogeny is present on one and not the other. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall the concept of linkage and recombination frequency. The number of plumes on each lawn can indicate the degree of recombination. If recombination is high, the phage would be more likely to replicate independently, leading to more plumes. Since the lysogenic phage affects strain B more, the presence of recombination allows the lysogenic to replicate better on strain K, resulting in more plumes on K.\n\nGiven the data, the number of plumes on K is 4, on B is 40. The ratio is approximately 1:10, suggesting that the recombination frequency is around 10%. But looking back, the answer choices don't include 10%; the closest is H.5 percent. Hmm, but I thought earlier it might be 0.05%. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the increase from 40 to 4 plumes suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage makes the phage more efficient. If the recombination were complete, the lysogenic would always replicate, but here it varies. Perhaps the recombination is minimal, leading to a few plumes when both types are present, and more when only one type is present.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on K is 4, which is 10% of the 40 on B. But since K is being plated on B's lawn, and B's lawn has 40 plumes, perhaps this reflects the proportion of plasmids lost. If the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of plasmid loss, leading to more plasmids remaining, hence more plumes. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship. Given the options, the most plausible answer is C.1.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, since the difference is 36 plumes, and if rf is about 0.05%, that would make sense because 0.05% * 2 = 0.001, which is negligible compared to 36. Therefore, the correct answer is D.0.1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So if the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysogeny) doesn't interact with the lytic phage (which shouldn't), then all lysogenic phages would replicate successfully, leading to more plumes. But since some plumes didn't occur on strain B, maybe some interaction happened. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of different phages affects each other. \n\nThe formula for calculating recombinant frequency is F = (number of recombinants)/(total number of possible combinations). In this case, the total combinations would be the product of the dilution factors, right? Because each half was diluted differently. So the first group was 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium has 1 phage every 10^7 bacteria. The second group was 1:10^5. If the phages don't recombine, the total would be 1/10^7 * 1/10^5 = 1/10^12. But here, we observed some plumes, so some recombination must have occurred. \n\nThe observed plumes suggest that only a fraction of the phages combined successfully. Since the first group had higher dilution (more likely to have non-recombinant phages) and the second group had lower dilution (more chance for recombination), the ratio might relate to the frequency. However, I'm getting confused here. Maybe another approach: the expected number of plumes from complete recombination would be proportional to the dilution factors. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the first group (diluted 1:10^7) showed fewer plumes than the second group (diluted 1:10^5), this implies that interactions occurred more frequently at higher dilutions. The ratio of the plume counts could give an estimate of the recombination frequency. \n\nLet me think about how the frequency relates to the plume counts. Suppose the probability of recombination is p. Then, the expected number of plumes from the interaction would be related to the product of the dilution factors. Maybe the ratio of plumes from the two groups reflects the frequency of recombination. \n\nIf the first group had 4 plumes and the second had 40, perhaps this indicates that recombination occurred 4/40 times as often as no recombination. That's a 25% rate. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. 4 vs. 40 gives a ratio of 1:10, suggesting that recombination happened 10 times less frequently. Or maybe inversely\u2014since the second group had more plumes, implying more successful interactions. Hmm, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAnother angle: the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula F = (m - n)/m, where m is the total number of possible combinations, and n is the number without any combination. Here, m would be the product of the dilution factors, say 1e-7 * 1e-5 = 1e-12. But since we saw some plumes, perhaps F is the proportion of successful interactions over total possible. \n\nGiven that the plume count is 4 on B and 40 on K, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that recombination happened 10 times less frequently. If the maximum possible is 1, then F would be 0.1, which is 10%. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option D, 0.05%, which is much smaller. Maybe my reasoning is off.\n\nPerhaps instead, the recombination frequency is calculated as (number of successful interactions)/(number of potential interactions). If the first group had 4 plumes and the second had 40, maybe the actual recombinant frequency is the minimum of the two, which is 4. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, let me look for a simpler way. The expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the product of the dilution factors. For example, if you have two populations diluting at rates r1 and r2, the expected number of recombinants would be (r1*r2)*F. If r1=1e-7 and r2=1e-5, their product is 1e-12. If F is the frequency of recombination, then expected recombinant plumes would be 1e-12*F. But we observed 4 plumes, which is way too low. \n\nThis suggests that either the assumption is incorrect or I'm missing something. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for combining independent probabilities. The probability of recombining at the first level is p, and at the second level is q. Then, the overall recombination probability is p*q. The number of successful plumes would be proportional to p*q. \n\nAssuming that the first group's success rate is p, and the second is q, then the ratio of plumes would be p*q : (1-p)(1-q). Given that the observed plumes are 4 vs. 40, perhaps the ratio is 4/(4+40) = 1/11 \u2248 9.1%. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of successful interactions is 4, while the total possible interactions are 4 + 40 = 44. So F = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is approximately 10%. But again, none of the options match that. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. \n\nLooking back, the answer choices are A to H, with D being 0.05%. That's very low. Maybe I should consider the number of plumes and assume that the frequency is based on the ratio. 4 plumes on K compared to 40 on B. The ratio is 1:10, meaning recombination happened 10 times less frequently. If the maximum possible is 1, then F is 0.1, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is F = (number of recombinants)/(total number of possible combinations). Total combinations would be (1e-7 + 1e-5)^2, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe the total is (1e-7)*(1e-5) = 1e-12. Recombinant plumes are 4, so F = 4 / 1e-12 \u2248 4e11, which is impossible. \n\nI'm stuck. Maybe looking for similar problems or formulas will help. Oh wait, I remember that the expected number of recombinant plumes is given by (p*q)/(1-p)*(1-q), assuming independent recombination events. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the expected number of recombinant plumes would be the product of the dilution factors multiplied by the frequency of recombination. So if F is the frequency, then expected plumes R = (1e-7 * 1e-5) * F. If we see 4 plumes, then 4 = 1e-12 * F \u2192 F = 4e11, which isn't possible. \n\nMaybe the problem assumes that the maximum possible is 1, so F = 4/1 = 4, but that's also not matching the options. I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. \n\nIf the two groups are mixed, and the recombination happens at one level but not the other, then the plume count would reflect that. For example, if recombination occurs in the first dilution (1e-7) but not in the second (1e-5), then the total plumes would be 1e-7 * F * (1e-5). Similarly, if recombination doesn't happen in the first but does in the second, it would be (1 - F) * 1e-5. \n\nBut the observed plumes are 4 on K and 40 on B. Maybe K shows more plumes because recombination happens more often there. If recombination is more frequent in K's group, then K's plumes would be higher. So perhaps the recombination frequency is such that the product (1e-7 * 1e-5) * F equals 4, but that leads to F being 4e11, which is impossible. \n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Let me take a step back. The correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nF = (R) / (a * b)\n\nwhere a and b are the dilution factors, and R is the number of recombinant plumes. If R is 4, and a*b is 1e-12, then F = 4 / 1e-12 = 4e11, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach is flawed. \n\nPerhaps instead, the formula considers the inverse. Let me search my memory: sometimes the frequency is calculated as (number of recombinants) / (sum of products). For example, F = R / (a + b). If a=1e-7 and b=1e-5, then F=4/(1e-7 + 1e-5)=4/1.0001e-6\u22484e6, still not helpful. \n\nI think I'm stuck and need to refer to the options provided. The closest plausible answer based on ratios is that recombination happened 1/10th of the time. But none of the options directly state that. The highest option is G (0.5%) and the next is F (0.3%). Considering the observed ratio of 4:40 simplifies to 1:10, indicating a lower recombination frequency. If the frequency is 0.05%, that's 1/2000, which is close to 0.05%, so option D. Alternatively, 0.1% is 1/1000, closer to 0.1%. \n\nGiven that the ratio is 1:10, the frequency is 1/10, which is 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is the lowest possible, which is D (0.05%). \n\nSo I'll go with D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so let's break this down. If the two mutants recombine, their offspring would have either the lysogenic or the lytic mutation, depending on where the recombination happened. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it should be more common in the strain B culture. But why is only 4 plumes found on K? Maybe the recombination isn't complete, or perhaps the initial dilution affects the probability of recombination. \n\nThe number of plumes depends on the frequency of recombination events. Each duplication event can lead to new combinations. For example, if the recombination happens once, each daughter phage has a certain probability of having the mutation. In the first experiment, the half was plated on strain B, which expects more lysogenic phages without recombination because strain B might already have some lysogenic phages. But since both types are present, maybe some of the phages from the other half (the 1:10^5 dilution) combine with those from strain B, leading to recombinant phages that don't lyse as much. However, the observed data shows fewer plumes on strain K than expected, suggesting that the lysogenic phages aren't doing as well here. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage allows for more efficient replication within the E. coli, making it harder for the other type to cause issues. Or perhaps the incomplete dilution leads to lower numbers of viable phages. Alternatively, the recombination could be partially effective, leading to some plasmid loss in the lysogenic phage.\n\nLet me think about how plasmid copy number relates to these results. If the two mutations recombine, the resulting phage would have a mix of the two mutations. The number of plasmids per cell determines whether a phage is lysogenic or lytic. So, if a cell has multiple copies of the recombined phage, it can replicate more efficiently, potentially causing more lysis. Therefore, the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of lysogenic phages replicating quickly, leading to higher numbers of lysogenic phages in the population.\n\nIn the first experiment, where the half is plated on strain B, the expectation is that most cells have no recombination (since strain B may already have lysogenic phages), leading to fewer lysogenic phages replicating. However, the observed result is 40 plumes on B, which is significantly higher than expected under pure recombination. This suggests that some recombination occurred because the high plume count indicates many successful lysis events, implying that some cells have successfully combined the mutations.\n\nWhen the half is plated on strain K, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the expectation is lower lysogenic phages, hence fewer plumes. However, the observed result is 4 plumes on K, which is still higher than expected but less than on B. This discrepancy suggests that the degree of recombination must be quantified based on the difference in plume counts.\n\nThe formula used to estimate recombination frequency (theta) is:\n\nNumber of plumes = 1 + log10(theta)\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\nlog10(theta) = Number of plumes - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFor B:\nlog10(theta_B) = 40 - 1 = 39 \u2192 theta_B \u2248 1e39\n\nBut this seems way too high. Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plumes between the two experiments.\n\nAnother approach: Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination fraction. Then, the number of plumes on strain B (with possible recombination) and strain K (without) can help determine r.\n\nEach time a recombination occurs, the phage gains an extra mutation. The number of times this happens across all cells will affect the distribution of plasmids. If the original half had some recombination, then the subsequent half, when plated on K, would show less because K lacks the lysogenic mutation.\n\nAssuming that during the initial plating, some recombination occurred, the second plating (on K) would see fewer plumes due to the lack of the lysogenic mutation. The observed results suggest that on B, the plumes increased, indicating some recombination occurred before being plated on K.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nr = 10^(N-1)\n\nWhere N is the number of plumes. For B:\n\nr = 10^(40-1) = 1e39, which is impossible because r cannot exceed 1. That suggests my formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nr = 10^(plume_count - 1)\n\nBut even at 40 plumes, that gives r=1e39, which is way beyond 1. Clearly, this approach isn\u2019t working.\n\nMaybe instead, we use the fact that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombination events. Each recombination adds an extra mutation, increasing the chance of replication and thus causing more lysis. The increase in plumes from 0 to 40 suggests significant recombination. Using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = 1 + n * theta\n\nWhere n is the number of cells. Assuming n is large enough, and theta is small, this approximation holds. Solving for theta:\n\n40 = 1 + n * theta \u2192 theta = (40 - 1)/n\n\nSimilarly, for K:\n\n4 = 1 + m * theta \u2192 theta = (4 - 1)/m = 3/m\n\nSince theta should be the same, set (39/n) = (3/m). Also, n and m are roughly similar, so m \u2248 n. Thus,\n\n39/n \u2248 3/n \u2192 which implies 39 \u2248 3, which is not true. Hence, this approach might not be accurate.\n\nPerhaps a better method is to use the ratio of plumes. The increase from 0 to 40 suggests a significant recombination rate. Let's assume that each recombination event increases the plume density by a factor. The exact calculation might require knowing the initial distribution, but given the limited data, we can make an educated guess.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, then the number of plumes would increase proportionally. Given that the change from B to K is from 40 to 4 plumes, which is a factor of 10 reduction, it suggests that recombination occurs infrequently. However, considering that 40 plumes indicate a high level of recombination, perhaps around 0.05%?\n\nWait, let's try calculating. Suppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the expected number of plumes can be modeled as proportional to r. If the initial plume count on B is 40, and on K it's 4, the ratio is 10. So, 40 / 4 = 10. This suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes scales inversely with the square root of r, assuming Poisson statistics. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the formula:\n\nThe mean number of plumes \u03bc is related to theta by \u03bc = 1 + theta ln(10). But I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way is to note that the change in plume count from B to K is from 40 to 4, which is a tenfold decrease. Since the recombination affects the efficiency of lysogenic phages, a larger recombination rate would lead to more lysogenic phages replicating, thus more lysis. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be relatively low to cause this shift.\n\nGiven the options provided, 0.05% (option J) and 0.02% (option I) seem very low, but maybe they're close. Alternatively, 0.05% might correspond to approximately 1/2000, which is a small recombination rate.\n\nWait, another angle: The difference in plumes suggests that the recombination happened early enough to affect the outcome, but not completely. The exact value requires precise calculation, but given the options, 0.05% (option J) seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Diluting further would mean adding more buffer or substance, right? So one half is at 1e-7 concentration, and the other is at 1e-5. Then these are plated on different bacterial lines. \n\nThe key here is that the number of plumes indicates how many times the mutation occurred. In the presence of two mutants, the probability of recombination increases. Each plume represents a successful infection by one type of phage. If the two mutants are recombined, their effects might interfere or reinforce each other. \n\nIn the first case, when only lysogenic phages are present, all the bacteria should be lysogenic, leading to the observed effect. When both types are present, some cells might have recombined, causing interference or synergism. However, the result was a significant increase in the number of plumes on strain B compared to K. \n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's a ratio of about 10 times higher. This suggests that the presence of both mutants leads to much more efficient plasmid transfer, possibly due to recombination. \n\nThe formula for calculating the efficiency of a double mutation is often used in recombinant DNA experiments. It's something like the square root of the ratio of plumes, adjusted for dilution factors. The formula is:\n\nEfficiency = sqrt( (P2 / P1) * (1/10^n) )\n\nWhere P1 is the plume density in the first sample, P2 in the second, and n is the dilution factor. Plugging in the numbers: P2/P1 = 40/4=10. So sqrt(10)\u22483.16, but since we're dealing with dilutions, maybe another approach is needed. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the combined efficiency might involve multiplying the probabilities. \n\nAnother way is to consider that the expected number of plumes under no recombination would be proportional to the product of the concentrations. With recombination, it might be additive or follow a different model. \n\nGiven the high number of plumes on B, it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused by the mutant (which inhibits lysogenic fission) affects the expression of the recombining phage. Since the lysogenic phage (from the first half) is present, it may cause the recombining phage to fail, thereby reducing the overall effect. \n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage should kill the E. coli, so if it's present in the culture, it should suppress the growth of any recombining phages. So in the first experiment, only lysogenic phages are present, so all the E. coli should die, resulting in no plumes on strain B. But instead, some plumes appeared, indicating that perhaps the lysogenic phage isn't fully effective, or there's some interference. \n\nBut then, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (from the first half) is present, which should prevent the recombining phage from taking over. Therefore, the effect should be lessened. However, the actual result shows more plumes on B than K, suggesting that the recombination didn't occur as effectively as expected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of recombination, thus increasing the chance of independent mutations. But I'm getting tangled up. Maybe I should look for a formula related to double mutants and plasmid transfer rates. \n\nThe formula I recall is:\n\nq = sqrt( (P2 / P1) ) * (1/d)\n\nWhere q is the efficiency, P2 and P1 are plume densities, and d is the dilution factor. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formulation. Another approach is to use the relationship between the efficiencies of the two mutants. \n\nIf M1 and M2 are the efficiencies of the two mutants, then the total efficiency q is given by:\n\nq = M1 + M2 - M1*M2\n\nThis accounts for the possibility that recombination could lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects. \n\nHowever, without knowing the individual efficiencies, it's tricky. Instead, looking at the ratio of plumes gives an idea. The ratio of plumes is 40/4=10. Assuming that the dilution factors are similar, say 10^7 vs 10^5, the relative efficiency would be 10^(7-5)=10^2=100x. So q \u2248 100x. But I'm not sure if this applies directly.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the efficiency using the formula for double mutants. The number of plumes in the presence of both mutants should be lower than the sum of individual plumes minus their product. \n\nBut the problem states that four plumes are found on strain K, which is probably the lysogenic phage. So the main effect comes from the lysogenic phage. The fact that some plumes appear on strain B suggests that the recombination has occurred, making the lysogenic phage ineffective against strain B. \n\nSo the increase in plumes on B compared to K could indicate the degree of recombination. If there's complete recombination, the number of plumes would be minimal. Conversely, if there's little recombination, more plumes would be seen. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, that's a 10x difference. Using the formula q = (sqrt(P2/P1)) * (1/d), where d is the dilution factor. But I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the plume count reflects the probability of the mutation occurring. \n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If both mutants are present, the probability of a successful infection by either should decrease, hence fewer plumes. But the data shows more plumes on B, which seems contradictory unless recombination occurs, making the lysogenic phage less effective. \n\nTherefore, the recombination must be such that it reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage against strain B, allowing more plumes to form on B despite the presence of the lysogenic phage. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can estimate it based on the observed plume counts. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. If complete recombination is 100%, then the number of plumes would be minimal. But in reality, it's less. \n\nAssuming that the recombination fraction (theta) determines the efficiency. Theta=0 means no recombination, theta=1 means 100% recombination. The formula relating theta to plume counts is:\n\nNumber of plumes = (M1 + M2 - M1*M2) / (d)\n\nWhere M1 and M2 are the efficiencies of each mutation. But without knowing M1 and M2, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, the formula q = M1 + M2 - M1*M2, where q is the total efficiency. Given that, and assuming M1 and M2 are small (since recombination is likely), we can approximate q \u2248 M1 + M2. \n\nFrom the data, the ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1. Let\u2019s denote that the lysogenic phage (M1) is present and the recombining phage (M2) is absent. So the total efficiency would be M1. But when both are present, the efficiency decreases. \n\nWait, actually, in the presence of both mutants, the total efficiency is reduced. So the ratio of plumes (without considering efficiency) is 10:1. To get the actual plume ratio considering efficiency, we need to adjust for the loss of efficiency due to recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the loss of efficiency due to recombination is proportional to theta. The formula becomes:\n\nPlume_B / Plume_K = (M1 / (1 - theta*M2)) / (M2 / (1 - theta*M1))\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutants increases the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes (without considering efficiency) is 10:1. \n\nIf we assume that the loss of efficiency due to recombination is negligible, then the ratio would be approximately the same as the efficiency ratio. But since recombination is happening, the actual ratio would be higher because the lysogenic phage (M1) is now being inhibited by the recombining phage (M2), leading to more plumes on B. \n\nWait, no. If M2 is recombining with M1, which is lysogenic, then M2 would be effective against M1, reducing its ability to lyse E. coli. So in the presence of M2, the lysogenic phage (M1) is less effective, leading to more plumes on B. \n\nBut without knowing the actual efficiencies, it's hard to quantify the recombination rate. However, the options provided suggest percentages around 0.05% to 0.02%. Considering that recombination is a relatively minor event in phages, especially in a region like T_4, it's plausible that the recombination rate is low. \n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is F (0.3%) and the lowest is J (0.02%). Since the problem states that both mutants are present, and the result is that strain B has more plumes, it suggests that recombination has occurred enough to reduce the lysogenic phage's effectiveness. \n\nWithout precise calculations, it's challenging to determine exactly which option is correct, but considering the experimental outcome, I'd lean towards a moderate recombination rate, perhaps around 0.05% to 0.02%. However, the options don't go down to 0.01%, so the closest is G (0.5%) or H (0.05%). Between these, 0.05% seems more reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Plugging in the numbers: P2/P1 = 40/4=10. So sqrt(10)\u22483.16, but since we're dealing with dilutions, maybe another approach is needed. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the combined efficiency might involve multiplying the probabilities. \n\nAnother way is to consider that the expected number of plumes under no recombination would be proportional to the product of the concentrations. With recombination, it might be additive or follow a different model. \n\nGiven the high number of plumes on B, it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused by the mutant (which inhibits lysogenic fission) affects the expression of the recombining phage. Since the lysogenic phage (from the first half) is present, it may cause the recombining phage to fail, thereby reducing the overall effect. \n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage should kill the E. coli, so if it's present in the culture, it should suppress the growth of any recombining phages. So in the first experiment, only lysogenic phages are present, so all the E. coli should die, resulting in no plumes on strain B. But instead, some plumes appeared, indicating that perhaps the lysogenic phage isn't fully effective, or there's some interference. \n\nBut then, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (from the first half) is present, which should prevent the recombining phage from taking over. Therefore, the effect should be lessened. However, the actual result shows more plumes on B than K, suggesting that the recombination didn't occur as effectively as expected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of recombination, thus increasing the chance of independent mutations. But I'm getting tangled up. Maybe I should look for a formula related to double mutants and plasmid transfer rates. \n\nThe formula I recall is:\n\nq = sqrt( (P2 / P1) ) * (1/d)\n\nWhere q is the efficiency, P2 and P1 are plume densities, and d is the dilution factor. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formulation. Another approach is to use the relationship between the efficiencies of the two mutants. \n\nIf M1 and M2 are the efficiencies of the two mutants, then the total efficiency q is given by:\n\nq = M1 + M2 - M1*M2\n\nThis accounts for the possibility that recombination could lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects. \n\nHowever, without knowing the individual efficiencies, it's tricky. Instead, looking at the ratio of plumes gives an idea. The ratio of plumes is 40/4=10. Assuming that the dilution factors are similar, say 10^7 vs 10^5, the relative efficiency would be 10^(7-5)=10^2=100x. So q \u2248 100x. But I'm not sure if this applies directly.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the efficiency using the formula for double mutants. The number of plumes in the presence of both mutants should be lower than the sum of individual plumes minus their product. \n\nBut the problem states that four plumes are found on strain K, which is probably the lysogenic phage. So the main effect comes from the lysogenic phage. The fact that some plumes appear on strain B suggests that the recombination has occurred, making the lysogenic phage ineffective against strain B. \n\nSo the increase in plumes on B compared to K could indicate the degree of recombination. If there's complete recombination, the number of plumes would be minimal. Conversely, if there's little recombination, more plumes would be seen. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, that's a 10x difference. Using the formula q = (sqrt(P2/P1)) * (1/d), where d is the dilution factor. But I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the plume count reflects the probability of the mutation occurring. \n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If both mutants are present, the probability of a successful infection by either should decrease, hence fewer plumes. But the data shows more plumes on B, which seems contradictory unless recombination occurs, making the lysogenic phage less effective. \n\nTherefore, the recombination must be such that it reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage against strain B, allowing more plumes to form on B despite the presence of the lysogenic phage. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can estimate it based on the observed plume counts. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. If complete recombination is 100%, then the number of plumes would be minimal. But in reality, it's less. \n\nAssuming that the recombination fraction (theta) determines the efficiency. Theta=0 means no recombination, theta=1 means 100% recombination. The formula relating theta to plume counts is:\n\nNumber of plumes = (M1 + M2 - M1*M2) / (d)\n\nWhere M1 and M2 are the efficiencies of each mutation. But without knowing M1 and M2, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, the formula q = M1 + M2 - M1*M2, where q is the total efficiency. Given that, and assuming M1 and M2 are small (since recombination is likely), we can approximate q \u2248 M1 + M2. \n\nFrom the data, the ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1. Let\u2019s denote that the lysogenic phage (M1) is present and the recombining phage (M2) is absent. So the total efficiency would be M1. But when both are present, the efficiency decreases. \n\nWait, actually, in the presence of both mutants, the total efficiency is reduced. So the ratio of plumes (without considering efficiency) is 10:1. To get the actual plume ratio considering efficiency, we need to adjust for the loss of efficiency due to recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the loss of efficiency due to recombination is proportional to theta. The formula becomes:\n\nPlume_B / Plume_K = (M1 / (1 - theta*M2)) / (M2 / (1 - theta*M1))\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutants increases the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes (without considering efficiency) is 10:1. \n\nIf we assume that the loss of efficiency due to recombination is negligible, then the ratio would be approximately the same as the efficiency ratio. But since recombination is happening, the actual ratio would be higher because the lysogenic phage (M1) is now being inhibited by the recombining phage (M2), leading to more plumes on B. \n\nWait, no. If M2 is recombining with M1, which is lysogenic, then M2 would be effective against M1, reducing its ability to lyse E. coli. So in the presence of M2, the lysogenic phage (M1) is less effective, leading to more plumes on B. \n\nBut without knowing the actual efficiencies, it's hard to quantify the recombination rate. However, the options provided suggest percentages around 0.05% to 0.02%. Considering that recombination is a relatively minor event in phages, especially in a region like T_4, it's plausible that the recombination rate is low. \n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is F (0.3%) and the lowest is J (0.02%). Since the problem states that both mutants are present, and the result is that strain B has more plumes, it suggests that recombination has occurred enough to reduce the lysogenic phage's effectiveness. \n\nWithout precise calculations, it's challenging to determine exactly which option is correct, but considering the experimental outcome, I'd lean towards a moderate recombination rate, perhaps around 0.05% to 0.02%. However, the options don't go down to 0.01%, so the closest is G (0.5%) or H (0.05%). Between these, 0.05% seems more reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, let me think about what happens during phage infections.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, let me think about what happens during phage infections. Normally, a phage can integrate its DNA into the bacterial genome, creating a prophage. If the phage integrates right before the lysogenic switch (like around the 8kb marker), it becomes a prophage that lyses the bacteria. If it integrates later, the phage remains lysogenic. So, if you have two different mutations, like one causing prophage integration at a certain point and another at a different point, their combination might lead to some cells becoming lysogenic and others lysis, depending on the timing of each mutation.\n\nIn the scenario here, the lysogenic phage probably integrated earlier, causing it to be a prophage and lyse the E. coli. However, the other phage might have integrated later, keeping it as a lysogen. So when mixed together, some cells would take up the prophage and lyse, while others keep the lysogen. That should cause some cells to die (lyses) and others to survive (lysogenize).\n\nNow, the experiment involved diluting the phages. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, which means each bacterium has 10^7 phages. This is very low concentration, so the chance of any single phage taking up the prophage is very high. However, since there are multiple phages, the probability of a cell being lysogenic depends on how many phages integrated correctly.\n\nThe second half was diluted 1:10^5, meaning each bacterium has 10^5 phages. At this lower concentration, the number of possible successful integrations decreases, but more importantly, if the mutations are linked, the presence of both mutations could mean that even a few phages having both mutations will integrate in the same area, leading to some cells being fully lysogenic.\n\nAfter mixing, when the bacteria are plated on strain B, only those that successfully took up the prophage (which is the lysogenic phage) would die. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the ones that took up the lysogenic phage would survive because they are no longer lysogenic. But the results showed that more plumes appeared on K (40) than on B (4), which makes sense because B's phage is lysogenic and shouldn't form plumes, whereas K's phage shouldn't either\u2014wait, actually, lysogenic phages don't form plumes. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Lysogenic phages replicate without lysing the host, so they don't form plumes. So why do we see plumes? Oh, wait, maybe the lysogenic phage integrates into the prophage, so it becomes a prophage and lyses. So when you plate on strain B, which has lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phages wouldn't form plumes, but the phage with the prophage would. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again. Normally, a phage that takes up a prophage from an external source becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. Another type of phage that doesn't integrate the prophage stays lysogenic. In this case, the lysogenic phage (from the lysogenic phage) would stay lysogenic and thus not form plumes. The other phage (the one with the prophage) would become a prophage and lysize. So when you plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phage would not form plumes; instead, the phage carrying the prophage would. So if you mix both types, the phage with the prophage would lysize, forming a plume, while the lysogenic phage would not.\n\nSo when you plate on strain B, which is supposed to kill the lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage (with the prophage) would not kill the bacteria, so you'd get no plumes on B. On the other hand, when you plate on strain K, which doesn't have the prophage, the lysogenic phage would remain lysogenic and not form plumes, so you shouldn't get any plumes on K either. But according to the results, you did get plumes on K. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage isn't directly killing the bacteria but is integrating and taking up the prophage. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage typically doesn't lyse the cell; it just replicates inside. The prophage is taken up by the lysogenic phage and becomes part of its genome, making it a prophage that lyses the cell.\n\nWait, now I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phage: Integrates into the prophage genome, becomes a prophage, lyses the cell.\n- Lysisogenic phage: Takes up a prophage externally, becomes a prophage, lyses the cell.\n\nBut in this problem, the two mutant phages are both lysogenic, one with a prophage mutation and the other without. Or perhaps one is lysogenic and the other is prophage?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of strainK.\"\n\nSo the phages with rII mutations cause lytic fission for strain B but not K. So these are lysogenic phages. Because lysogenic phages don't lyse the cell\u2014they replicate inside.\n\nTherefore, when mixed, the phage with rII mutations (mutant) would cause lytic fission (lyse) of strain B, while the non-mutant phage would not. But in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, suggesting some interaction where the mutants somehow affect each other. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a prophage mutation, allowing it to integrate into the prophage, making it a prophage, thus lysing the host.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the mutant phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. So the rII region is where the prophage integration occurs. Therefore, if a lysogenic phage (without the prophage mutation) integrates into the prophage, it becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. If it has the prophage mutation, it doesn't become a prophage\u2014it retains the prophage.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't have the prophage mutation, it becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. If it does have the prophage mutation, it remains lysogenic and doesn't lyse the cell.\n\nSimilarly, the non-lysogenic phage (without the prophage mutation) remains lysogenic. The lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation becomes a prophage and lyses the cell.\n\nSo when mixed, some bacteria may have both mutations, one from each phage. But in reality, each phage has only one mutation.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nThe key here is to determine the degree of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the mutations are inherited together or separately.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, their recombinants would appear at a specific interval. If they're independent, the occurrence of one mutation doesn't influence the occurrence of the other.\n\nIn the experiment, the result was four plumes on K and 40 on B. Since K doesn't carry the lysogenic phage (as per the problem statement), any plumes on K must come from the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation. Similarly, plumes on B come from the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would not form plumes, so why are there plumes on B? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage that carries the prophage mutation becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. So when plated on strain B, which is supposed to kill lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse strain B, producing a plume. Meanwhile, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would also lyse strain B, but since it's already lysogenic, it might not produce a plume or it might produce a larger plume.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation doesn't lyse strain B, so maybe it doesn't form a plume. Only the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation forms a plume.\n\nSo when you plate on strain B, you expect all the lysogenic phages to die, including the one that became a prophage. But according to the experiment, you saw 40 plumes on B, which is higher than expected. Hmm, that contradicts my previous thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation doesn't cause a plume immediately but requires time to lyse the cell. So when plated early, it doesn't produce a plume yet, and then as time passes, it does. But in the experiment, the plumes on B are formed earlier, so maybe the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation integrates quickly, causing a plume immediately, while the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation integrates slowly, taking longer to become a prophage and lyse the cell, hence appearing later.\n\nBut regardless, the main point is that the presence of both mutations leads to some cells becoming lysogenic and others becoming prophages.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination refers to whether the mutations are located close enough on the chromosome that they can exchange parts. If they are linked, their recombinants will show a specific distance. If they are independent, the recombinants won't follow any pattern.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that some cells died (lysed), indicating that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation caused lysis, while the other didn't. So the presence of both mutations resulted in some lysis and some not.\n\nBut the question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would occur if the mutations are inherited together rather than independently.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation causes lysis, and the one without doesn't, the presence of both mutations allows for lysis in some cases, implying that they have been passed on together.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes on K (recombinant) is 40, and on B (non-recombinant) is 40. Wait, that adds up to 80, but the total number of offspring would depend on how many cells were plated.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial population was divided into two halves: one half was plated on B, the other on K. Each half had 10^7 dilutions, meaning each bacterium had 1e7 phages.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is introduced, it integrates into the prophage and becomes a prophage, lizing the cell. The lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation remains lysogenic.\n\nPlated on strain B, which is supposed to kill lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse strain B, producing a plume. The lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would not lyse strain B, so no plume. However, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation might take time to lyse, so the plume appears later.\n\nOn strain K, which is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation doesn't lyse the cell, so no plume. The lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse the cell, but since K is not lysogenic, it doesn't die. Wait, no, if K is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would remain lysogenic and not form a plume, while the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would become a prophage and lyze the cell. Since K is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would still be alive and not form a plume, while the one with the prophage mutation would lyze the cell, but since it's not lysogenic, it would kill the bacteria. So on K, you'd expect no plumes because the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation isn't killing the bacteria anymore. Wait, but the experiment said 40 plumes on K, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the results. The problem states that when the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is plated on strain B, you get 4 plumes. When it's plated on strain K, you get 40 plumes. So the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation causes lysis on B, resulting in 4 plumes, and on K, it causes lysis, resulting in 40 plumes. That implies that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation integrates into the prophage and becomes a prophage, which lizes the cell, and since strain K is not lysogenic, it doesn't die, so you get plumes on K, while on B, it dies, so no plumes.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is also present. So when you plate on strain B, which is lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would remain lysogenic and not form a plume. But the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyze the cell and form a plume. So on B, you should have fewer plumes than on K, assuming the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is less common.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is much more common because it integrates quickly. So when you plate on B, which is lysogenic, the majority of phages are lysogenic, and the few that are prophages cause plumes. When you plate on K, which is not lysogenic, the majority of phages are lysogenic, but the few that are prophages would lyze the cells, resulting in plumes. So the number of plumes should be similar on both strains, unless the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more common.\n\nBut the problem states that on K, you get 40 plumes, and on B, 4. So there's a significant difference, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more common, leading to more plumes on K.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation integrates more often, becoming a full lysogen, while the one with the prophage mutation integrates more efficiently and becomes a prophage. Thus, the presence of the prophage mutation reduces the frequency of the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation, leading to more plumes on K.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of recombination, we can look at the ratio of the number of plumes on K to the total. The total number of plumes would be 4 (on B) + 40 (on K) = 44. The number of plumes on K is 40, so the recombination frequency would be (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%, which is not one of the options. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes represents the proportion of cells that lize. So the number of plumes on K is 40, and on B is 4. The total number of cells is 84 (40+4=44?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fraction of cells that lize on each strain is 4/total and 40/total. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the recombination frequency is equal to the percentage of plumes on K relative to the total. If 40 plumes are found on K and 4 on B, the total is 44. So 40/44 is approximately 90.9%, which is way above any of the given options. That suggests I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that lize, so the percentage of recombination is (number of recombining cells)/(total cells). But without knowing the actual counts, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the presence of both mutations causes some cells to lose their ability to integrate, i.e., undergo recombination. The percentage of such recombinant cells would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, some cells lose their prophage integration, turning into recombination products. The observed plumes correspond to these recombinant cells.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, more cells would show recombination. Given the results, with 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the majority of the plumes are on K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more prevalent, indicating that the prophage mutation has occurred more frequently.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells that experienced recombination, say R, then the number of recombining cells would be R times the total number of cells. Without the exact numbers, it's challenging to compute R, but perhaps the answer relates to the frequency of recombination.\n\nLooking at the options, F. 0.3% seems plausible, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, D. 0.1% might be too low. Based on typical genetic linkage ratios, a high percentage of recombination would suggest a large interval. For example, a 16% recombination rate (which is 16% of the parental configuration) would mean that 16% of the population has the recombinant allele. But in this case, the plumes on K are significantly higher, suggesting a higher recombination frequency.\n\nWait, but without exact calculations, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact percentage. Perhaps the closest option to 90% is not available, so the intended answer might relate to the frequency of recombination, possibly around 1% or so.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on K is 40, and on B is 4. If the total number of plumes is 44, and the recombination frequency is 40/(4+40)= ~90.9%. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of cells that lost the prophage, which would be the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is 25%, then 1/4 of the cells would have lost the prophage. But without precise data, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutations leads to some loss of prophage integration, which results in the formation of plumes. The percentage of recombination can be estimated by the number of plumes on",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

That should cause some cells to die (lyses) and others to survive (lysogenize).\n\nNow, the experiment involved diluting the phages. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, which means each bacterium has 10^7 phages. This is very low concentration, so the chance of any single phage taking up the prophage is very high. However, since there are multiple phages, the probability of a cell being lysogenic depends on how many phages integrated correctly.\n\nThe second half was diluted 1:10^5, meaning each bacterium has 10^5 phages. At this lower concentration, the number of possible successful integrations decreases, but more importantly, if the mutations are linked, the presence of both mutations could mean that even a few phages having both mutations will integrate in the same area, leading to some cells being fully lysogenic.\n\nAfter mixing, when the bacteria are plated on strain B, only those that successfully took up the prophage (which is the lysogenic phage) would die. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the ones that took up the lysogenic phage would survive because they are no longer lysogenic.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Lysogenic phages replicate without lysing the host, so they don't form plumes. So why do we see plumes? Oh, wait, maybe the lysogenic phage integrates into the prophage, so it becomes a prophage and lyses. So when you plate on strain B, which has lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phages wouldn't form plumes, but the phage with the prophage would. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again.

The prophage is taken up by the lysogenic phage and becomes part of its genome, making it a prophage that lyses the cell.\n\nWait, now I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phage: Integrates into the prophage genome, becomes a prophage, lyses the cell.\n- Lysisogenic phage: Takes up a prophage externally, becomes a prophage, lyses the cell.\n\nBut in this problem, the two mutant phages are both lysogenic, one with a prophage mutation and the other without. Or perhaps one is lysogenic and the other is prophage?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of strainK.\"\n\nSo the phages with rII mutations cause lytic fission for strain B but not K. So these are lysogenic phages. Because lysogenic phages don't lyse the cell\u2014they replicate inside.\n\nTherefore, when mixed, the phage with rII mutations (mutant) would cause lytic fission (lyse) of strain B, while the non-mutant phage would not. But in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, suggesting some interaction where the mutants somehow affect each other. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a prophage mutation, allowing it to integrate into the prophage, making it a prophage, thus lysing the host.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the mutant phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. So the rII region is where the prophage integration occurs. Therefore, if a lysogenic phage (without the prophage mutation) integrates into the prophage, it becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. If it has the prophage mutation, it doesn't become a prophage\u2014it retains the prophage.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't have the prophage mutation, it becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. If it does have the prophage mutation, it remains lysogenic and doesn't lyse the cell.\n\nSimilarly, the non-lysogenic phage (without the prophage mutation) remains lysogenic. The lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation becomes a prophage and lyses the cell.\n\nSo when mixed, some bacteria may have both mutations, one from each phage. But in reality, each phage has only one mutation.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nThe key here is to determine the degree of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the mutations are inherited together or separately.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, their recombinants would appear at a specific interval. If they're independent, the occurrence of one mutation doesn't influence the occurrence of the other.\n\nIn the experiment, the result was four plumes on K and 40 on B. Since K doesn't carry the lysogenic phage (as per the problem statement), any plumes on K must come from the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation. Similarly, plumes on B come from the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would not form plumes, so why are there plumes on B? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage that carries the prophage mutation becomes a prophage and lyses the cell. So when plated on strain B, which is supposed to kill lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse strain B, producing a plume. Meanwhile, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would also lyse strain B, but since it's already lysogenic, it might not produce a plume or it might produce a larger plume.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation doesn't lyse strain B, so maybe it doesn't form a plume. Only the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation forms a plume.\n\nSo when you plate on strain B, you expect all the lysogenic phages to die, including the one that became a prophage. But according to the experiment, you saw 40 plumes on B, which is higher than expected. Hmm, that contradicts my previous thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation doesn't cause a plume immediately but requires time to lyse the cell. So when plated early, it doesn't produce a plume yet, and then as time passes, it does. But in the experiment, the plumes on B are formed earlier, so maybe the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation integrates quickly, causing a plume immediately, while the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation integrates slowly, taking longer to become a prophage and lyse the cell, hence appearing later.\n\nBut regardless, the main point is that the presence of both mutations leads to some cells becoming lysogenic and others becoming prophages.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination refers to whether the mutations are located close enough on the chromosome that they can exchange parts. If they are linked, their recombinants will show a specific distance. If they are independent, the recombinants won't follow any pattern.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that some cells died (lysed), indicating that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation caused lysis, while the other didn't. So the presence of both mutations resulted in some lysis and some not.\n\nBut the question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would occur if the mutations are inherited together rather than independently.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation causes lysis, and the one without doesn't, the presence of both mutations allows for lysis in some cases, implying that they have been passed on together.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes on K (recombinant) is 40, and on B (non-recombinant) is 40. Wait, that adds up to 80, but the total number of offspring would depend on how many cells were plated.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial population was divided into two halves: one half was plated on B, the other on K. Each half had 10^7 dilutions, meaning each bacterium had 1e7 phages.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is introduced, it integrates into the prophage and becomes a prophage, lizing the cell. The lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation remains lysogenic.\n\nPlated on strain B, which is supposed to kill lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse strain B, producing a plume. The lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would not lyse strain B, so no plume. However, the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation might take time to lyse, so the plume appears later.\n\nOn strain K, which is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation doesn't lyse the cell, so no plume. The lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyse the cell, but since K is not lysogenic, it doesn't die. Wait, no, if K is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would remain lysogenic and not form a plume, while the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would become a prophage and lyze the cell. Since K is not lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would still be alive and not form a plume, while the one with the prophage mutation would lyze the cell, but since it's not lysogenic, it would kill the bacteria. So on K, you'd expect no plumes because the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation isn't killing the bacteria anymore. Wait, but the experiment said 40 plumes on K, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the results. The problem states that when the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is plated on strain B, you get 4 plumes. When it's plated on strain K, you get 40 plumes. So the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation causes lysis on B, resulting in 4 plumes, and on K, it causes lysis, resulting in 40 plumes. That implies that the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation integrates into the prophage and becomes a prophage, which lizes the cell, and since strain K is not lysogenic, it doesn't die, so you get plumes on K, while on B, it dies, so no plumes.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is also present. So when you plate on strain B, which is lysogenic, the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation would remain lysogenic and not form a plume. But the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation would lyze the cell and form a plume. So on B, you should have fewer plumes than on K, assuming the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is less common.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage with the prophage mutation is much more common because it integrates quickly. So when you plate on B, which is lysogenic, the majority of phages are lysogenic, and the few that are prophages cause plumes. When you plate on K, which is not lysogenic, the majority of phages are lysogenic, but the few that are prophages would lyze the cells, resulting in plumes. So the number of plumes should be similar on both strains, unless the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more common.\n\nBut the problem states that on K, you get 40 plumes, and on B, 4. So there's a significant difference, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more common, leading to more plumes on K.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation integrates more often, becoming a full lysogen, while the one with the prophage mutation integrates more efficiently and becomes a prophage. Thus, the presence of the prophage mutation reduces the frequency of the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation, leading to more plumes on K.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of recombination, we can look at the ratio of the number of plumes on K to the total. The total number of plumes would be 4 (on B) + 40 (on K) = 44. The number of plumes on K is 40, so the recombination frequency would be (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%, which is not one of the options. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes represents the proportion of cells that lize. So the number of plumes on K is 40, and on B is 4. The total number of cells is 84 (40+4=44?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fraction of cells that lize on each strain is 4/total and 40/total. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the recombination frequency is equal to the percentage of plumes on K relative to the total. If 40 plumes are found on K and 4 on B, the total is 44. So 40/44 is approximately 90.9%, which is way above any of the given options. That suggests I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that lize, so the percentage of recombination is (number of recombining cells)/(total cells). But without knowing the actual counts, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the presence of both mutations causes some cells to lose their ability to integrate, i.e., undergo recombination. The percentage of such recombinant cells would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, some cells lose their prophage integration, turning into recombination products. The observed plumes correspond to these recombinant cells.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, more cells would show recombination. Given the results, with 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the majority of the plumes are on K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without the prophage mutation is more prevalent, indicating that the prophage mutation has occurred more frequently.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells that experienced recombination, say R, then the number of recombining cells would be R times the total number of cells. Without the exact numbers, it's challenging to compute R, but perhaps the answer relates to the frequency of recombination.\n\nLooking at the options, F. 0.3% seems plausible, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, D. 0.1% might be too low. Based on typical genetic linkage ratios, a high percentage of recombination would suggest a large interval. For example, a 16% recombination rate (which is 16% of the parental configuration) would mean that 16% of the population has the recombinant allele. But in this case, the plumes on K are significantly higher, suggesting a higher recombination frequency.\n\nWait, but without exact calculations, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact percentage. Perhaps the closest option to 90% is not available, so the intended answer might relate to the frequency of recombination, possibly around 1% or so.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on K is 40, and on B is 4. If the total number of plumes is 44, and the recombination frequency is 40/(4+40)= ~90.9%. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of cells that lost the prophage, which would be the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is 25%, then 1/4 of the cells would have lost the prophage. But without precise data, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutations leads to some loss of prophage integration, which results in the formation of plumes. The percentage of recombination can be estimated by the number of plumes on",

But wait, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate without causing issues? Or perhaps it's the opposite\u2014when both mutations are present, their effects combine.\n\nThe dilution factors are important here. Diluting 1:10^7 means each plate has fewer bacteria, making it harder for the phage to infect. Plated on strain B's lawn means we're measuring the number of E. coli cells showing the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, the other half was plated on strain K, so measuring the lysogenic mutation in that context.\n\nWait, if both mutations are present, how do they affect the outcome? In the first case, only the lysogenic phage is present, so only the E. coli with the lysogenic mutation should show up. But in reality, only 40 showed up on B. That seems too high unless the phage is non-specific or integrating. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate more efficiently or integrates better, it might cause more plumes than expected.\n\nBut then the second half, which is less dilute (1:10^5), shows fewer plumes (4). So maybe the presence of the non-integrating lysogenic phage reduces the number of plumes because it's not as effective at replicating or integrating. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage usually integrates, so maybe in the presence of another phage, integration becomes less efficient or non-specific, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both phages causes some form of interference or competition, reducing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. If the lysogenic phage is integrated, it may be more likely to replicate and cause issues, but with a non-integrating phage, it's less likely to replicate, thus fewer plumes.\n\nSo, the idea is that the recombination refers to whether these two mutations interfere with each other. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage will behave independently. If they do recombine, their effects might combine, either adding or subtracting.\n\nIn the scenario where both are present, the number of plumes on strain B is higher than expected if they didn't recombine. For example, if the lysogenic phage had a mutation that allowed it to replicate more effectively upon integration, it could cause more plumes. Conversely, if it's non-recombining, the replication might be reduced due to competition from the other phage.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, the expectation might be similar, but if there's a recombination, the number would differ. Since the lysogenic phage is already integrating, adding another phage might reduce its efficiency or lead to lower plumes. So having both might actually increase the plumes because the lysogenic phage is replicated more often despite integration. But in the data, it's the opposite\u2014more plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this backwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both phages leads to a decrease in the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate, so fewer plumes. That would align with the data: more plumes on B when only the lysogenic phage is present (40) compared to when both are present (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when both are present, the lysogenic phage shouldn't replicate as much as before.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it integrate easily, then with another phage interfering, it might be less likely to replicate, leading to fewer plumes. But in this case, when both are present, the lysogenic phage still causes more plumes on B than on K. Maybe the recombination isn't happening, meaning the mutations are independent, so the presence of one doesn't affect the other.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the number of plumes shouldn't change significantly. So why are there more plumes on B when only the lysogenic phage is present? That suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating more when both phages are present, which contradicts the idea of recombination. Unless the presence of the non-integrating phage somehow increases the replication rate of the lysogenic phage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination refers to whether the mutations are compatible. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might have a mutation that makes it more likely to integrate, which might affect its behavior. But if they don't recombine, the phage behaves independently.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to determine the percentage of recombination based on the observed plume counts. The formula used in recombinant DNA experiments is p = (N1 + N2 - N12)/n, where N1 and N2 are the numbers in each control, and N12 is the number in the mixed population. Here, N1 is 40 (only lysogenic), N2 is 4 (only non-integrating), and N12 is 40 + 4 minus the total, which I think is 44. But wait, the total is 84 plumes across both groups. So p = (40 + 4 - 44)/84 = 0/84=0%. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula differently. The expected number of plumes under independence is (40 * 4)/(40 + 4) \u2248 39.6. So the difference is about 1.6 plumes. Then the recombination frequency is 1.6 / (40 + 4) \u2248 0.037, which is approximately 3.7%, but that's not an option here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the number of plumes caused by each type. Under normal conditions, the lysogenic phage alone would cause N1 plumes, and the non-integrating phage alone would cause N2. When combined, they cause N1 + N2 - X, where X is the overlap. If there's recombination, X would be different.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for recombination frequency (q):\n\np = (N1 + N2 - N12) / n\n\nWhere n is the total number of plumes. N12 is the number when both are present. So:\n\np = (40 + 4 - 44)/84 = (-10)/84 \u2248 -0.119, which doesn't make sense. Probably, I got the formula wrong.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of plumes when no recombination occurs is (N1 * N2)/total. So if total is 84, expected is (40*4)/84 \u2248 1.905. The actual observed is 40 (only lysogenic) plus 4 (only non-integrating) minus 44 (the overlaps). Wait, that doesn't help.\n\nMaybe I should look at the ratio of plumes. When only lysogenic is present, the number is 40; when only non-integrating is present, it's 4. When both are present, it's 44. So the ratio of plumes increased when both are present, suggesting that the presence of one phage increases the likelihood of the other behaving a certain way. This might indicate that the mutations are interacting, possibly recombining.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency q is:\n\nq = (R12 - R1R2) / (1 - R1)(1 - R2)\n\nWhere R1 is the probability of lysogenic phage, R2 is the probability of non-integrating phage.

Coefficient of coincidence C = observed / expected. Here, observed is 44, expected is ~1.905. So C \u224844 / 1.905\u224823.1. This indicates that the events are highly coincident, implying strong recombination. High coefficient of coincidence corresponds to high recombination frequency. \n\nUsing the formula for coefficient of coincidence C:\n\nC = [ (R12 - R1R2) ] / (1 - R1)(1 - R2)\n\nWe already tried this earlier and got q\u22481%, but let's see again with exact values.\n\nR1 =40/84\u22480.47619\n\nR2=4/84\u22480.047619\n\nR12=44/84\u22480.52381\n\nNumerator: 0.52381 - (0.47619*0.047619)=0.52381 -0.0225=0.4998\n\nDenominator: (1-0.47619)*(1-0.047619)=0.52381*0.95238\u22480.5\n\nThus, q=0.4998/0.5\u22480.9996\u22481%\n\nSo q\u22481%, but none of the options match exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I think this relates to recombinant endonucleases. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, so when you have a double mutation, the effect is additive. But wait, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate without causing issues? Or perhaps it's the opposite\u2014when both mutations are present, their effects combine.\n\nThe dilution factors are important here. Diluting 1:10^7 means each plate has fewer bacteria, making it harder for the phage to infect. Plated on strain B's lawn means we're measuring the number of E. coli cells showing the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, the other half was plated on strain K, so measuring the lysogenic mutation in that context.\n\nWait, if both mutations are present, how do they affect the outcome? In the first case, only the lysogenic phage is present, so only the E. coli with the lysogenic mutation should show up. But in reality, only 40 showed up on B. That seems too high unless the phage is non-specific or integrating. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate more efficiently or integrates better, it might cause more plumes than expected.\n\nBut then the second half, which is less dilute (1:10^5), shows fewer plumes (4). So maybe the presence of the non-integrating lysogenic phage reduces the number of plumes because it's not as effective at replicating or integrating. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage usually integrates, so maybe in the presence of another phage, integration becomes less efficient or non-specific, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both phages causes some form of interference or competition, reducing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. If the lysogenic phage is integrated, it may be more likely to replicate and cause issues, but with a non-integrating phage, it's less likely to replicate, thus fewer plumes.\n\nSo, the idea is that the recombination refers to whether these two mutations interfere with each other. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage will behave independently. If they do recombine, their effects might combine, either adding or subtracting.\n\nIn the scenario where both are present, the number of plumes on strain B is higher than expected if they didn't recombine. For example, if the lysogenic phage had a mutation that allowed it to replicate more effectively upon integration, it could cause more plumes. Conversely, if it's non-recombining, the replication might be reduced due to competition from the other phage.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, the expectation might be similar, but if there's a recombination, the number would differ. Since the lysogenic phage is already integrating, adding another phage might reduce its efficiency or lead to lower plumes. So having both might actually increase the plumes because the lysogenic phage is replicated more often despite integration. But in the data, it's the opposite\u2014more plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this backwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both phages leads to a decrease in the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate, so fewer plumes. That would align with the data: more plumes on B when only the lysogenic phage is present (40) compared to when both are present (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when both are present, the lysogenic phage shouldn't replicate as much as before.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it integrate easily, then with another phage interfering, it might be less likely to replicate, leading to fewer plumes. But in this case, when both are present, the lysogenic phage still causes more plumes on B than on K. Maybe the recombination isn't happening, meaning the mutations are independent, so the presence of one doesn't affect the other.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the number of plumes shouldn't change significantly. So why are there more plumes on B when only the lysogenic phage is present? That suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating more when both phages are present, which contradicts the idea of recombination. Unless the presence of the non-integrating phage somehow increases the replication rate of the lysogenic phage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination refers to whether the mutations are compatible. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might have a mutation that makes it more likely to integrate, which might affect its behavior. But if they don't recombine, the phage behaves independently.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to determine the percentage of recombination based on the observed plume counts. The formula used in recombinant DNA experiments is p = (N1 + N2 - N12)/n, where N1 and N2 are the numbers in each control, and N12 is the number in the mixed population. Here, N1 is 40 (only lysogenic), N2 is 4 (only non-integrating), and N12 is 40 + 4 minus the total, which I think is 44. But wait, the total is 84 plumes across both groups. So p = (40 + 4 - 44)/84 = 0/84=0%. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula differently. The expected number of plumes under independence is (40 * 4)/(40 + 4) \u2248 39.6. So the difference is about 1.6 plumes. Then the recombination frequency is 1.6 / (40 + 4) \u2248 0.037, which is approximately 3.7%, but that's not an option here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the number of plumes caused by each type. Under normal conditions, the lysogenic phage alone would cause N1 plumes, and the non-integrating phage alone would cause N2. When combined, they cause N1 + N2 - X, where X is the overlap. If there's recombination, X would be different.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for recombination frequency (q):\n\np = (N1 + N2 - N12) / n\n\nWhere n is the total number of plumes. N12 is the number when both are present. So:\n\np = (40 + 4 - 44)/84 = (-10)/84 \u2248 -0.119, which doesn't make sense. Probably, I got the formula wrong.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of plumes when no recombination occurs is (N1 * N2)/total. So if total is 84, expected is (40*4)/84 \u2248 1.905. The actual observed is 40 (only lysogenic) plus 4 (only non-integrating) minus 44 (the overlaps). Wait, that doesn't help.\n\nMaybe I should look at the ratio of plumes. When only lysogenic is present, the number is 40; when only non-integrating is present, it's 4. When both are present, it's 44. So the ratio of plumes increased when both are present, suggesting that the presence of one phage increases the likelihood of the other behaving a certain way. This might indicate that the mutations are interacting, possibly recombining.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency q is:\n\nq = (R12 - R1R2) / (1 - R1)(1 - R2)\n\nWhere R1 is the probability of lysogenic phage, R2 is the probability of non-integrating phage. Here, R1 = 40/84 \u2248 0.476, R2 = 4/84 \u2248 0.0476. Assuming R12 = 44/84 \u2248 0.5238.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nq = (0.5238 - (0.476 * 0.0476)) / ((1 - 0.476)(1 - 0.0476))\n\nCalculating numerator: 0.5238 - (0.0225) \u2248 0.4998\n\nDenominator: (0.524)(0.9524) \u2248 0.499\n\nSo q \u2248 0.4998 / 0.499 \u2248 1.0008, which is almost 1. So q \u2248 1%, meaning complete recombination. But looking back at the options, F is 0.5% and G is 0.5 percent, but my calculation gives ~1%.\n\nWait, did I mess up the formula?

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, I think this relates to the concept of doublerosing or cross-reactivity in phages. Doublerosing happens when phages from different species interact, causing more plasmid replication than expected. In this case, since the same T_4 phage line is involved, we're looking for recombination events where the two mutations interact.\n\nThe formula for doublerosing is generally around 10^-4 to 10^-6 plasmids per million cells, depending on the species. So, if we have two mutations, each contributing one plasmid, their combination should be about 1e-4 M. \n\nNow, let's see what happened in the experiment. The first half was plated on strain B, and most of it was affected\u201440 plumes. That seems like normal interactions without much change. The second half was on strain K, and there were 4 plumes. This suggests that the phages from the two strains are interacting more strongly on strain K. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the interpretation. If the phages are interacting, then the number of plumes would increase beyond the expected range. Normally, you'd expect each phage to cause its own plumes, but when they interact, more plumes accumulate. On strain B, the high number of plumes might indicate that the phages are interacting without being too strong. But on strain K, only 4 plumes are found, which is lower than expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower number on strain K indicates that the interaction isn't as strong there. So, the difference in plume counts could give an idea of the strength of the interaction. If the interaction is stronger on strain K, it means more recombination has occurred between the two mutations in the T_4 phage.\n\nBut how do I translate this into a percentage? Maybe using the doublerosing formula. Suppose each mutation contributes one plasmid, so the expected doublerosing rate is about 1e-4 plasmids per cell. The concentration of phages after dilution would affect this. \n\nIn the first half, the phage concentration was 1e-7, and on the second half, it was 1e-5. The number of plumes depends on the product of the concentration of phages and the probability of interaction. For doublerosing, the probability is around 0.01%, so plumes = conc * 0.01%. \n\nIf the plumes on strain B were higher, it might suggest more interaction, meaning more recombination. Since only 40 were observed on strain B, which is higher than expected, it suggests that the interaction wasn't very strong there. But on strain K, only 4 were observed, which is lower, indicating less interaction.\n\nSo, the difference between 40 and 4 plumes could relate to the degree of recombination. Each plume represents a successful interaction event. To find the percentage, I might calculate the ratio of plumes observed to the expected doublerosing level.\n\nLet's say the expected number of plumes at doublerosing is N. Then the observed number O would tell us how much the interaction deviated. The percentage of recombination would be ((O - N)/N)*100%.\n\nAssuming N is around 1e-4 plasmids per cell, and each plume corresponds to one interaction, then:\n\nFor strain B:\nObserved plumes = 40\nExpected plumes = 1e-4 per cell\nTotal cells in each half = 1e7 (since it's diluted 1:1e7)\nTotal plumes = 1e7 * 1e-4 = 1e3\nSo, 40 plumes / 1e3 = 0.04 \u2192 4% deviation. Not sure if this aligns with the given options.\n\nFor strain K:\nObserved plumes = 4\nExpected plumes = 1e3\nDeviation = (4 - 1e3)/1e3 = negative, meaning fewer than expected.\n\nThis approach might not directly lead to the answer. Perhaps another way is to consider the number of times the two mutations interacted. Since the problem mentions \"amount of recombination,\" maybe it refers to the frequency or likelihood of these interactions.\n\nGiven the numbers, if on strain B, 40 plumes are found, which is much higher than expected, it suggests that either the phages didn't interact much or there's some other factor. On strain K, 4 plumes are found, suggesting that the interaction is weaker there.\n\nTo estimate the percentage of recombination, I might use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Observed Interactions - Expected Interactions)/Expected Interactions * 100%\n\nBut I don't know the exact observed interactions. Alternatively, considering the logarithmic scale, maybe using base 10 logs to find the difference.\n\nlog(40) \u2248 1.60\nlog(4) \u2248 0.60\nDifference \u2248 1.00\n\nBut this might represent a multiplicative factor rather than additive. Not sure if this helps.\n\nMaybe instead, considering the plume density: on strain B, 40 plumes correspond to a certain level of activity, while on strain K, 4 plumes. If the plumes correlate inversely with the square root of the concentration, then:\n\nsqrt(concentration) \u221d plumes\n\nSo sqrt(1e-7) \u2248 1e-3.5 \u2248 3.16e-4\nsqrt(1e-5) \u2248 1e-2.5 \u2248 3.16e-3\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 40/4=10, so the square root of the concentration ratio is 10, meaning the concentration ratio is 100. That suggests that the phage concentration on strain K is 100 times higher than on strain B. Which makes sense because it was diluted 1:1e5 versus 1:1e7.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Maybe through the calculation of the interaction probability. Using the doublerosing formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (Number of doublerosing events)/(Total possible)\n\nEach doublerosing event requires one phage from each phage type. So, if there are x doublerosing events, then:\n\nx = (concentration of phage A) * (concentration of phage B) * (probability of recombination)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the probability:\n\nProbability = x / (conc_A * conc_B)\n\nIf we assume x is small compared to the product of concentrations, then Probability \u2248 x/(conc_A * conc_B)\n\nFrom the data, on strain B, the concentration was 1e-7, and on strain K, 1e-5. Assuming x is similar in both cases, let's say x=1 (for simplicity).\n\nThen,\n\nProbability on B = 1/(1e-7 * 1) = 1e7, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nWait, that approach must be wrong. Instead, perhaps we should model the expected number of doublerosing events based on the concentrations and the known doublerosing threshold.\n\nThe standard doublerosing threshold is approximately 1e-6 plasmids per cell. So, the expected number of doublerosing events is the product of the concentrations multiplied by the threshold.\n\nConc_A = 1e-7, Conc_B = 1e-5\n\nExpected doublerosing events = 1e-7 * 1e-5 * 1e-6 = 1e-18, which is practically zero. But in reality, there were 40 doublerosing events on strain B, which contradicts this.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption about the doublerosing threshold might be incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the experiments work.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of plumes is proportional to the number of interactions. On strain B, 40 plumes; on strain K, 4. The ratio is 10:1, which suggests that the interaction strength increased tenfold on strain B compared to strain K. However, in reality, strain B shows significant interaction, whereas strain K does not.\n\nIf the interaction increases significantly, it implies that the recombination rate is high. To find the percentage, perhaps using the formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (observed interactions - expected interactions)/expected interactions * 100%\n\nAssuming expected interactions are low, but without knowing the exact expected values, this is tricky.\n\nAnother thought: Since the experiment shows that on strain B, the phage concentration is 1e-7, and on strain K, 1e-5, the difference in concentration is 10 times. The number of plumes is 40 vs 4, which is also 10 times. This suggests that the interaction rate increased by a factor of 10 when moving from strain K to B. Therefore, the recombination must have occurred at a much higher rate in the T_4 phage region.\n\nIf the recombination rate is such that each interaction leads to a doubling of plumes, then increasing the concentration by a factor of 10 would require a recombination frequency that allows 10 interactions over the same area. But I'm not entirely sure how to convert this into a percentage.\n\nLooking at the options provided, they are all percentages ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the significant increase in interactions from strain K to B, the recombination must have been quite high. Among the choices, 0.5% seems plausible, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, 0.1% or 0.2% might be closer.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct answer is C. 1.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

But on strain K, only 4 were observed, which is lower, indicating less interaction.\n\nSo, the difference between 40 and 4 plumes could relate to the degree of recombination. Each plume represents a successful interaction event. To find the percentage, I might calculate the ratio of plumes observed to the expected doublerosing level.\n\nLet's say the expected number of plumes at doublerosing is N. Then the observed number O would tell us how much the interaction deviated. The percentage of recombination would be ((O - N)/N)*100%.\n\nAssuming N is around 1e-4 plasmids per cell, and each plume corresponds to one interaction, then:\n\nFor strain B:\nObserved plumes = 40\nExpected plumes = 1e-4 per cell\nTotal cells in each half = 1e7 (since it's diluted 1:1e7)\nTotal plumes = 1e7 * 1e-4 = 1e3\nSo, 40 plumes / 1e3 = 0.04 \u2192 4% deviation. Not sure if this aligns with the given options.\n\nFor strain K:\nObserved plumes = 4\nExpected plumes = 1e3\nDeviation = (4 - 1e3)/1e3 = negative, meaning fewer than expected.\n\nThis approach might not directly lead to the answer. Perhaps another way is to consider the number of times the two mutations interacted. Since the problem mentions \"amount of recombination,\" maybe it refers to the frequency or likelihood of these interactions.\n\nGiven the numbers, if on strain B, 40 plumes are found, which is much higher than expected, it suggests that either the phages didn't interact much or there's some other factor. On strain K, 4 plumes are found, suggesting that the interaction is weaker there.\n\nTo estimate the percentage of recombination, I might use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Observed Interactions - Expected Interactions)/Expected Interactions * 100%\n\nBut I don't know the exact observed interactions. Alternatively, considering the logarithmic scale, maybe using base 10 logs to find the difference.\n\nlog(40) \u2248 1.60\nlog(4) \u2248 0.60\nDifference \u2248 1.00\n\nBut this might represent a multiplicative factor rather than additive. Not sure if this helps.\n\nMaybe instead, considering the plume density: on strain B, 40 plumes correspond to a certain level of activity, while on strain K, 4 plumes. If the plumes correlate inversely with the square root of the concentration, then:\n\nsqrt(concentration) \u221d plumes\n\nSo sqrt(1e-7) \u2248 1e-3.5 \u2248 3.16e-4\nsqrt(1e-5) \u2248 1e-2.5 \u2248 3.16e-3\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 40/4=10, so the square root of the concentration ratio is 10, meaning the concentration ratio is 100. That suggests that the phage concentration on strain K is 100 times higher than on strain B. Which makes sense because it was diluted 1:1e5 versus 1:1e7.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Maybe through the calculation of the interaction probability. Using the doublerosing formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (Number of doublerosing events)/(Total possible)\n\nEach doublerosing event requires one phage from each phage type. So, if there are x doublerosing events, then:\n\nx = (concentration of phage A) * (concentration of phage B) * (probability of recombination)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the probability:\n\nProbability = x / (conc_A * conc_B)\n\nIf we assume x is small compared to the product of concentrations, then Probability \u2248 x/(conc_A * conc_B)\n\nFrom the data, on strain B, the concentration was 1e-7, and on strain K, 1e-5. Assuming x is similar in both cases, let's say x=1 (for simplicity).\n\nThen,\n\nProbability on B = 1/(1e-7 * 1) = 1e7, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nWait, that approach must be wrong. Instead, perhaps we should model the expected number of doublerosing events based on the concentrations and the known doublerosing threshold.\n\nThe standard doublerosing threshold is approximately 1e-6 plasmids per cell. So, the expected number of doublerosing events is the product of the concentrations multiplied by the threshold.\n\nConc_A = 1e-7, Conc_B = 1e-5\n\nExpected doublerosing events = 1e-7 * 1e-5 * 1e-6 = 1e-18, which is practically zero. But in reality, there were 40 doublerosing events on strain B, which contradicts this.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption about the doublerosing threshold might be incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the experiments work.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of plumes is proportional to the number of interactions. On strain B, 40 plumes; on strain K, 4. The ratio is 10:1, which suggests that the interaction strength increased tenfold on strain B compared to strain K. However, in reality, strain B shows significant interaction, whereas strain K does not.\n\nIf the interaction increases significantly, it implies that the recombination rate is high. To find the percentage, perhaps using the formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (observed interactions - expected interactions)/expected interactions * 100%\n\nAssuming expected interactions are low, but without knowing the exact expected values, this is tricky.\n\nAnother thought: Since the experiment shows that on strain B, the phage concentration is 1e-7, and on strain K, 1e-5, the difference in concentration is 10 times. The number of plumes is 40 vs 4, which is also 10 times. This suggests that the interaction rate increased by a factor of 10 when moving from strain K to B. Therefore, the recombination must have occurred at a much higher rate in the T_4 phage region.\n\nIf the recombination rate is such that each interaction leads to a doubling of plumes, then increasing the concentration by a factor of 10 would require a recombination frequency that allows 10 interactions over the same area. But I'm not entirely sure how to convert this into a percentage.\n\nLooking at the options provided, they are all percentages ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the significant increase in interactions from strain K to B, the recombination must have been quite high. Among the choices, 0.5% seems plausible, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, 0.1% or 0.2% might be closer.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct answer is C. 1.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_resampled": "Hmm, wait.",
    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, wait. So when both mutantphages are present, the ones causing damage only affect half of the population. That might mean that each mutation has a certain probability of occurring independently, and their combination determines the outcome. Since the lysogenic phage affects all the cells, and the lytic phage only affects half, maybe the presence of lysogenic phages causes the rest of the cells to be affected, while the lytic phages don't. \n\nThe key here is figuring out how much of the T_4 genome is recombined between the two mutants. Recombination would mean that their effects interact, possibly increasing the probability that the lysogenic phage will cause damage. If they're independent, their probabilities multiply. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 50% chance and the lytic phage has a 50% chance, then together they have a 25% chance. However, since only half of the cells are affected, perhaps the combined effect is halved. \n\nWait, no. If the lysogenic phage alone affects half, and the lytic phage affects the other half, but the lysogenic phage also has a chance to interfere with the lytic phage replication, leading to more damage. So the total number of plasmids replicated might increase due to the interaction. \n\nLet me think about the dilutions. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each cell has 1e-7 phage copies. The second half was 1:10^5. So the concentration is higher in the first group. The number of plasmids replicated depends on the product of the concentrations. But since only half the cells were plated on strain B, which is the lysogenic phage target, maybe the replication efficiency is better there. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes damage, it may lead to more plasmid replication because it reduces the lytic phage. Alternatively, the interaction could increase the number of plasmids available for replication, thus increasing the chances of lysogenic phage replication. \n\nSo the observed 4 plumes on K (strain K) suggest that the lysogenic phage caused some damage. The fact that it happened in half the population indicates that the interaction was significant enough to affect half the cells. Similarly, the 40 plumes on strain B indicate that most cells were unaffected. \n\nTo find the recombination rate, I think we need to consider the probabilities. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability that the lysogenic phage causes damage, and q as the probability that the lytic phage causes damage. Since the lysogenic phage affects all cells, p must be greater than zero. The lysogenic phage being present increases the likelihood that the lytic phage cannot replicate effectively, thus affecting the lysogenic phage. \n\nWhen both are present, the combined probability of damage is p * q. But since only half the cells are affected, perhaps the actual probability is (p + q - pq)/something. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as the probability that either the lysogenic phage or the lytic phage causes damage. But actually, the lysogenic phage itself causes damage regardless of the lytic phage, so the combined probability should be p + (q * (1 - p)). Because if lysogenic causes damage (p), it's already counted, and if lysogenic doesn't cause damage (1-p), then the lytic phage has a chance to cause damage (q). \n\nBut according to the results, half the cells are affected, so p + (1 - p)*q = 0.5. Also, 4/400 = 1%, so p \u2248 1%. Plugging p=0.01 into the equation: 0.01 + (0.99)*q = 0.5 \u2192 0.99*q = 0.49 \u2192 q\u22480.4949. So q\u224849.5%. \n\nNow, recombination refers to the interaction between the two mutations. In genetics, recombination occurs when two genes exchange places, altering the probability of certain outcomes. Here, recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage's mutation interacts with the lytic phage's mutation, potentially changing the probabilities. \n\nIn terms of recombination rates, often expressed as a percentage of the total possible recombination events. If the two mutations are linked, their recombination frequency (RF) would be high. But in this case, the experiment shows that even without recombination, the effect is similar, suggesting weak recombination. Alternatively, recombination could change the probabilities multiplicatively. \n\nWait, let me think differently. If the two mutations are independent, the probability that a cell is damaged by either is p + q - pq. From earlier, we had p + (1 - p)*q = 0.5. We solved for q\u22480.495. Now, if recombination occurred, the probabilities might multiply instead of add. So the expected number of plasmids per cell would be different. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach. The initial expectation is that each mutation has its own probability. Without recombination, the combined probability is just p + q - pq. With recombination, the probabilities multiply. So if recombination happens at a rate r, the combined probability becomes p * q * (1 + r). Wait, that seems off. \n\nAlternatively, if recombination increases the probability, then the expected number of plasmids per cell would increase, making the cell more likely to be damaged by lysogenic phage. But in our case, the overall effect is that half the cells are damaged, same as if there were no recombination. Hmm, perhaps recombination doesn't change the overall probability significantly, but changes the distribution of plasmids among cells. \n\nWait, no. Recombination typically refers to crossing over in DNA, altering allele combinations. In this case, it's about interactions between two mutations. Perhaps it refers to the likelihood of a double-strand break, affecting replication efficiency. \n\nGiven that, the observed 40 plumes on strain B suggest that the lysogenic phage didn't cause any damage there, implying that the interaction didn't occur. Conversely, the 4 plumes on strain K suggest that the interaction did occur. \n\nSo the recombination rate must account for this difference. Let's calculate the recombination rate needed to explain why only half the cells were damaged. \n\nAssume that recombination occurs at rate R. Then the effective probability of damage is p * q * (1 + R). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if recombination increases the chance of damage, the effective probability might go up, but in our case, it remains the same. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate affects the multiplication factor. Let me try again. The probability of damage from either mutation is p + q - pq, as before. If recombination occurs at a rate R, then the effective probability becomes p * q * (1 + R). But I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for combining probabilities with recombination. The combined probability P is given by:\n\nP = p + q - pq + (probability of recombination)\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way: the overall probability is influenced by whether the mutations are on the same chromosome or different chromosomes (recombination).\n\nIf they are on the same chromosome (no recombination), then P = p + q - pq.\n\nIf they are on different chromosomes (recombination), then P = p * q + (p*(1-q)) + ((1-p)*q) + (1-p)(1-q). Wait, that's too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: when recombination occurs, the two mutations are on separate chromosomes, so the probabilities multiply. Thus, P = p * q + (1 - p)(1 - q). \n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage always causes damage, so p is non-zero. The lysogenic phage is present in both groups, but the lytic phage is only in one. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage isn't in the first group; it's the lytic phage that's in the first group. So maybe the presence of lysogenic phage makes the lytic phage less effective, leading to more plasmid replication and hence more lysogenic phage activity. \n\nThis suggests that the interaction between the two mutations leads to increased replication efficiency, making the lysogenic phage more likely to replicate. This would happen if the two mutations are on the same chromosome (recombination), because then they form a heterochromatic region, enhancing replication. \n\nTherefore, the recombination rate would determine the effectiveness of this interaction. To calculate the recombination rate, we can compare the observed plume counts. \n\nIn the first group (diluted 1:10^7), the lysogenic phage caused 4 plumes, while in the second group (diluted 1:10^5), it caused 40 plumes. The ratio of plumes is 4 / 40 = 0.1, which corresponds to a 10-fold reduction. \n\nThis suggests that the interaction (recombination) made the lysogenic phage more potent in the first group. The expected number of plumes would depend on the recombination rate. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage's effect doubles (approximately), but in reality, it's an increase by a factor of 10. \n\nSo the recombination rate R satisfies (1 + R) such that the expected number of plumes is proportional to 10 times the original. Therefore, R \u2248 10 - 1 = 9. But that seems too high. Alternatively, considering the multiplicative effect, if the probability of lysogenic phage replication increases by a factor of 10, then R \u2248 log(10) \u2248 2.3. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for combined probabilities with recombination:\n\nP = p + q - pq + (1 - p)(1 - q) * R\n\nWhere R is the recombination coefficient. But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the approximation that the recombination rate is around 0.05% (option J), but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Now, if recombination occurred, the probabilities might multiply instead of add. So the expected number of plasmids per cell would be different. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach. The initial expectation is that each mutation has its own probability. Without recombination, the combined probability is just p + q - pq. With recombination, the probabilities multiply. So if recombination happens at a rate r, the combined probability becomes p * q * (1 + r). Wait, that seems off. \n\nAlternatively, if recombination increases the probability, then the expected number of plasmids per cell would increase, making the cell more likely to be damaged by lysogenic phage. But in our case, the overall effect is that half the cells are damaged, same as if there were no recombination. Hmm, perhaps recombination doesn't change the overall probability significantly, but changes the distribution of plasmids among cells. \n\nWait, no. Recombination typically refers to crossing over in DNA, altering allele combinations. In this case, it's about interactions between two mutations. Perhaps it refers to the likelihood of a double-strand break, affecting replication efficiency. \n\nGiven that, the observed 40 plumes on strain B suggest that the lysogenic phage didn't cause any damage there, implying that the interaction didn't occur. Conversely, the 4 plumes on strain K suggest that the interaction did occur. \n\nSo the recombination rate must account for this difference. Let's calculate the recombination rate needed to explain why only half the cells were damaged. \n\nAssume that recombination occurs at rate R. Then the effective probability of damage is p * q * (1 + R). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if recombination increases the chance of damage, the effective probability might go up, but in our case, it remains the same. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate affects the multiplication factor. Let me try again. The probability of damage from either mutation is p + q - pq, as before. If recombination occurs at a rate R, then the effective probability becomes p * q * (1 + R). But I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for combining probabilities with recombination. The combined probability P is given by:\n\nP = p + q - pq + (probability of recombination)\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way: the overall probability is influenced by whether the mutations are on the same chromosome or different chromosomes (recombination).\n\nIf they are on the same chromosome (no recombination), then P = p + q - pq.\n\nIf they are on different chromosomes (recombination), then P = p * q + (p*(1-q)) + ((1-p)*q) + (1-p)(1-q). Wait, that's too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: when recombination occurs, the two mutations are on separate chromosomes, so the probabilities multiply. Thus, P = p * q + (1 - p)(1 - q). \n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage always causes damage, so p is non-zero. The lysogenic phage is present in both groups, but the lytic phage is only in one. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage isn't in the first group; it's the lytic phage that's in the first group. So maybe the presence of lysogenic phage makes the lytic phage less effective, leading to more plasmid replication and hence more lysogenic phage activity. \n\nThis suggests that the interaction between the two mutations leads to increased replication efficiency, making the lysogenic phage more likely to replicate. This would happen if the two mutations are on the same chromosome (recombination), because then they form a heterochromatic region, enhancing replication. \n\nTherefore, the recombination rate would determine the effectiveness of this interaction. To calculate the recombination rate, we can compare the observed plume counts. \n\nIn the first group (diluted 1:10^7), the lysogenic phage caused 4 plumes, while in the second group (diluted 1:10^5), it caused 40 plumes. The ratio of plumes is 4 / 40 = 0.1, which corresponds to a 10-fold reduction. \n\nThis suggests that the interaction (recombination) made the lysogenic phage more potent in the first group. The expected number of plumes would depend on the recombination rate. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage's effect doubles (approximately), but in reality, it's an increase by a factor of 10. \n\nSo the recombination rate R satisfies (1 + R) such that the expected number of plumes is proportional to 10 times the original. Therefore, R \u2248 10 - 1 = 9. But that seems too high. Alternatively, considering the multiplicative effect, if the probability of lysogenic phage replication increases by a factor of 10, then R \u2248 log(10) \u2248 2.3. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for combined probabilities with recombination:\n\nP = p + q - pq + (1 - p)(1 - q) * R\n\nWhere R is the recombination coefficient. But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the approximation that the recombination rate is around 0.05% (option J), but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The formula is RF = (number of recombinant plumes + number of normal plumes)/(total plumes - normal plumes). In this case, the plumes on B are 40, and on K are 4.

    "rollout": " \n\nI think this has to do with the phenomenon of phage competition and how the presence of multiple phages affects each other. The idea is that if two phages share parts of their DNA, like recombined regions, then they might interfere with each other's replication. This interference would cause fewer plasmid copies in the population, leading to less competition and thus more plasmids being lost over time. However, since these are mutants, maybe the recombination rate can be estimated from the observed plume counts.\n\nThe formula for estimating the number of recombinants (R) is R = (k / N) * 100%, where k is the number of plasmids lost and N is the total number of plasmids. In this case, the number of plasmids lost would relate to the dilution factors. Since the first culture was diluted 1:10^7 and the second 1:10^5, the ratio is roughly 100 times higher. So the expected number of plasmids lost would be proportional to this difference.\n\nWait, actually, the key here is the relationship between the number of plasmids lost and the distance between the mutations. If two mutations are Rc apart, the chance of recombination between them is approximately 1/Rc. But in this case, we're dealing with a T_4 phage, which typically has a certain size of regions causing issues. However, without knowing Rc, we have to find another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the equation related to the competition between two phages. The number of plasmids lost (k) in the first medium (diluted 1:10^7) should correspond to the product of the loss factor (D1 = 1/10^7) and the number of plasmids lost per generation (n), multiplied by the loss factor again (since the second medium is D2 = 1/10^5). So k = D1 * n * D2. Solving for n gives n = k / (D1 * D2).\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the formula k = (N1 * D1 * D2) / (D2 - D1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the loss factor formula says that the expected number of plasmids lost in the first medium is equal to the loss factor times the loss factor in the second medium times the loss per generation. So k = (D1 * D2) * n, where D1 is the loss in the first medium and D2 in the second.\n\nGiven that D1 = 1e-7 and D2 = 1e-5, so D2/D1 = 100. Then, k = (D1 * D2) * n = (1e-7 * 1e-5) * n = 1e-12 * n. Wait, that seems too small. Maybe I'm mixing up the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is k = (D1 * D2) / (D2 - D1). Plugging in the numbers:\n\nD1 = 1e-7, D2 = 1e-5\n\nSo denominator D2 - D1 = 1e-5 - 1e-7 \u2248 9.9e-6\n\nThen numerator D1*D2 = 1e-7 * 1e-5 = 1e-12\n\nThus, k \u2248 1e-12 / 9.9e-6 \u2248 1e-7\n\nHmm, that's still very low. But we know that four plumes appeared on strain K, which corresponds to the plasmid loss in the second medium. Wait, the second medium was plated on strain K, and 40 plumes were found there. So the number of plasmids lost in the second medium is 40. Since the first medium had 4 plumes, perhaps the ratio relates to the loss factors.\n\nLet me try another angle. The number of plasmids lost in the first medium (k1) is proportional to D1, and in the second medium (k2) proportional to D2. Since D2 is ten times larger than D1 (because 1e-5 is 100 times 1e-7), the expected number of plasmids lost in the second medium would be 100 times that in the first. So if k1 = 4, then k2 = 400. But the actual value observed was 40, which is 10 times lower. Hmm, that discrepancy could suggest a different mechanism, like incomplete competition or varying loss rates due to competition.\n\nAlternatively, considering the loss factors, the expected number of plasmids lost in the second medium is (D1 / D2) times the first. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the expectation is that the loss factor increases as you move away from the mutation source. So the more distance between the mutations, the higher the chance of recombination.\n\nIn this case, the plasmid loss in the second medium is 40, while in the first it was 4. That's exactly 10 times higher. So if the loss factor is 1e-7 in the first and 1e-5 in the second, which is an increase by 100x, why is the plasmid loss increased by 10x? Maybe the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the loss factor in the second medium is 1e-5, which is 100 times higher than 1e-7. Therefore, the number of plasmids lost should also be 100 times higher if everything else is equal. But we see that the number of plasmids lost went down from 4 to 40, which is 10 times. That suggests that either the loss factor isn't just inversely proportional or there's additional complexity.\n\nMaybe the formula accounts for the fact that the same plasmid copy number is lost across the entire range. So if the number of plasmids lost decreases by a factor of 10, that implies the loss factor decreased by a factor of 10. Since the loss factor itself is increasing (from 1e-7 to 1e-5), the reciprocal must be decreasing. Thus, a decrease in plasmid loss implies a closer recombination between the mutations.\n\nTo quantify the recombination, we can calculate the fraction of the chromosome that is responsible for the recombination event. The formula for the fraction (f) is given by f = (k2 - k1)/(D2 - D1). Here, k1 is the plasmid loss in the first medium, k2 in the second, D1 and D2 are the respective loss factors.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nk1 = 4\nk2 = 40\nD1 = 1e-7\nD2 = 1e-5\n\nSo, f = (40 - 4)/(1e-5 - 1e-7) = 36/(9.9e-6) \u2248 3.63e7. That's a huge number, indicating almost complete recombination, which contradicts the experiment's outcome.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps the correct formula is different. Another thought: the number of plasmids lost per unit volume depends on the loss factor. If the first medium is diluted 1:1e7, then the expected number of plasmids lost is proportional to 1e-7. Similarly, the second medium's loss is proportional to 1e-5.\n\nIf we assume that the loss factor directly correlates with the probability of recombination, then the ratio of plasmid losses between the two media should reflect the ratio of loss factors. Since the loss factor increased from 1e-7 to 1e-5 (a factor of 100), the plasmid loss should also increase by a factor of 100. However, in the experiment, the plasmid loss went down from 4 to 40, which is a factor of 10, contradicting this.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the product of the loss factors. Since the loss in the second medium is 100 times higher, the expected plasmid loss should be 100 times higher, but it's only 10 times. Hence, there's an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the loss factors apply across the entire chromosome, not per unit volume. So the relative change in plasmid loss corresponds to the relative change in recombination events. Given that the plasmid loss went down by a factor of 10, the recombination must have occurred at a location that caused this reduction. \n\nCalculating the recombination frequency (rf) using the formula rf = 1 - ln(k2/k1), where k2 and k1 are the plasmid losses in the two media. Plugging in k1=4 and k2=40:\n\nrf = 1 - ln(40/4) = 1 - ln(10) \u2248 1 - 2.3026 \u2248 -1.3026\n\nThat negative value doesn't make sense, so perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, the correct formula for rf when comparing plasmid loss between two media is rf = 1 - ln((k2/k1)^(D2/D1)) ). Wait, that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the loss factor goes from 1e-7 to 1e-5, which is a 100-fold increase, and the plasmid loss went from 4 to 40, which is a 10-fold increase. To reconcile this, the number of plasmid copies lost must have decreased by a factor of 10, implying that the recombination event occurred somewhere along the chromosome that reduced the overall loss. \n\nThe formula for the expected plasmid loss in a region with recombination rate R is k = (D1 * D2) / (D2 - D1) * R. Rearranging for R: R = (k*(D2 - D1))/(D1*D2)\n\nUsing the observed k = 40 (plasmids lost in the second medium):\n\nR = (40*(1e-5 - 1e-7))/(1e-7*1e-5) = (40*(9.9e-6))/(1e-12) \u2248 (3.96e-4)/(1e-12) \u2248 3.96e8, which is a very high recombination rate, impossible under normal conditions.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is entirely incorrect. Perhaps I need to consider that the plasmid loss in the second medium is influenced by the distance between the mutations, which would determine the recombination rate. \n\nAssuming that the loss factor in the second medium is 1e-5 and the first is 1e-7, the ratio is 100. If the plasmid loss in the second medium is 10 times higher, that indicates that the recombination event occurs closer together, reducing the overall loss. \n\nSo, the recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as rf = 1 - ln(D2/D1) = 1 - ln(100) \u2248 1 - 4.605 \u2248 -3.605, which is invalid. Instead, the correct formula should account for the inverse relation. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is rf = (ln(k2/k1)) / (D2/D1)). Plugging in:\n\nrf = (ln(40/4)) / (100) = (ln(10))/100 \u2248 2.3026/100 \u2248 0.023, which is approximately 2%. That matches option F.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The recombination frequency is around 2%, meaning that the two mutations are approximately 2% of the chromosome apart.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The idea is that if two phages share parts of their DNA, like recombined regions, then they might interfere with each other's replication. This interference would cause fewer plasmid copies in the population, leading to less competition and thus more plasmids being lost over time.

Alternatively, the loss factor formula says that the expected number of plasmids lost in the first medium is equal to the loss factor times the loss factor in the second medium times the loss per generation.

Hence, there's an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the loss factors apply across the entire chromosome, not per unit volume. So the relative change in plasmid loss corresponds to the relative change in recombination events. Given that the plasmid loss went down by a factor of 10, the recombination must have occurred at a location that caused this reduction. \n\nCalculating the recombination frequency (rf) using the formula rf = 1 - ln(k2/k1), where k2 and k1 are the plasmid losses in the two media. Plugging in k1=4 and k2=40:\n\nrf = 1 - ln(40/4) = 1 - ln(10) \u2248 1 - 2.3026 \u2248 -1.3026\n\nThat negative value doesn't make sense, so perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, the correct formula for rf when comparing plasmid loss between two media is rf = 1 - ln((k2/k1)^(D2/D1)) ). Wait, that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the loss factor goes from 1e-7 to 1e-5, which is a 100-fold increase, and the plasmid loss went from 4 to 40, which is a 10-fold increase. To reconcile this, the number of plasmid copies lost must have decreased by a factor of 10, implying that the recombination event occurred somewhere along the chromosome that reduced the overall loss. \n\nThe formula for the expected plasmid loss in a region with recombination rate R is k = (D1 * D2) / (D2 - D1) * R. Rearranging for R: R = (k*(D2 - D1))/(D1*D2)\n\nUsing the observed k = 40 (plasmids lost in the second medium):\n\nR = (40*(1e-5 - 1e-7))/(1e-7*1e-5) = (40*(9.9e-6))/(1e-12) \u2248 (3.96e-4)/(1e-12) \u2248 3.96e8, which is a very high recombination rate, impossible under normal conditions.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is entirely incorrect. Perhaps I need to consider that the plasmid loss in the second medium is influenced by the distance between the mutations, which would determine the recombination rate. \n\nAssuming that the loss factor in the second medium is 1e-5 and the first is 1e-7, the ratio is 100. If the plasmid loss in the second medium is 10 times higher, that indicates that the recombination event occurs closer together, reducing the overall loss. \n\nSo, the recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as rf = 1 - ln(D2/D1) = 1 - ln(100) \u2248 1 - 4.605 \u2248 -3.605, which is invalid. Instead, the correct formula should account for the inverse relation. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is rf = (ln(k2/k1)) / (D2/D1)). Plugging in:\n\nrf = (ln(40/4)) / (100) = (ln(10))/100 \u2248 2.3026/100 \u2248 0.023, which is approximately 2%. That matches option F.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The recombination frequency is around 2%, meaning that the two mutations are approximately 2% of the chromosome apart.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

This could lead to some sort of cross-reactivity where one mutation affects the expression of another. \n\nThe key here is to determine how much these two mutations recombine. Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules. In phages, this could mean that parts of their genomes interact, possibly affecting each other's replication or activity. The probability of recombination depends on the length of the DNA fragment involved. Since the mutations are in the T_4 phage, which typically has a certain length, we can estimate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nLooking at the dilutions: 1:10^7 means each area treated with strain B is tested for 1e-7 of the original population. Similarly, 1:10^5. The number of plumes observed gives an indication of the frequency of these events. If the two mutations recombine, the chance that both phages replicate successfully increases because the phage components might bind together, making each other's replication easier.\n\nIn the first case, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (which is usually good for lysogeny) isn't as effective against the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the lysogenic phage might be causing some recombination or interference with the lysogenic phage's own replication.\n\nNow, the number of plumes on strain K (the second group) was fewer (40) compared to strain B (40 too, wait no\u2014strain B had 40 plumes, strain K had 4. Wait, let me check again. No, the user wrote \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B.

So, more plumes on K than on B? That seems counterintuitive because the 1:10^7 sample should have been more concentrated, so higher replication rates. Maybe I got that wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the effectiveness. More plumes mean more successful replication. If the lysogenic phage (from strain B) is replying to the lysogenic phage (from strain K), then when both are present, the replication might be reduced, leading to fewer plumes. But in this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B (group A) shows fewer plumes (4) while the lysogenic phage from strain K (group B) shows more plumes (40). Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nSo, in group A (strain B), lysogenic phage, it's only showing 4 plumes, which is lower than expected if it were being replicated as usual. In group B (strain K), it's showing 40 plumes, which is significantly higher, indicating better replication. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is being repelled by the lysogenic phage from strain K, which might imply some form of recombination where the two phages' DNA fragments come together, interfering with each other's replication.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 2 * q * r\n\nWhere q is the frequency of one mutation and r is the frequency of the other. However, since the mutations are in the same phage, perhaps it's simpler to think about the proportion of double-strand breaks or insertions/insertions. Alternatively, considering the effect on replication rates, the expected replication rate without any interference would be low due to possible blocking or hindrance caused by the other phage's DNA.\n\nGiven that in group A, the lysogenic phage has a replication rate of 4 plumes per million cells, which is much lower than expected, and in group B, it's 40 plumes per million, which is much higher, the difference suggests that the two phages' DNA regions have recombined, creating a barrier that prevents replication.\n\nAssuming that the recombination fraction is such that the replication rate is halved (since 4 is roughly 1/25th of the normal 1 million plumes), the fraction would correspond to a recombination event. Using the formula for recombination frequency in bacteria, which relates to the number of double-strand breaks, the fraction f can be approximated as f \u2248 ln(1/fraction).\n\nIf the replication rate is halved, f = 0.5. Then ln(1/0.5) = ln(2) \u2248 0.693. So the recombination frequency is approximately 0.693, meaning about 70% recombination. But this seems high, especially considering the numbers given.

The ratio R'/R gives us information about the recombination frequency.\n\nIf group A (strain B) has a replication rate of 4 plumes per million, and group B (strain K) has 40, then the ratio is 1:10.

But without knowing R_normal, this approach is tricky.\n\nMaybe the problem is designed to recognize that the number of plumes reflects the strength of the interference. The difference in plume counts suggests that strain K is experiencing more plumes, which implies that the phage from strain K is not being inhibited by the phage from strain B. Conversely, strain B is being inhibited, resulting in fewer plumes.\n\nThis inhibition suggests that the phages have recombined, creating a blockage in replication. The exact calculation might involve determining the fraction of the genome that has been recombined. Given the options, the smallest fraction is 0.02% (option I). However, the data seems to suggest a much higher level of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The number of plumes indicates the success of replication. Fewer plumes mean replication was less efficient. If strain K is showing more plumes, it means its replication was more efficient despite the presence of the other phage. That could happen if the phages' DNA fragments have recombined, making each other's replication harder.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of plume counts. If the replication efficiency is halved, the recombination frequency is around 70%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on the number of recombined sites or the fraction of the genome that has been recombined.\n\nGiven the options, the smallest fraction is 0.02%, which is quite low. However, the data seems to indicate a moderate level of interference, so maybe the correct answer is 0.05% (option J).

    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, let me clarify.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, let me clarify. The initial plate has E. coli strain B, infected by both mutant types. So the presence of these mutants should cause some instability in the bacteria. Since only the lysogenic phage causes lysis, but both types might interact somehow. The division shows that the population was split, leading to different outcomes when plated on each strain's lawn.\n\nWhen they plated on strain B, only 40 plumes appeared, meaning most of the colonies died. On strain K, only 4 were formed, indicating fewer deaths. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage may have reduced the number of lytic phages available, thus decreasing the chance of lytic fission. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is more stable or interacts better with strain B.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many recombinants there are. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the phage DNA and the host genome. If the two mutations are independent, we'd expect some fraction of the offspring to be recombinant. But since the outcome depends on the type of phage (lytic vs. lysogenic), it implies that their recombination affects the fitness of the phage.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more stability (fewer plumes on B), while the presence of lytic phages leads to more instability (more plumes on K). So if the recombination rate is such that the lysogenic phage can hybridize well with strain B, but not as effectively with strain K, this would explain why K is less affected.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage causes lysis. However, if the two phage types are recombining, then some of the phages could be lysogenic and others lytic. In a normal scenario without recombination, all phages would be either lysogenic or lytic, and the outcome would depend on whether they are compatible with the host. But when recombination occurs, some phages become hybrid, which might have intermediate effects.\n\nHowever, the results given are about the number of plumes forming on each strain's lawn. Each plume indicates a single-cell death. So 40 plumes on B mean 40 cells die, and 4 on K mean 4 die. The ratio is 10 times lower for K than B. That suggests that the presence of lysogenic phages reduces the likelihood of lytic fission, hence reducing the number of plumes on B. Conversely, the lysogenic phages might interfere with the lysogenic ones, making them less effective, hence more plumes on K.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phages are more efficient at killing the host when they replicate, then having them present would lead to higher death rates on the host. But in this case, when both phages are present, the effect varies depending on the type of phage. \n\nLet me think in terms of probabilities. Suppose that the probability of a randomly selected bacterium being affected by a lysogenic phage is p. Then, if you have two phages, the expected number of plumes would depend on how often the lysogenic phage crosses the plasmid and triggers replication.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to use the formula for recombinant frequency. Recombinant frequency (rf) is the proportion of offspring that are recombinant, calculated as:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nIn this case, the total number of offspring from both plates is 40 + 4 = 44. But actually, the way the experiment is set up, each half is plated separately, so each half represents a separate generation. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) resulted in 40 plumes on B, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) had 4 plumes on K. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you plate a culture on a lawn, any surviving bacteria will form colonies, and the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that died (i.e., failed to grow).\n\nSo if you plate a certain concentration on strain B, the number of plumes indicates how many of those cells died due to the phage. Similarly for strain K. Therefore, the total number of cells plated on each lawn is equal to the dilution factor plus one. For example, if the culture is diluted 1:10^7, the number of cells per plate would be approximately 10^7 + 1 \u2248 10^7. Similarly, the other plate is diluted 1:10^5, so ~10^5 cells.\n\nNow, the number of plumes observed on each lawn corresponds to the number of cells that died, i.e., the number of cells that were killed by the phage. So if the same number of cells were plated on both lawns, the ratio of plumes would indicate the ratio of deaths. But in this case, the plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, which isn't exactly proportional to the dilutions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original sample was divided into two halves, each half containing enough phage to affect the majority of the bacteria. The first half was plated on B, resulting in 40 plumes, implying 40 cells died. The second half was plated on K, resulting in 4 plumes, meaning 4 cells died. The total number of cells plated on each lawn is roughly equal to the dilution factors plus one, but since both were similar in dilution, the ratio of plumes is directly related to the efficiency of the phages.\n\nIf we assume that the phages are acting independently on the host, the probability of a cell dying due to each phage would multiply. So if the lysogenic phage has a probability p of killing a cell, and the lytic phage has a probability q, the combined probability might be p*q or something else, depending on their interaction.\n\nBut in reality, the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) might be more effective at causing death, so p > q. If both are present, the probability of death increases, but perhaps the lysogenic phage is more dominant.\n\nGiven that when both are present, the number of plumes on B is much higher than on K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective, so its presence increases the death rate on B, while the lysogenic phage's effect is more pronounced on B than on K.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinant individuals would correspond to the number of cells where the lysogenic phage crossed the plasmid, causing some plumes on B and none on K, assuming K lacks recombination.\n\nBut according to the data, when both phages are present, 40 plumes appear on B and 4 on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage caused more plumes on B, implying that it was more effective at causing death on B. Maybe the lysogenic phage is more efficient at replicating and causing death when integrated into the phage vector.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector (the T_4 genome) at a certain rate, say r, then the probability of integrating the lysogenic phage into the phage vector would determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the observed data. If the lysogenic phage is more likely to integrate into the phage vector when it is present, then the presence of lysogenic phage increases the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as rf. If rf is high, then more cells would have been recombinant, leading to more plumes on B. But according to our data, the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more effective at causing death on B.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector with a certain frequency, say r, then the probability of integration would influence the number of recombinant cells.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to compute rf directly. However, the problem provides specific numbers, so perhaps we can infer rf from the observed plumes.\n\nEach plume corresponds to a cell that died. The total number of cells in each sample would be approximately the dilution factor plus one. For example, a dilution of 1:10^7 means 1e7 cells per plate. So on B, 40 cells died, and on K, 4 cells died.\n\nThe ratio of deaths is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is ten times more effective at causing death on B compared to K. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector at a rate of r, then the number of recombinants would be r * total cells.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates at a rate r, the number of recombinants would be r * N, where N is the total number of cells. The remaining (1 - r) * N would be non-recombinant cells unaffected by the lysogen.\n\nFrom the data, the number of recombinants on B is 40, and on K is 4. The ratio is 10:1. Assuming that the number of recombinants correlates with the number of cells, we can set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of recombinants on B is R_b = r * N_b, and on K is R_k = r * N_k. Given that N_b = N_k (since both samples were dilated similarly), we have R_b/R_k = 1. But in reality, R_b/R_k = 10. That suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to increased recombination, but it also affects the expression differently on each strain. Alternatively, the recombination affects the activity of the phage, increasing its effectiveness on B but not on K.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the recombination rate determines the number of recombinant plumes. The number of recombinant cells would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage contributing to the recombinant fission.\n\nSuppose the probability of a phage being lysogenic is p and the probability of it being lytic is q. Then, the probability of recombination would be pq.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates at a rate r, then the overall probability of recombination would be r * p * q.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the recombination frequency can be estimated using the ratio of plumes on the two strains.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is tenfold more effective at causing death on B compared to K. Therefore, the recombination frequency must account for this difference.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates at a rate of r, then the number of recombinant cells on B would be r * N_b, and on K, it would be r * N_k. Since N_b = N_k, the ratio of plumes would still be 1 unless another factor comes into play.\n\nWait, but in the data, the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, which contradicts the idea that the lysogenic phage integrates at the same rate on both strains. Therefore, perhaps the integration rate differs between the two strains, leading to different levels of recombination.\n\nBut the problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, not necessarily the individual rates on each strain. Therefore, focusing on the relationship between the two strains' plume counts.\n\nSince the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, the recombination rate must account for this difference. If the lysogenic phage is more effective on B, then the recombination rate is higher on B relative to K.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate on B is 10 times higher than on K, the recombination frequency would reflect this difference. However, without precise formulas, it's hard to estimate the exact value.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers range from 0.01% to 0.3%. These are very small frequencies, suggesting that the recombination is rare.\n\nIf the recombination rate is low, the number of recombinant cells would be minimal. However, in our case, the number of recombinant cells on B is 40, and on K is 4. If the total number of cells is large, say N_b = N_k = 1e6, then the number of recombinants on B would be around 40/1e6 = 4e-5, and on K, 4e-6. The ratio is 10, as before.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination rate is relatively low, which aligns with the answer choices being in the 0.01% to 0.3% range. Among these, option G is 0.5%, which is plausible.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option G, 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The initial plate has E. coli strain B, infected by both mutant types. So the presence of these mutants should cause some instability in the bacteria. Since only the lysogenic phage causes lysis, but both types might interact somehow. The division shows that the population was split, leading to different outcomes when plated on each strain's lawn.\n\nWhen they plated on strain B, only 40 plumes appeared, meaning most of the colonies died. On strain K, only 4 were formed, indicating fewer deaths. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage may have reduced the number of lytic phages available, thus decreasing the chance of lytic fission. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is more stable or interacts better with strain B.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many recombinants there are. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the phage DNA and the host genome. If the two mutations are independent, we'd expect some fraction of the offspring to be recombinant. But since the outcome depends on the type of phage (lytic vs. lysogenic), it implies that their recombination affects the fitness of the phage.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more stability (fewer plumes on B), while the presence of lytic phages leads to more instability (more plumes on K). So if the recombination rate is such that the lysogenic phage can hybridize well with strain B, but not as effectively with strain K, this would explain why K is less affected.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage causes lysis. However, if the two phage types are recombining, then some of the phages could be lysogenic and others lytic. In a normal scenario without recombination, all phages would be either lysogenic or lytic, and the outcome would depend on whether they are compatible with the host. But when recombination occurs, some phages become hybrid, which might have intermediate effects.\n\nHowever, the results given are about the number of plumes forming on each strain's lawn. Each plume indicates a single-cell death. So 40 plumes on B mean 40 cells die, and 4 on K mean 4 die. The ratio is 10 times lower for K than B. That suggests that the presence of lysogenic phages reduces the likelihood of lytic fission, hence reducing the number of plumes on B. Conversely, the lysogenic phages might interfere with the lysogenic ones, making them less effective, hence more plumes on K.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phages are more efficient at killing the host when they replicate, then having them present would lead to higher death rates on the host. But in this case, when both phages are present, the effect varies depending on the type of phage. \n\nLet me think in terms of probabilities. Suppose that the probability of a randomly selected bacterium being affected by a lysogenic phage is p. Then, if you have two phages, the expected number of plumes would depend on how often the lysogenic phage crosses the plasmid and triggers replication.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to use the formula for recombinant frequency. Recombinant frequency (rf) is the proportion of offspring that are recombinant, calculated as:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nIn this case, the total number of offspring from both plates is 40 + 4 = 44. But actually, the way the experiment is set up, each half is plated separately, so each half represents a separate generation. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) resulted in 40 plumes on B, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) had 4 plumes on K. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you plate a culture on a lawn, any surviving bacteria will form colonies, and the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that died (i.e., failed to grow).\n\nSo if you plate a certain concentration on strain B, the number of plumes indicates how many of those cells died due to the phage. Similarly for strain K. Therefore, the total number of cells plated on each lawn is equal to the dilution factor plus one. For example, if the culture is diluted 1:10^7, the number of cells per plate would be approximately 10^7 + 1 \u2248 10^7. Similarly, the other plate is diluted 1:10^5, so ~10^5 cells.\n\nNow, the number of plumes observed on each lawn corresponds to the number of cells that died, i.e., the number of cells that were killed by the phage. So if the same number of cells were plated on both lawns, the ratio of plumes would indicate the ratio of deaths. But in this case, the plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, which isn't exactly proportional to the dilutions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original sample was divided into two halves, each half containing enough phage to affect the majority of the bacteria. The first half was plated on B, resulting in 40 plumes, implying 40 cells died. The second half was plated on K, resulting in 4 plumes, meaning 4 cells died. The total number of cells plated on each lawn is roughly equal to the dilution factors plus one, but since both were similar in dilution, the ratio of plumes is directly related to the efficiency of the phages.\n\nIf we assume that the phages are acting independently on the host, the probability of a cell dying due to each phage would multiply. So if the lysogenic phage has a probability p of killing a cell, and the lytic phage has a probability q, the combined probability might be p*q or something else, depending on their interaction.\n\nBut in reality, the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) might be more effective at causing death, so p > q. If both are present, the probability of death increases, but perhaps the lysogenic phage is more dominant.\n\nGiven that when both are present, the number of plumes on B is much higher than on K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective, so its presence increases the death rate on B, while the lysogenic phage's effect is more pronounced on B than on K.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinant individuals would correspond to the number of cells where the lysogenic phage crossed the plasmid, causing some plumes on B and none on K, assuming K lacks recombination.\n\nBut according to the data, when both phages are present, 40 plumes appear on B and 4 on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage caused more plumes on B, implying that it was more effective at causing death on B. Maybe the lysogenic phage is more efficient at replicating and causing death when integrated into the phage vector.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector (the T_4 genome) at a certain rate, say r, then the probability of integrating the lysogenic phage into the phage vector would determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the observed data. If the lysogenic phage is more likely to integrate into the phage vector when it is present, then the presence of lysogenic phage increases the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as rf. If rf is high, then more cells would have been recombinant, leading to more plumes on B. But according to our data, the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more effective at causing death on B.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector with a certain frequency, say r, then the probability of integration would influence the number of recombinant cells.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to compute rf directly.

The total number of cells in each sample would be approximately the dilution factor plus one. For example, a dilution of 1:10^7 means 1e7 cells per plate. So on B, 40 cells died, and on K, 4 cells died.\n\nThe ratio of deaths is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is ten times more effective at causing death on B compared to K. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage vector at a rate of r, then the number of recombinants would be r * total cells.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrates at a rate r, the number of recombinants would be r * N, where N is the total number of cells.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, wait. If only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, then why would any plasmids survive? Maybe the recombination allows for new combinations. Recombination typically increases the likelihood of new interactions. So if the two mutations recombine, the effect might be different. In experiments like these, each successful recombination event would produce a phage that can cause lysis in either type. Therefore, the number of plasmids should increase as more recombination occurs. \n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, there are 4 plumes, while on strain K, there are 40. Since strain K has fewer plumes, it seems like fewer events occurred where the phages could lyse strain B. That implies fewer recombination events than expected. Normally, if every possible combination happened, you'd see higher numbers on both strains, maybe similar. But here, strain K has much lower, suggesting less recombination. \n\nThe problem asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. To calculate this, I think we're considering the ratio of successful recombinations versus total possible. Each time the phages recombine, they can affect both strains. Without recombination, only the lysogenic phage would affect strain B, leading to more plumes on B. With recombination, the effect varies depending on the specific mutation. However, since only strain K had fewer plumes, perhaps the majority of the phages didn't recombine, meaning the effect was limited to one strain.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, let's consider the dilution factors. The first culture was plated on strain B with a high dilution (1:10^7), implying few plasmids initially. The second was plated on strain K with a low dilution (1:10^5), also indicating few plasmids. The difference in plume counts reflects the interaction between the two mutation types. \n\nIf all possible combinations were present, the number of plemes on each strain would be equal, right? Because each phage would target both strains. But here, K has significantly more plemes, suggesting that K's plasmids were more efficiently replicated or something else went wrong. Alternatively, strain K might have been under-replicating due to incomplete recombination. \n\nWait, another approach: The number of successful recombinants (successful interactions between the two mutations) affects the number of plemes on each strain. Without recombination, strain B would have many plemes, and strain K none. But here, strain K has 40, which is still significant but less than on B. It might indicate that some recombination did occur, but not enough to fully replicate across both strains.\n\nCalculating the percentage of recombination needed to explain the observed pleme distribution. The formula might involve the product of the dilution factors raised to the power of the recombination coefficient (\u03b8). For example, \u03b8 = (number of plemes on K / total plemes)^something. But without exact data, I'll estimate. \n\nGiven that strain K has 40 plemes out of 460 (assuming 4 + 40 = 44, but actually, the total for both would be more; perhaps I'm miscalculating). Alternatively, the number of plemes per strain is proportional to their respective dilutions multiplied by the number of plemes created during recombination. This is getting complex, so perhaps using a rule of thumb: if the number of plemes on K is about 8 times higher than on B, the recombination rate must be such that 8 = (1 - \u03b8) / \u03b8, solving for \u03b8 gives \u03b8 \u2248 0.125, which is about 12.5%. But looking at the options, 1% is an option. Wait, my calculation might be off.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plemes on K is 40 out of 460 total, which is approximately 8.7%, compared to 9.6% on B (4/4.4\u22480.9). Hmm, that doesn't directly relate. Another approach: The expected number of plemes assuming complete recombination would be the same on both strains. Here, K has more, so less recombination. Using the formula for expected plemes, E = n * p, where n is the number of plasmids and p is the probability. If no recombination, E_B = n_K, E_K=0. But with some recombination, E_B = E_K = n_total * p.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the correct answer is based on knowing that the presence of more plemes on one strain indicates less effective recombination. Since strain K has fewer plemes, it suggests that only a small fraction of the possible recombinations occurred. Calculating the percentage, if the expected number of plemes on K is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: The number of plemes on a strain is inversely related to the dilution factor raised to the theta value. So, if the number of plemes on K is 40/(4+40)= ~8.7% and on B is 4/(4+40)= ~9.6%, the ratio is roughly 1.01. Assuming that the ratio is (1 - \u03b8)/\u03b8 = 1.01, solving gives \u03b8\u22480.125 or 12.5%. But the closest option isn't available except F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses a simpler method where the ratio of plemes relates to the dilution factors. \n\nGiven the complexity, I think the intended answer is likely C.1.5% or D.0.1%. But without precise calculations, it's hard. However, considering that the number of plemes on K is much higher relative to B, and given the options, the most reasonable guess is probably around 0.1-0.5%. Looking back, the user provided options including 0.05% and 0.02%. Given that the effect is partial, I might lean towards 0.1% or 0.2%, corresponding to options J or E.

The difference in plume counts reflects the interaction between the two mutation types. \n\nIf all possible combinations were present, the number of plemes on each strain would be equal, right? Because each phage would target both strains. But here, K has significantly more plemes, suggesting that K's plasmids were more efficiently replicated or something else went wrong. Alternatively, strain K might have been under-replicating due to incomplete recombination. \n\nWait, another approach: The number of successful recombinants (successful interactions between the two mutations) affects the number of plemes on each strain. Without recombination, strain B would have many plemes, and strain K none. But here, strain K has 40, which is still significant but less than on B. It might indicate that some recombination did occur, but not enough to fully replicate across both strains.\n\nCalculating the percentage of recombination needed to explain the observed pleme distribution. The formula might involve the product of the dilution factors raised to the power of the recombination coefficient (\u03b8). For example, \u03b8 = (number of plemes on K / total plemes)^something. But without exact data, I'll estimate. \n\nGiven that strain K has 40 plemes out of 460 (assuming 4 + 40 = 44, but actually, the total for both would be more; perhaps I'm miscalculating). Alternatively, the number of plemes per strain is proportional to their respective dilutions multiplied by the number of plemes created during recombination. This is getting complex, so perhaps using a rule of thumb: if the number of plemes on K is about 8 times higher than on B, the recombination rate must be such that 8 = (1 - \u03b8) / \u03b8, solving for \u03b8 gives \u03b8 \u2248 0.125, which is about 12.5%. But looking at the options, 1% is an option. Wait, my calculation might be off.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plemes on K is 40 out of 460 total, which is approximately 8.7%, compared to 9.6% on B (4/4.4\u22480.9). Hmm, that doesn't directly relate. Another approach: The expected number of plemes assuming complete recombination would be the same on both strains. Here, K has more, so less recombination. Using the formula for expected plemes, E = n * p, where n is the number of plasmids and p is the probability. If no recombination, E_B = n_K, E_K=0. But with some recombination, E_B = E_K = n_total * p.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the correct answer is based on knowing that the presence of more plemes on one strain indicates less effective recombination. Since strain K has fewer plemes, it suggests that only a small fraction of the possible recombinations occurred. Calculating the percentage, if the expected number of plemes on K is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: The number of plemes on a strain is inversely related to the dilution factor raised to the theta value. So, if the number of plemes on K is 40/(4+40)= ~8.7% and on B is 4/(4+40)= ~9.6%, the ratio is roughly 1.01. Assuming that the ratio is (1 - \u03b8)/\u03b8 = 1.01, solving gives \u03b8\u22480.125 or 12.5%. But the closest option isn't available except F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses a simpler method where the ratio of plemes relates to the dilution factors. \n\nGiven the complexity, I think the intended answer is likely C.1.5% or D.0.1%. But without precise calculations, it's hard. However, considering that the number of plemes on K is much higher relative to B, and given the options, the most reasonable guess is probably around 0.1-0.5%. Looking back, the user provided options including 0.05% and 0.02%. Given that the effect is partial, I might lean towards 0.1% or 0.2%, corresponding to options J or E. However, the numbers suggest a slightly lower recombination rate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So maybe these phages don't replicate well on B unless they're somehow compatible.

Oh, actually, the lysogenic phage usually causes lysis, while the wild-type is lysogenic and causes lysis too. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage typically includes a lys operon and uses a sigma factor, leading to lysis. While the wild-type is also lysogenic but uses different factors, like the lambda phage.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The key here is that only the lysogenic phage affects E. coli strain B. That implies that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without causing lytic fission, perhaps due to a recombination event between its own mutation and the existing lysogenic phage.\n\nWhen both types are present, the dominant effect comes from the lysogenic phage. So the presence of mutant phages might influence whether the lysogenic ones replicate or not. If the mutant phage is causing lysis, then the lysogenic phage shouldn't replicate because it would lyse the cell. But if the mutant phage is compatible with the lysogenic phage, then the lysogenic phage could survive.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission. So the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that prevents it from replicating efficiently. Maybe this is due to a recombination between the lysogenic phage's mutation and the mutant phage's mutation.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the mutant phage is present alongside the lysogenic one, the lysogenic phage replicates better on strain B, leading to more plasmids. This suggests that the mutant phage is compatible with the lysogenic phage, allowing the lysogenic to replicate without being killed by the mutant. Alternatively, the mutant may interfere with the lysogenic phage's replication efficiency.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the mutant is plated on B (diluted 1:10^7), the number of plumes (or colonies) is low (40), indicating few successful infections. On the other half, which is less dilute (diluted 1:10^5), this leads to more plumes (40 as well). Wait, no, the first half was on B, the second on K. So the first sample (diluted 1:10^7 on B) had 40 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:10^5 on K) had 40 plumes. Wait, but that seems odd because the numbers are the same. Maybe I got the samples wrong.\n\nLet me clarify: the first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B's lawn. The second half is the remaining strain, also presumably on B, but then it's diluted 1:10^5. Wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So both samples are on different strains. So the first sample is on B, the second on K. Each sample is split into two parts: one part is more dilute, the other is equally dilute.\n\nIn the first sample (plated on B): 4 plumes on B. In the second sample (plated on K): 40 plumes on K. Hmm, why would the number of plumes differ between the two samples?\n\nWait, the initial division splits the culture into two equal parts. Then each part is further split into two, one more dilute and one equally dilute. So each original sample is split into four: two more dilute and two equally dilute. Wait, no\u2014each half is split into two more dilutions, so each half becomes four plates. But each of those four is placed on either B or K.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. When both types are present, the E. coli is mostly affected by the lysogenic phage. So when the mutant is mixed with the lysogenic, the lysogenic should replicate better because it's compatible. Therefore, when the mutant is plated on B (where the lysogenic is present), the lysogenic should replicate and produce more phages, leading to more plasmids. Similarly, when the mutant is plated on K (which lacks the lysogenic phage?), the lysogenic shouldn't replicate because there's no target, so fewer plasmids. But according to the results, when the mutant is on K, you get 40 plumes, whereas when on B, you get 40 plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because on K, the lysogenic isn't present, so if the mutant is compatible, it should replicate and cause more plasmids, but instead, you see fewer plumes.\n\nThis suggests that when the mutant is on K, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate because it's incompatible, so fewer plasmids, hence fewer plumes. But when the mutant is on B, which already has the lysogenic, the mutant may cause the lysogenic to not replicate efficiently, thereby reducing the number of plasmids, which explains the higher number of plumes on B.\n\nWait, but the results say 4 plumes on B and 40 on K. That seems inverted. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the mutant causes the lysogenic to replicate even in the presence of the mutant, thus increasing plasmid load, but I thought the lysogenic should replicate regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutant is lethal when combined with the lysogenic, so when you mix them, the lysogenic cannot replicate, leading to fewer plasmids. However, when you plate the mutant alone on B, where lysogenic is present, the lysogenic should still replicate, causing more plasmids, hence more plumes. But in the experiment, when you plate the mutant on B, you get fewer plumes, implying less replication. So perhaps the mutant is harmful when combined with the lysogenic, so when you plate the mutant alone on B, the lysogenic cannot replicate, leading to fewer plasmids, hence fewer plumes. When you plate the mutant on K, which lacks the lysogenic, the lysogenic can replicate, leading to more plasmids, hence more plumes. That would fit the observed data: 4 plumes on B (fewer plasmids because lysogenic couldn't replicate) and 40 on K (more plasmids because lysogenic replicated).\n\nWait, but the actual data shows 4 on B and 40 on K, which aligns with this reasoning. Now, how does recombination come into play here? Recombination refers to changes in the genetic material during the phage life cycle, specifically the process of integrating the host's mutation into the phage's DNA. This would allow the phage to integrate the mutation, potentially altering its host's response.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is missing a mutation that allows it to replicate efficiently. The mutant phage carries a mutation that complements the lysogenic phage's mutation, allowing their combination to replicate without the lysogenic being killed. This recombination increases the likelihood that the lysogenic can replicate, leading to more plasmids and more plumes.\n\nThe amount of recombination required for this would depend on the strength of the interaction. To calculate the percentage, I'd need to determine how much recombination is necessary to achieve the observed increase in plasmid numbers.\n\nIf I assume that the recombination fraction (recombinant frequency) determines the probability of recombining, and given that the increase in plasmid count is from 4 to 40, which is an 8x increase, I can use the formula for dilution effects. However, this might require knowing the expected number of plasmids under normal conditions.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of plasmids (n) after recombination:\n\nn = n0 * (1 - r + r)^k\n\nWhere k is the number of times the phage has integrated the mutation. For simple cases, if the recombination is perfect (r=1), then the number of plasmids remains the same. But if there's partial recombination (r </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Alternatively, the mutant may interfere with the lysogenic phage's replication efficiency.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the mutant is plated on B (diluted 1:10^7), the number of plumes (or colonies) is low (40), indicating few successful infections. On the other half, which is less dilute (diluted 1:10^5), this leads to more plumes (40 as well). Wait, no, the first half was on B, the second on K. So the first sample (diluted 1:10^7 on B) had 40 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:10^5 on K) had 40 plumes. Wait, but that seems odd because the numbers are the same. Maybe I got the samples wrong.\n\nLet me clarify: the first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B's lawn. The second half is the remaining strain, also presumably on B, but then it's diluted 1:10^5. Wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So both samples are on different strains. So the first sample is on B, the second on K. Each sample is split into two parts: one part is more dilute, the other is equally dilute.\n\nIn the first sample (plated on B): 4 plumes on B. In the second sample (plated on K): 40 plumes on K. Hmm, why would the number of plumes differ between the two samples?\n\nWait, the initial division splits the culture into two equal parts. Then each part is further split into two, one more dilute and one equally dilute. So each original sample is split into four: two more dilute and two equally dilute. Wait, no\u2014each half is split into two more dilutions, so each half becomes four plates. But each of those four is placed on either B or K.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. When both types are present, the E. coli is mostly affected by the lysogenic phage. So when the mutant is mixed with the lysogenic, the lysogenic should replicate better because it's compatible. Therefore, when the mutant is plated on B (where the lysogenic is present), the lysogenic should replicate and produce more phages, leading to more plasmids. Similarly, when the mutant is plated on K (which lacks the lysogenic phage?), the lysogenic shouldn't replicate because there's no target, so fewer plasmids. But according to the results, when the mutant is on K, you get 40 plumes, whereas when on B, you get 40 plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because on K, the lysogenic isn't present, so if the mutant is compatible, it should replicate and cause more plasmids, but instead, you see fewer plumes.\n\nThis suggests that when the mutant is on K, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate because it's incompatible, so fewer plasmids, hence fewer plumes. But when the mutant is on B, which already has the lysogenic, the mutant may cause the lysogenic to not replicate efficiently, thereby reducing the number of plasmids, which explains the higher number of plumes on B.\n\nWait, but the results say 4 plumes on B and 40 on K. That seems inverted. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the mutant causes the lysogenic to replicate even in the presence of the mutant, thus increasing plasmid load, but I thought the lysogenic should replicate regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutant is lethal when combined with the lysogenic, so when you mix them, the lysogenic cannot replicate, leading to fewer plasmids. However, when you plate the mutant alone on B, where lysogenic is present, the lysogenic should still replicate, causing more plasmids, hence more plumes. But in the experiment, when you plate the mutant on B, you get fewer plumes, implying less replication. So perhaps the mutant is harmful when combined with the lysogenic, so when you plate the mutant alone on B, the lysogenic cannot replicate, leading to fewer plasmids, hence fewer plumes. When you plate the mutant on K, which lacks the lysogenic, the lysogenic can replicate, leading to more plasmids, hence more plumes. That would fit the observed data: 4 plumes on B (fewer plasmids because lysogenic couldn't replicate) and 40 on K (more plasmids because lysogenic replicated).\n\nWait, but the actual data shows 4 on B and 40 on K, which aligns with this reasoning. Now, how does recombination come into play here? Recombination refers to changes in the genetic material during the phage life cycle, specifically the process of integrating the host's mutation into the phage's DNA. This would allow the phage to integrate the mutation, potentially altering its host's response.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is missing a mutation that allows it to replicate efficiently. The mutant phage carries a mutation that complements the lysogenic phage's mutation, allowing their combination to replicate without the lysogenic being killed. This recombination increases the likelihood that the lysogenic can replicate, leading to more plasmids and more plumes.\n\nThe amount of recombination required for this would depend on the strength of the interaction. To calculate the percentage, I'd need to determine how much recombination is necessary to achieve the observed increase in plasmid numbers.\n\nIf I assume that the recombination fraction (recombinant frequency) determines the probability of recombining, and given that the increase in plasmid count is from 4 to 40, which is an 8x increase, I can use the formula for dilution effects. However, this might require knowing the expected number of plasmids under normal conditions.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of plasmids (n) after recombination:\n\nn = n0 * (1 - r + r)^k\n\nWhere k is the number of times the phage has integrated the mutation. For simple cases, if the recombination is perfect (r=1), then the number of plasmids remains the same. But if there's partial recombination (r </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. In this case, since one mutation leads to lysis and the other doesn't, recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, possibly causing the lysogenic phage to become more effective when combined.\n\nSo, I think the key here is to calculate how much each mutation contributes to the overall effect. The first half was diluted more (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells were plated, while the second half was less diluted (1:10^5), so more cells were plated. The number of plumes (bubbles forming due to lysogeny) increased in the second half. This suggests that the combination of the two mutations led to an increase in the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage compared to just using either mutation alone.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the lysogenic phage isn't effective, then combining it with another mutation should reduce its effectiveness. So maybe the presence of both mutants caused some interference, leading to more plumes than expected from either mutation alone. That makes sense because if the lysogenic phage isn't effective, adding another mutation might cause it to fail even more, hence more plumes.\n\nNow, the formula for calculating recombination frequency usually involves the square root of the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. But let me think about how that applies here. The frequency of the lysogenic mutation is the proportion of cells that express the lysogenic variant. Similarly, the frequency of the lytic mutation is the proportion expressing the lytic variant. If these are independent, the probability that both occur in a cell is their product. However, when you have multiple plumes, it suggests that the presence of both mutations is causing an increase in expression, perhaps through some form of interference.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes depends on how often the lysogenic phage successfully integrates with the host genome and becomes active. If there's recombination, the integration efficiency increases, so the phage has a higher chance of being expressed and leading to plumes.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Half with 1:10^7 dilution plated on B's lawn.\n- Half with 1:10^5 plated on K's lawn.\n\nThe number of plumes on K is higher, suggesting that the combination of mutations on the K half resulted in more successful infections. Since the K mutation probably doesn't cause lysis (as seen in the initial test), the presence of lysogenic and non-lytic phages together enhances their effectiveness, leading to more plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we consider the ratio of plumes. The expected number without any interaction would be additive. However, with interaction, the observed number exceeds what would be expected if the mutations were independent.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to look at the difference in plume counts between the two groups. On the B side, there are 40 plumes, and on the K side, 4. The ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. This implies that the presence of the K mutation reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage by a factor of 10.\n\nIf the recombination coefficient (q) is the fraction of cells where the lysogenic phage successfully integrated, then the expected number of plumes would depend on q. For example, if q is high, the number of plumes would increase significantly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let me denote f1 as the frequency of the lysogenic mutation and f2 as the frequency of the non-lytic mutation. Then, the expected number of plumes would be f1*f2*(total cells). However, in reality, the observed number is higher, indicating that the product is greater than expected, implying some sort of positive correlation.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (r) is given by:\n\nr = 1 - exp(-2Np)\n\nwhere N is the population size and p is the recombination rate per gamete. But I'm not sure if this directly applies here. Alternatively, the chi-squared test could be used to compare observed vs expected frequencies.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the two mutation frequencies. Let\u2019s assume that the initial expectation without interaction would be (f1 + f2) * total cells, but with interaction, it's f1*f2 * total cells.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Without interaction, each mutation would independently cause some effect, so the expected number of plumes would be f1*(number of plumes from lysogenic) + f2*(number from non-lytic) minus any overlap. But in reality, the presence of both mutations leads to some additional plumes, perhaps due to interference.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, the K half shows fewer plumes than the B half, which suggests that the presence of the K mutation (which doesn\u2019t cause lysis) reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. So the K mutation must interfere with the lysogenic phage's activity.\n\nLet me think again. If the K mutation didn't cause lysis, adding it would reduce the number of successful lytic fission events. Therefore, when both mutations are present, the phage is less likely to lyse the cell, leading to fewer plumes than expected when only lysogenic phages are present.\n\nSince the K half had fewer plumes, the interaction between the two mutations must be such that the lysogenic phage is less effective when the K mutation is present.\n\nNow, to quantify this, let's model the expected number of plumes under independence versus actual.\n\nUnder independence:\nExpected plumes = f1*plumes_lysogenic + f2*plumes_non_lysogenic\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage produces a certain number of plumes, say L, and the non-lytic produces M. But in the absence of interaction, the total plumes would be L*f1 + M*f2.\n\nHowever, in reality, the presence of the K mutation reduces the lysogenic phage's activity, so the expected plumes would be lower.\n\nGiven that the K half had 4 plumes, and the B half had 40, and assuming that the non-lytic phage (from strain B) produces more plumes than the lysogenic one.\n\nWait, no, actually, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it shouldn't produce as many plumes as the non-lytic one. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I got it backwards. Let me clarify:\n\nStrain B is only affected by the lysogenic phage, which doesn't lyse the cell. Strain K is unaffected by the lysogenic phage, but the non-lytic phage (if present) might also affect it differently. Wait, but in the experiment, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage is less effective because it doesn't lyse, but the non-lytic phage might still play a role. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-lytic phage (from strain B) is more effective when present in combination with the lysogenic phage, leading to more plumes. But that seems counterintuitive because the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. So if the recombination frequency r is the measure of how much the two mutations influence each other, then the observed number of plumes would be f1*f2/(1 - r).\n\nWait, that sounds familiar. The formula for interference in DNA replication is I = (1 - f)/(1 - r), where f is the frequency of double cuts and r is the interference. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of offspring with both mutations is P = f1*f2/(1 - r). But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the two mutation frequencies. So, if f1 is the frequency of lysogenic phage and f2 is the frequency of non-lytic phage, then the expected number of plumes would be f1*f2*N, where N is the number of cells.\n\nBut in reality, the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, implying that the presence of the K mutation lowers the product f1*f2. So, the observed plumes are less than expected.\n\nGiven that the K half had 4 plumes and the B half had 40, the ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the presence of the K mutation reduces the product by a factor of 10, meaning that f1*f2 is reduced by a factor of 10.\n\nIf f1 is the frequency of the lysogenic phage (strain B), and f2 is the frequency of the non-lytic phage (strain K), then the presence of K mutation may interfere with f1, reducing f1*f2.\n\nAssuming that f2 is the same across both halves, the reduction in plumes indicates a reduction in f1. So, if the expected plumes were 40 (if both mutations were independent), but in reality, it's 4, that's a factor of 10 reduction. Thus, f1 is reduced by a factor of sqrt(10), because f1*f2 = 40 => new f1 = 40 / f2. If f2 remains constant, the new f1 = original f1 / sqrt(10). But I'm not sure about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of observed plumes = (expected plumes) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere expected plumes = f1*f2*N.\n\nGiven that observed plumes = 4 and expected plumes = 40, then 4 = 40/(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 10 \u2192 r = -9. That can't be right because r should be between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, that suggests a mistake in my assumptions. Perhaps the formula is different. Let me try again.\n\nIf the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, then the observed number of plumes is lower than expected. So,\n\nObserved = Expected / (1 - r)\n\nHere, Observed = 4, Expected = 40.\n\nThus, 4 = 40 / (1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 10 \u2192 r = -9. Which is impossible because recombination rates can't be negative.\n\nThis indicates that my assumption about the relationship between expected and observed plumes is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the observed number of plumes is equal to (expected plumes) multiplied by (1 - r). So,\n\n4 = 40 * (1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. Again, that's problematic because r cannot exceed 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another way: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, adjusted by the level of interaction. So, if the interactions are strong, the product is larger, leading to more plumes.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nf1 = frequency of lysogenic phage in strain B.\n\nf2 = frequency of non-lytic phage in strain K.\n\nWhen both are present, the observed plumes O = k * f1 * f2 * N, where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nFor the B half: O_B = 40 = k * f1 * N\n\nFor the K half: O_K = 4 = k * f2 * N\n\nDividing O_B by O_K gives:\n\nO_B/O_K = (k * f1 * N) / (k * f2 * N) )= f1/f2 = 40/4 = 10\n\nSo, f1 = 10 * f2\n\nThat means the frequency of the lysogenic phage in strain B is ten times that in strain K.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the recombination coefficient r. The recombination coefficient measures the degree of recombination between the two regions. It is defined as the fraction of recombinant gametes formed during meiosis. The formula relating the recombination frequency (rf) to the map units is rf = r * 100, where r is the coefficient.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to connect rf to f1 and f2. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nrf = 2 * arccos(sqrt(f1*f2))\n\nBut I don't know if that's accurate here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, which implies that the K mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage's activity. The level of interference can be quantified by the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence (Cc) is the ratio of observed doublets to expected doublets. In our case, observing fewer plumes suggests a lower Cc, which indicates stronger interference.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this directly to find the recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe a simpler approach: Assume that the recombination coefficient r is related to the product of the frequencies. Since f1 = 10*f2, and recombination occurs when the two regions integrate, perhaps r = f1*f2.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, since f1 = 10*f2, substituting into rf = r * 100, and rf is the recombination frequency in terms of the number of centiMorgans. 1 centiMorgan equals 1% of recombination.\n\nIf rf is approximately r (since r is small), then rf \u2248 1%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, since f1 is ten times f2, the recombination frequency would be around 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options, G is 0.5%, F is 0.3%, etc., and D is 0.02%. Option C is 1.5%, which is close to 1%. So, tentatively, I'd choose G, but I'm not fully certain.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination coefficient. So, if O_B is four times O_K, the recombination coefficient is 1/4, which is 0.25. But that doesn't match any option except E, which is 0.05. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio is 4:1, then the reciprocal is 1:4, which would correspond to a recombination coefficient of 0.25, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is G, 0.5%, because if f1 is ten times f2, and rf = r, then rf is approximately 1%, but none of the options exactly match that. However, option C is 1.5%, which is closer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interference:\n\nInterference = 1 - (Observed / Expected)\n\nSo, Observed = 4, Expected = 40 \u2192 Interference = 1 - (4/40) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nThen, the formula for interference is I = e^{-r}, where r is the interference coefficient. Taking natural logarithm:\n\nln(I) = -r \u2192 r = -ln(I)\n\nr = -ln(0.9) \u2248 0.10536.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this relates to recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is typically measured in percentage points, where rf = r * 100. So, rf \u2248 10.536%, which is close to option E (0.05%) or option G (0.5%). None of the options are near 10%, so perhaps this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, indicating that the K mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage's activity. The level of interference can be estimated by the coefficient of coincidence, which is observed doublets divided by expected doublets. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the conflicting approaches, I'll go with option G (0.5%), assuming that the recombination coefficient is approximately 0.5% based on the observed plume counts.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, if f1 is the frequency of lysogenic phage and f2 is the frequency of non-lytic phage, then the expected number of plumes would be f1*f2*N, where N is the number of cells.\n\nBut in reality, the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, implying that the presence of the K mutation lowers the product f1*f2. So, the observed plumes are less than expected.\n\nGiven that the K half had 4 plumes and the B half had 40, the ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the presence of the K mutation reduces the product by a factor of 10, meaning that f1*f2 is reduced by a factor of 10.\n\nIf f1 is the frequency of the lysogenic phage (strain B), and f2 is the frequency of the non-lytic phage (strain K), then the presence of K mutation may interfere with f1, reducing f1*f2.\n\nAssuming that f2 is the same across both halves, the reduction in plumes indicates a reduction in f1. So, if the expected plumes were 40 (if both mutations were independent), but in reality, it's 4, that's a factor of 10 reduction. Thus, f1 is reduced by a factor of sqrt(10), because f1*f2 = 40 => new f1 = 40 / f2. If f2 remains constant, the new f1 = original f1 / sqrt(10). But I'm not sure about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of observed plumes = (expected plumes) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere expected plumes = f1*f2*N.\n\nGiven that observed plumes = 4 and expected plumes = 40, then 4 = 40/(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 10 \u2192 r = -9. That can't be right because r should be between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, that suggests a mistake in my assumptions. Perhaps the formula is different. Let me try again.\n\nIf the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, then the observed number of plumes is lower than expected. So,\n\nObserved = Expected / (1 - r)\n\nHere, Observed = 4, Expected = 40.\n\nThus, 4 = 40 / (1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 10 \u2192 r = -9. Which is impossible because recombination rates can't be negative.\n\nThis indicates that my assumption about the relationship between expected and observed plumes is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the observed number of plumes is equal to (expected plumes) multiplied by (1 - r). So,\n\n4 = 40 * (1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. Again, that's problematic because r cannot exceed 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another way: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, adjusted by the level of interaction. So, if the interactions are strong, the product is larger, leading to more plumes.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nf1 = frequency of lysogenic phage in strain B.\n\nf2 = frequency of non-lytic phage in strain K.\n\nWhen both are present, the observed plumes O = k * f1 * f2 * N, where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nFor the B half: O_B = 40 = k * f1 * N\n\nFor the K half: O_K = 4 = k * f2 * N\n\nDividing O_B by O_K gives:\n\nO_B/O_K = (k * f1 * N) / (k * f2 * N) )= f1/f2 = 40/4 = 10\n\nSo, f1 = 10 * f2\n\nThat means the frequency of the lysogenic phage in strain B is ten times that in strain K.\n\nNow, I need to relate this to the recombination coefficient r. The recombination coefficient measures the degree of recombination between the two regions. It is defined as the fraction of recombinant gametes formed during meiosis. The formula relating the recombination frequency (rf) to the map units is rf = r * 100, where r is the coefficient.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to connect rf to f1 and f2. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nrf = 2 * arccos(sqrt(f1*f2))\n\nBut I don't know if that's accurate here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, which implies that the K mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage's activity. The level of interference can be quantified by the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence (Cc) is the ratio of observed doublets to expected doublets. In our case, observing fewer plumes suggests a lower Cc, which indicates stronger interference.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this directly to find the recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe a simpler approach: Assume that the recombination coefficient r is related to the product of the frequencies. Since f1 = 10*f2, and recombination occurs when the two regions integrate, perhaps r = f1*f2.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, since f1 = 10*f2, substituting into rf = r * 100, and rf is the recombination frequency in terms of the number of centiMorgans. 1 centiMorgan equals 1% of recombination.\n\nIf rf is approximately r (since r is small), then rf \u2248 1%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, since f1 is ten times f2, the recombination frequency would be around 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options, G is 0.5%, F is 0.3%, etc., and D is 0.02%. Option C is 1.5%, which is close to 1%. So, tentatively, I'd choose G, but I'm not fully certain.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination coefficient. So, if O_B is four times O_K, the recombination coefficient is 1/4, which is 0.25. But that doesn't match any option except E, which is 0.05. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio is 4:1, then the reciprocal is 1:4, which would correspond to a recombination coefficient of 0.25, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is G, 0.5%, because if f1 is ten times f2, and rf = r, then rf is approximately 1%, but none of the options exactly match that. However, option C is 1.5%, which is closer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interference:\n\nInterference = 1 - (Observed / Expected)\n\nSo, Observed = 4, Expected = 40 \u2192 Interference = 1 - (4/40) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nThen, the formula for interference is I = e^{-r}, where r is the interference coefficient. Taking natural logarithm:\n\nln(I) = -r \u2192 r = -ln(I)\n\nr = -ln(0.9) \u2248 0.10536.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this relates to recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is typically measured in percentage points, where rf = r * 100. So, rf \u2248 10.536%, which is close to option E (0.05%) or option G (0.5%). None of the options are near 10%, so perhaps this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the K mutation reduces the number of plumes, indicating that the K mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage's activity. The level of interference can be estimated by the coefficient of coincidence, which is observed doublets divided by expected doublets. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the conflicting approaches, I'll go with option G (0.5%), assuming that the recombination coefficient is approximately 0.5% based on the observed plume counts.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. If only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, then why would the lysogenic phage affect the other strain? Maybe it's about how these phages interact during replication. So if they have recombined, perhaps their replication mechanisms are interfering with each other. \n\nThe key point here is the number of plumes observed. In the first half, dilute at 1:10^7, and in the second half, at 1:10^5. This suggests that the replication or expression of one mutation depends on the presence of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage uses a different transcript from the lysogenic phage, then its expression might be influenced by the lysogenic phage's presence. Alternatively, maybe they have overlapping promoter regions where their activity is interdependent. \n\nIn the absence of recombination, you'd expect each mutation to act independently, leading to more random distribution of plumes. However, since we see fewer plumes on K than expected under independence, it implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage (the one causing lysosis) affects the expression of the lysogenic phage itself. That could happen if they share a promoter region, making their expression dependent on each other. \n\nNow, considering the concentrations: the first half was diluted 1:10^7, and the second half at 1:10^5. If there's a functional linkage between the two mutations, the concentration required for each mutation to cause a plume might change. At higher concentrations (lower dilution), the effect of one mutation might dominate over the other, leading to less total plumes. Since the lysogenic phage caused more issues on strain B (which had all plumes due to its own mutation), but when mixed, it reduced the effect on strain K, indicating that the lysogenic phage affects the lysogenic phage's expression.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, I think it relates to the likelihood that the two mutations interact. If there's no recombination, each mutation would occur independently. Here, the presence of one mutation affects the occurrence of the other. So, the number of plumes indicates that the lysogenic phage used has a lower chance of being expressed when the lysogenic phage is present. \n\nIf recombination is complete, all copies of the phage would carry the same mutation, so their behavior would be identical. If there's partial recombination, some phages would carry one mutation, others another. The exact calculation might involve using the formula for recombination frequency, which is related to the number of recombinant individuals. \n\nLooking at the data, the expectation without recombination would lead to certain numbers of plumes. With recombination, the actual count changes. The difference between what happened and the expected value gives an indication of the degree of recombination. \n\nGiven the high number of plumes on K compared to B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage's expression is inhibited when the lysogenic phage is present. This inhibitory effect likely comes from a recombination event where their promoters are linked, so the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate or express is dependent on the presence of another lysogenic phage. \n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, I might consider the ratio of the number of plumes on K relative to the expectation under independent events. The expectation under no recombination would be something like 40 plumes on B (if each cell expresses the lysogenic phage once), but when recombining, some cells don't express it as much. \n\nAlternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness of fit could help determine whether the observed plume counts match an expected independent distribution. The degrees of freedom would depend on the number of categories minus one. \n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to note that the presence of one lysogenic phage reduces the probability of another lysogenic phage causing a plume, implying a low level of recombination. Given the options provided, 0.05% seems very low, but looking back at the possible answers, 0.05% isn't listed except as option F. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the options include 0.05%, which is option F. But earlier calculations suggested something around 0.02%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me think again. If the concentration of the lysogenic phage is lower (diluted 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5), and the lysogenic phage can only cause a plume if another lysogenic phage is also present, then the presence of one phage might influence the other. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is small, say 0.02%, that means most of the time, the lysogenic phage will carry both mutations, so their activity is independent. But when the concentration is lower, there's a chance that the lysogenic phage carries just one mutation, affecting the other. \n\nSo the expected number of plumes would decrease when recombination occurs. The observed plumes on K were 40 instead of 400 (assuming 1000 bacteria). If there was no recombination, each cell would produce one plume. But with recombination, some cells don't produce plumes because one mutation prevents replication or expression of the other. \n\nUsing the Poisson approximation, the expected number of plumes would be \u03bb = n * p, where p is the probability of a plume occurring. Without recombination, p=1, so \u03bb=400. With recombination, p decreases. Using the observed \u03bb=40, p=40/400=0.1. The recombination frequency is calculated as 1 - p, so 90%. Wait, that can't be right because the answer choices go up to 5%.\n\nI must have messed up the interpretation. Perhaps the correct way is to use the formula for recombination frequency (f), which is given by:\n\nf = (p + q - 2pq)/(1 - pq)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinant individuals is given by the product of the frequencies of each allele. If recombination is complete, all offspring carry both alleles; otherwise, some carry none, and others carry one. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the expected number of recombinants: E = n * p1 * p2, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each allele. But without knowing the allele frequencies, this might not apply directly.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to recognize that the presence of one mutation (lysogenic) affects the expression of the other. The number of plumes observed can indicate the degree of interference. If there's no interference, each mutation acts independently, leading to more plumes. With some interference, fewer plumes. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes on K, while normally it would cause 400 (assuming 1000 bacteria), the reduction suggests that 960 plumes were absent due to the lysogenic phage not expressing its lysogen. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's expression is dependent on another phage, indicating a low level of recombination. \n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nf = (number of recombinant individuals / total number of individuals)\n\nBut without knowing the specific distribution, it's tricky. Alternatively, using the chi-square test comparing observed and expected values. \n\nAssuming that under no recombination, the expected number of plumes on K would be similar to the number produced by the lysogenic phage alone, which is 400. But with recombination, some cells don't express the lysogenic phage, reducing the plume count. \n\nIf the observed plumes are 40, which is 10 times fewer than expected, that suggests significant interference. The formula for interference is:\n\nInterference = 1 - (observed / expected)\n\nWhich would give 0.9, indicating strong interference. But wait, that can't be because the answer choices suggest lower percentages.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nCOI = observed / expected\n\nIf COI > 1, there's positive interference, meaning the presence of one mutation affects the occurrence of the other. \n\nHere, observed is 40, expected is 400, so COI is 0.1. Positive interference suggests that the lysogenic phage's expression is affected by the presence of another lysogenic phage, which likely means a low level of recombination.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (number of double mutants) / (expected number of double mutants)\n\nBut in our case, the number of double mutants might be zero or negligible, making COI close to zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nPerhaps another approach: The number of plumes detected on K is proportional to the number of cells that did not express the lysogenic phage. If there's a functional linkage, the number of such cells would be lower than expected, indicating incomplete recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes can be modeled as:\n\nNumber of plumes = Total cells \u00d7 (1 - r)\n\nWhere r is the recombination fraction. If r is small, this explains the lower number of plumes.\n\nGiven that, if the number of plumes is 40 out of 1000 cells, then 40 = 1000 \u00d7 (1 - r). Solving for r gives r = 0.96. But that contradicts the previous thought about interference. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The number of plumes should relate to the number of cells that have the mutation. If there's a functional linkage, fewer cells will carry the mutation, thus fewer plumes. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage's mutation is lost when combined with another lysogenic phage, the expected number of plumes would decrease. The formula for the expected number of plumes would be:\n\nExpected plumes = Total cells \u00d7 (1 - r)\n\nWhere r is the proportion of cells that have the mutation due to recombination.\n\nFrom the data, on K, 40 plumes out of 1000 cells. So,\n\n40 = 1000 \u00d7 (1 - r)\n=> 1 - r = 0.04\n=> r = 0.96\n\nThis suggests that 96% of the cells have the mutation, indicating complete recombination. But that's inconsistent with the previous reasoning where recombination led to fewer plumes. \n\nWait, I'm misunderstanding the relationship. Actually, if the lysogenic phage loses its mutation when recombined, the number of plumes would decrease. So, the observed number of plumes (40) corresponds to the number of cells that successfully lost the mutation due to recombination. \n\nThus, the expected number of plumes without recombination would be 1000 \u00d7 1 = 1000. But with recombination, the expected number would be lower. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. If recombination occurred, some cells would lose the mutation, leading to fewer plumes. So, the observed number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that lost the mutation.\n\nTherefore, r = 1 - (plumes / total cells) = 1 - (40/1000) = 0.96. But that would imply complete recombination, which conflicts with the observation that the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, suggesting minimal recombination.\n\nI must be mixing up concepts here. Let me look for a simpler approach. The problem states that when both types of mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is dominant in causing the issue in strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage is expressing its lysogen even without the other mutation. \n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is present in a mixed population, the presence of the other lysogenic phage may interfere with its expression, leading to fewer plumes on strain K. The exact impact can be quantified by calculating the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (Observed double mutants) / (Expected double mutants)\n\nBut in this case, double mutants might be rare. Alternatively, using the formula:\n\nCOI = (Number of plumes observed on K) / (Number of plumes expected without recombination)\n\nWithout recombination, each lysogenic phage would produce a plume every cell. So, with 1000 cells, that's 1000 plumes. But with recombination, only 40 plumes are observed on K, so COI = 40 / 1000 = 0.04. This indicates some interference, meaning the presence of one lysogenic phage affects the production of the other.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (Number of double mutants) / (Expected number of double mutants)\n\nBut in this context, double mutants might not exist, so COI \u2248 1, indicating no interference. Wait, that doesn't align with the observed 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for interference is:\n\nInterference = 1 - (Observed / Expected)\n\nWhich would be 1 - (40/1000) = 0.96, indicating strong interference. This suggests that the presence of one lysogenic phage affects the expression of the other, indicating a low level of recombination.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is a measure of interference. It ranges from 0 (no interference) to 1 (complete interference). A COI </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

If there's a functional linkage, the number of such cells would be lower than expected, indicating incomplete recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes can be modeled as:\n\nNumber of plumes = Total cells \u00d7 (1 - r)\n\nWhere r is the recombination fraction. If r is small, this explains the lower number of plumes.\n\nGiven that, if the number of plumes is 40 out of 1000 cells, then 40 = 1000 \u00d7 (1 - r). Solving for r gives r = 0.96. But that contradicts the previous thought about interference. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The number of plumes should relate to the number of cells that have the mutation. If there's a functional linkage, fewer cells will carry the mutation, thus fewer plumes. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage's mutation is lost when combined with another lysogenic phage, the expected number of plumes would decrease. The formula for the expected number of plumes would be:\n\nExpected plumes = Total cells \u00d7 (1 - r)\n\nWhere r is the proportion of cells that have the mutation due to recombination.\n\nFrom the data, on K, 40 plumes out of 1000 cells. So,\n\n40 = 1000 \u00d7 (1 - r)\n=> 1 - r = 0.04\n=> r = 0.96\n\nThis suggests that 96% of the cells have the mutation, indicating complete recombination. But that's inconsistent with the previous reasoning where recombination led to fewer plumes. \n\nWait, I'm misunderstanding the relationship. Actually, if the lysogenic phage loses its mutation when recombined, the number of plumes would decrease. So, the observed number of plumes (40) corresponds to the number of cells that successfully lost the mutation due to recombination. \n\nThus, the expected number of plumes without recombination would be 1000 \u00d7 1 = 1000. But with recombination, the expected number would be lower. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. If recombination occurred, some cells would lose the mutation, leading to fewer plumes. So, the observed number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that lost the mutation.\n\nTherefore, r = 1 - (plumes / total cells) = 1 - (40/1000) = 0.96. But that would imply complete recombination, which conflicts with the observation that the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, suggesting minimal recombination.\n\nI must be mixing up concepts here. Let me look for a simpler approach. The problem states that when both types of mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is dominant in causing the issue in strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage is expressing its lysogen even without the other mutation. \n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is present in a mixed population, the presence of the other lysogenic phage may interfere with its expression, leading to fewer plumes on strain K. The exact impact can be quantified by calculating the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (Observed double mutants) / (Expected double mutants)\n\nBut in this case, double mutants might be rare. Alternatively, using the formula:\n\nCOI = (Number of plumes observed on K) / (Number of plumes expected without recombination)\n\nWithout recombination, each lysogenic phage would produce a plume every cell. So, with 1000 cells, that's 1000 plumes. But with recombination, only 40 plumes are observed on K, so COI = 40 / 1000 = 0.04. This indicates some interference, meaning the presence of one lysogenic phage affects the production of the other.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (Number of double mutants) / (Expected number of double mutants)\n\nBut in this context, double mutants might not exist, so COI \u2248 1, indicating no interference. Wait, that doesn't align with the observed 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for interference is:\n\nInterference = 1 - (Observed / Expected)\n\nWhich would be 1 - (40/1000) = 0.96, indicating strong interference. This suggests that the presence of one lysogenic phage affects the expression of the other, indicating a low level of recombination.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is a measure of interference. It ranges from 0 (no interference) to 1 (complete interference). A COI </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

This indicates that the mutation in strain K somehow prevents the lysogenic effect from being expressed by the lysogenic phage in strain B. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage cannot replicate effectively due to the presence of the mutation in K, leading to reduced or no lysis.\n\nIn recombinational genetics, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In phages, if two mutations are present, the resulting phage may have a different range of activity depending on whether the mutations are present in each phage type. The degree of recombination can be determined by how much the mutations interact.\n\nThe number of surviving plumes (4 vs. 40) gives an indication of the effectiveness of each phage in their respective environments. Strain K has fewer plumes, meaning its phage didn't successfully infect and lyse the E. coli cells as much as strain B. So the mutation in K probably affects the lysogenic phage's ability to integrate into E. coli, causing it to die even when it should be alive.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we consider how often the two mutations interact. If both mutations occur independently, the probability that they both contribute to the same outcome would depend on their individual probabilities. However, since the problem states that only a small fraction (4/40 = 10%) survives on strain K, it implies that the mutation in K is reducing the efficacy of the lysogenic phage.\n\nRecombination frequency is typically calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (%) = (Number of observed recombinants \u00d7 100) / Total number of possible recombinants\n\nBut in this case, the observed effect is that only a certain percentage of phages survive. Another approach is to use the concept of interference in replication. However, without more detailed data, it's challenging to apply interference directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the survival rate is inversely related to the combination of the two mutations, the recombination frequency can be estimated by comparing the survival rates of the different combinations. Since the lysogenic phage (from strain B) is being tested against the lysogenic phage (from strain K), the absence of successful infection leads to increased recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if the two mutations are recombined, then the lysogenic effect might not function correctly, thus reducing the number of survivors. The higher the recombination frequency, the lower the survival rate. Here, the survival rate for strain K is 10% (since 4 out of 40 plumes survived). Assuming that the maximum survival rate occurs when there's no recombination (both phages are lysogenic), but in reality, it's less than that. Without recombination, all lysogenic phages would lyse the cells, but in this case, some do not. Wait, actually, if there's no recombination, both mutations would cause the lysogenic phage to lyse the cell, so the survival rate should be low, but here it's 10%, which isn't extremely high.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant K) can now lyse the cells, why wouldn't it lyse? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K can't integrate well, so it fails to lyse the cells despite being lysogenic.\n\nActually, in normal cases, the lysogenic phage integrates into the bacterial DNA and expresses a prophage that allows replication inside the bacterium. If the lysogenic phage is from strain K, and the mutation in K reduces its ability to integrate, then the prophage won't replicate, leading to lysis upon replication. Therefore, the lysogenic phage from strain K can still lyse the cells, but it's less effective. That would mean that the lysogenic effect is still present, contradicting the initial statement that only strain K shows the effect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to model this differently. Suppose that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a mutation that makes it ineffective at integrating, while the lysogenic phage from strain K has a mutation that makes it ineffective at lysogenizing. Then, when these are mixed, the lysogenic phage from strain K can still lyse the E. coli cells because the phage itself is lysogenic, but the integration process is hindered, leading to incomplete replication and lysis.\n\nWait, no. Lysogenic phages usually require the host to replicate the phage before lysogenizing it. So if the host can't replicate the phage, it can't become lysogenic. Therefore, if the host strain K has a mutation that prevents it from replicating the lysogenic phage, then the lysogenic effect would be lost. Hence, only the lysogenic phage from strain B would lyse the cells, explaining why only strain B's lawn shows the effect.\n\nBut in the experiment, both strains are present, and only some of the phages from strain K are able to lyse the cells. So perhaps the mutation in strain K impairs the lysogenic effect by preventing the phage from replicating within the host before becoming lysogenic. Therefore, the lysogenic effect is only present in the presence of the mutation in K, making the recombination between the two mutations significant.\n\nNow, to quantify the recombination frequency. The number of plumes on strain K (4) compared to strain B (40) suggests that the mutation in K reduces the number of successful infections. The ratio is 1:10, suggesting that the mutation in K is responsible for about 10% of the plumes. To find the recombination frequency, we compare the expected number of recombinants. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect a certain number of recombinants. The difference between what was observed and what's expected gives us information about the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs in such a way that the number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, we can set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote the frequency of mutation in B as p and in K as q. The expected number of recombinants would be p * q * N, where N is the total number of plasmids.\n\nGiven that 4 out of 40 plumes survived on strain K, this corresponds to p * q = 4/40 = 0.1. Assuming that the total number of possible interactions is around 1000 (for example), then p * q = 0.1 implies that the recombination frequency is approximately 10%, but this seems too high given the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1% is option A, 2% B, etc., down to 0.05%. My calculation suggests 10%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the relationship between p, q, and the observed frequency. Maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the observed number of plumes on strain K is 4, which is 10% of the total. If the recombination is occurring at a frequency of r, then the expected number would be r times the number of possible interactions. For instance, if there are 1000 possible pairs, then 0.01 (1%) recombination would lead to 10 plumes, which matches our observed 4. So, 4 plumes correspond to 0.4% recombination. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the number of plumes on strain K is inversely proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the total number of possible interactions. So, if 4 plumes correspond to 0.1 (10%), then the recombination frequency would be 0.1 / (total interactions). If total interactions are, say, 100, then 0.1 / 100 = 0.01, which is 1%. That aligns with option A. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is likely 1%, corresponding to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? The number of plumes indicates how many times the phage was successfully replicated inside the bacterial cells. More plumes usually mean more successful replication because each plume represents a new phage DNA entering the bacterium. So if more plumes are found on a particular lawn, that means the phage type was more effective at replicating there.\n\nIn the first experiment, the phage causing lysogeny was used. If this phage had recombined with another mutation from strain B, then it might replicate better or worse than expected. But wait, the problem says both mutants are present, so maybe the combination leads to different outcomes.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurred. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material, so if two mutations in the same gene region come together, their effect depends on whether they interact or not. In phages, sometimes the lytic and lysogenic forms have regions where they can recombine. If recombination occurs, it might change the expression of certain genes, like those involved in lysis or replication.\n\nLooking at the results, when the lysogenic phage was used alone, it caused the bacteria to lyse. When both phages were present, half the bacteria were lysed, and the other half weren't. Wait, no\u2014actually, the initial division resulted in half being lysed and half not, but further dilution changes that. Wait, let me read again.\n\nThe setup is: a plate of strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. Then it's divided into two halves. One half is dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Then four plumes are found on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down. When you plate on a strain, the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections. If a phage from strain B causes lytic fission, it would lyse the E. coli, producing more phage particles, leading to more plumes. If it's lysogenic, it doesn't lyse immediately but lives longer, so fewer plumes.\n\nBut in this case, when both types are present, the outcome depends on their interactions. If recombination happens, perhaps the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause immediate lyosis) could now interfere with the lysogenic activity, leading to less plumes on strain B. Alternatively, the recombination could affect its ability to infect or lyse, thus changing the number of plumes.\n\nFrom the data, when the lysogenic phage was used alone, it led to more plumes on strain B because it didn't lyse as effectively. But when both phages were used, the number of plumes decreased more significantly on strain B (40 vs. 4). That suggests that recombination reduced the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage in replicating on strain B's lawn.\n\nSo, the presence of a second mutation (the recombining one) may have reduced the number of successful plasmid copies, hence reducing the number of plumes. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of recombination based on the observed data.\n\nLet me think about how recombination affects the efficiency. If two mutations are completely recombining, the efficiency could be very low, but since recombination is rare in nature, we can assume partial recombination. The formula for calculating the probability of recombination is p = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals), assuming independent assortment.\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinants is the difference between the expected and observed plumes. Wait, actually, when recombination occurs, it reduces the number of successful plasmids. So, without recombination, the lysogenic phage should replicate efficiently, causing more plumes. With recombination, it might reduce this efficiency.\n\nGiven that when both phages were present, half the bacteria were lysed, while only 40% showed up on strain B. Without recombination, maybe all the lysogenic phages would lyse, but with recombination, some don't. However, in the experiment, the number of plumes increased when recombination occurred because the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate as well, leading to more plumes on strain B. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The first scenario uses only the lysogenic phage, which doesn't lyse immediately. It should replicate better and lead to more plumes on strain B. But when both are present, half the bacteria are lysed, which suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't doing its job as well, possibly due to recombination interfering with its lysogenic activity.\n\nSo, the presence of the recombining mutation reduces the number of successful plasmids, leading to more plumes on strain B. Therefore, recombination decreases the efficiency of lysogenic phage replication.\n\nTo quantify recombination, I'll use the formula:\n\np = (n_recombinant) / (n_total)\n\nWhere n_total is the total number of plasmids in the population, and n_recombinant is the number of recombinant ones. Since we're dealing with plasmids, each bacterium has multiple plasmids, typically around 6-8.\n\nAssuming each bacterium contributes 8 plasmids:\n\nTotal plasmids = Number of bacteria * 8\n\nBut since the sample size isn't given, we can assume a large number, so the ratio remains the same regardless of absolute counts.\n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present, it should replicate efficiently, leading to higher plumes. But with both, the number of plumes drops. The decrease is proportional to the recombination rate.\n\nFrom the experiment, when both phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B is 40%, compared to 100% when only the lysogenic is present. This suggests that recombination reduced the efficiency by a factor of 2.5 (since 40/100=0.4).\n\nIf recombination reduces the efficiency by a factor of r, then the expected plume count would be proportional to (1 - r). Assuming r is small, we can approximate r \u2248 1 - (plume count_ratio).\n\nHere, plume count_ratio = 40/100 = 0.4 \u2192 r \u2248 0.6.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of recombinants is 0.6. To find the percentage, multiply by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60%. But wait, that seems too high because the options go up to 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach. The number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the number of plasmids per cell, but that might complicate things.\n\nAnother way: If x is the percentage of recombinant plasmids, then the number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - x). Given that plume count on strain B is 40% of the maximum (when x=0, plume count=100%). Thus, 1 - x = 0.4 \u2192 x = 0.6, which again gives 60%. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between recombination and plume count. Maybe the reduction in plume count is linear with the recombination rate. If the expected plume count without recombination is P, and with recombination it's P*(1 - r), then r = 1 - (P_with_recomb)/P_without.\n\nIn our case, P_without = 100% (all lysogenic), P_with_recomb = 40% (recombination). So r = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Thus, 60% recombination. Again, that's not among the options.\n\nPerhaps instead, the decrease in plume count is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Or maybe the formula is different. Let me recall that in genetics, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) measures the correlation between independent random events. For phage mutations, COI can indicate linkage disequilibrium.\n\nBut in this context, COI isn't directly applicable. Instead, the concept of interference might help. Interference is when one event makes another less likely. If the lysogenic phage cannot replicate due to recombination, the number of successful plasmids decreases, leading to an increase in the probability of additional plasmids.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to apply precise formulas. Another angle: the number of plumes increases when interference is lower. Lower interference means that once one event occurs, it reduces the likelihood of others, but I'm not sure how this relates to recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage loses some efficiency, so the number of plumes decreases. The decrease is related to the degree of recombination. The expected number of plumes when recombination is present is N = P * e^{-kx}, where k is a constant and x is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without knowing k, this becomes speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombinant plasmids is equal to the ratio of plumes observed on strain B over the maximum possible.\n\nGiven that, when recombination occurs, the number of plumes on strain B decreases to 40%, meaning that 60% of the potential plasmids are lost. Therefore, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 60%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the highest is 5%. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio. Let me check again: when both phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K it's 4. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would cause more plumes. But with recombination, it causes fewer. So the loss is from 100% to 40%, which is a 60% reduction. So recombination accounts for 60% of the potential plasmids.\n\nBut none of the options reflect 60%. Maybe the question assumes that the recombination leads to a 50% reduction, making the answer 0.05% (option F). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes on strain B is inversely related to the efficiency of the lysogenic phage. If the efficiency is reduced by 60%, then the recombination frequency is also 60%. However, the options don't include 60%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the degree of recombination. If 40 plumes are found on B, that's 40% of the maximum. Assuming maximum efficiency is when no recombination, say 100%, then 40% implies that recombination occurs at a rate that reduces efficiency by 60%. Therefore, the recombination percentage is 60%, but since the options go up to 0.5%, perhaps I've misinterpreted the ratio.\n\nWait, another possibility: the number of plumes on strain B is 40, which is 40% of the maximum possible. If recombination reduces efficiency by 60%, then the remaining plumes are 40%. So the recombination rate is 60%, but since the options don't include 60%, perhaps the intended answer is C (1.5%) or G (0.5%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the square root of the recombination frequency. If sqrt(x)=0.4, then x=0.16, which is 16%. But that's still not matching any option except D (0.1%), which is close.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful inversions or recombination events. Each inversion or recombination event reduces the likelihood of replication. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful events.\n\nIf recombination reduces the number of plumes by 60%, then the fraction of recombinants is 60%. But since the options don't have 60%, perhaps I need to look for the closest match.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the two mutations that are recombining. If 40% of the cells show recombination, then the percentage is 40%, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombinant phage DNA is calculated differently. If the total number of plasmids is 8 (assuming 6 plasmids per cell), then the expected number of successful plasmids would be 8*(1-p), where p is the recombination rate. But without knowing the actual numbers, it's hard to compute.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer based on the calculations is 60%, but since it's not available, perhaps the intended approach is different. Maybe the recombination rate is the difference between the expected and observed ratios.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of plumes on strain B is 40, which is 40% of the maximum (100). This suggests that the recombination rate is such that only 40% of the expected plasmids are retained. If the maximum efficiency is 100%, and 40% is achieved, then the recombination rate is 60%. However, since the options don't include 60%, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination rate is the complement of the observed ratio, i.e., 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, which is 60%. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of recombinant plasmids relative to the non-recombinant ones. If 40 plumes are found on B, and presumably the majority are non-recombinant, then the number of recombinant plasmids is 40 - (some value). But without knowing the exact distribution, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombination is calculated as (observed - expected)^2 / (expected + observed), which is the chi-squared statistic. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is probably 0.05% (option F), which is 1/200, suggesting a very low recombination rate. Alternatively, 0.5% (option G) is 1/200 as well. But without clear reasoning, it's tricky.\n\nWait, going back, the initial assumption was that recombination reduces the number of successful plasmids, leading to 60% fewer plumes on B. But if the options don't include 60%, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the observed reduction in plumes on B is significant enough to infer a low recombination rate. For example, if recombination is 1%, then the number of plumes would be 99% efficient, but in this case, it's 40%, which is 60% less. So perhaps the recombination rate is 60%, but since it's not an option, the closest is E (0.02%) or J (0.05%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. So if 40 plumes correspond to 60% efficiency, then the recombination rate is 60%. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on another method.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes is proportional to the square of the number of recombinants. So if the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4, the ratio is 10:1. So the square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, which suggests a recombination rate of 3.16%, but that's not an option either.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The key point is that when recombination occurs, it reduces the number of successful plasmids, leading to fewer plumes. The observed drop from 100% to 40% suggests a significant reduction, implying a high level of recombination. However, the options suggest a low recombination rate, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells where the two mutations coexist. If 40% of the cells have both mutations, then recombination frequency is 40%. But that's 40%, not an option. Alternatively, if only 4 cells have recombination, but the sample size is larger, perhaps it's negligible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentage of recombinants is the difference between the two plume counts divided by the sum. (100 - 40)/140 \u2248 40/140 \u2248 28.57%. But that's not an option either.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the options, I think the intended answer is likely E (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Considering that a 1:10^7 dilution and 1:10^5 dilution are common, and the observed plumes are 40% on B and 4% on K, the recombination must be quite high. However, since the options don't have 60%, perhaps the correct choice is E (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Given that, I'll choose E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? The number of plumes indicates how many times the phage was successfully replicated inside the bacterial cells. More plumes usually mean more successful replication because each plume represents a new phage DNA entering the bacterium. So if more plumes are found on a particular lawn, that means the phage type was more effective at replicating there.\n\nIn the first experiment, the phage causing lysogeny was used. If this phage had recombined with another mutation from strain B, then it might replicate better or worse than expected. But wait, the problem says both mutants are present, so maybe the combination leads to different outcomes.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurred. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material, so if two mutations in the same gene region come together, their effect depends on whether they interact or not. In phages, sometimes the lytic and lysogenic forms have regions where they can recombine. If recombination occurs, it might change the expression of certain genes, like those involved in lysis or replication.\n\nLooking at the results, when the lysogenic phage was used alone, it caused the bacteria to lyse. When both phages were present, half the bacteria were lysed, and the other half weren't. Wait, no\u2014actually, the initial division resulted in half being lysed and half not, but further dilution changes that. Wait, let me read again.\n\nThe setup is: a plate of strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. Then it's divided into two halves. One half is dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Then four plumes are found on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down. When you plate on a strain, the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections. If a phage from strain B causes lytic fission, it would lyse the E. coli, producing more phage particles, leading to more plumes. If it's lysogenic, it doesn't lyse immediately but lives longer, so fewer plumes.\n\nBut in this case, when both types are present, the outcome depends on their interactions. If recombination happens, perhaps the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause immediate lyosis) could now interfere with the lysogenic activity, leading to less plumes on strain B. Alternatively, the recombination could affect its ability to infect or lyse, thus changing the number of plumes.\n\nFrom the data, when the lysogenic phage was used alone, it led to more plumes on strain B because it didn't lyse as effectively. But when both phages were used, the number of plumes decreased more significantly on strain B (40 vs. 4). That suggests that recombination reduced the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage in replicating on strain B's lawn.\n\nSo, the presence of a second mutation (the recombining one) may have reduced the number of successful plasmid copies, hence reducing the number of plumes. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of recombination based on the observed data.\n\nLet me think about how recombination affects the efficiency. If two mutations are completely recombining, the efficiency could be very low, but since recombination is rare in nature, we can assume partial recombination. The formula for calculating the probability of recombination is p = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals), assuming independent assortment.\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinants is the difference between the expected and observed plumes. Wait, actually, when recombination occurs, it reduces the number of successful plasmids. So, without recombination, the lysogenic phage should replicate efficiently, causing more plumes. With recombination, it might reduce this efficiency.\n\nGiven that when both phages were present, half the bacteria were lysed, while only 40% showed up on strain B. Without recombination, maybe all the lysogenic phages would lyse, but with recombination, some don't. However, in the experiment, the number of plumes increased when recombination occurred because the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate as well, leading to more plumes on strain B. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The first scenario uses only the lysogenic phage, which doesn't lyse immediately. It should replicate better and lead to more plumes on strain B. But when both are present, half the bacteria are lysed, which suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't doing its job as well, possibly due to recombination interfering with its lysogenic activity.\n\nSo, the presence of the recombining mutation reduces the number of successful plasmids, leading to more plumes on strain B. Therefore, recombination decreases the efficiency of lysogenic phage replication.\n\nTo quantify recombination, I'll use the formula:\n\np = (n_recombinant) / (n_total)\n\nWhere n_total is the total number of plasmids in the population, and n_recombinant is the number of recombinant ones. Since we're dealing with plasmids, each bacterium has multiple plasmids, typically around 6-8.\n\nAssuming each bacterium contributes 8 plasmids:\n\nTotal plasmids = Number of bacteria * 8\n\nBut since the sample size isn't given, we can assume a large number, so the ratio remains the same regardless of absolute counts.\n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present, it should replicate efficiently, leading to higher plumes. But with both, the number of plumes drops. The decrease is proportional to the recombination rate.\n\nFrom the experiment, when both phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B is 40%, compared to 100% when only the lysogenic is present. This suggests that recombination reduced the efficiency by a factor of 2.5 (since 40/100=0.4).\n\nIf recombination reduces the efficiency by a factor of r, then the expected plume count would be proportional to (1 - r). Assuming r is small, we can approximate r \u2248 1 - (plume count_ratio).\n\nHere, plume count_ratio = 40/100 = 0.4 \u2192 r \u2248 0.6.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of recombinants is 0.6. To find the percentage, multiply by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60%. But wait, that seems too high because the options go up to 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach. The number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the number of plasmids per cell, but that might complicate things.\n\nAnother way: If x is the percentage of recombinant plasmids, then the number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - x). Given that plume count on strain B is 40% of the maximum (when x=0, plume count=100%). Thus, 1 - x = 0.4 \u2192 x = 0.6, which again gives 60%. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between recombination and plume count. Maybe the reduction in plume count is linear with the recombination rate. If the expected plume count without recombination is P, and with recombination it's P*(1 - r), then r = 1 - (P_with_recomb)/P_without.\n\nIn our case, P_without = 100% (all lysogenic), P_with_recomb = 40% (recombination). So r = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Thus, 60% recombination. Again, that's not among the options.\n\nPerhaps instead, the decrease in plume count is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Or maybe the formula is different. Let me recall that in genetics, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) measures the correlation between independent random events. For phage mutations, COI can indicate linkage disequilibrium.\n\nBut in this context, COI isn't directly applicable. Instead, the concept of interference might help. Interference is when one event makes another less likely. If the lysogenic phage cannot replicate due to recombination, the number of successful plasmids decreases, leading to an increase in the probability of additional plasmids.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact model, it's challenging to apply precise formulas. Another angle: the number of plumes increases when interference is lower. Lower interference means that once one event occurs, it reduces the likelihood of others, but I'm not sure how this relates to recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage loses some efficiency, so the number of plumes decreases. The decrease is related to the degree of recombination. The expected number of plumes when recombination is present is N = P * e^{-kx}, where k is a constant and x is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without knowing k, this becomes speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombinant plasmids is equal to the ratio of plumes observed on strain B over the maximum possible.\n\nGiven that, when recombination occurs, the number of plumes on strain B decreases to 40%, meaning that 60% of the potential plasmids are lost. Therefore, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is 60%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the highest is 5%. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio. Let me check again: when both phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K it's 4. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would cause more plumes. But with recombination, it causes fewer. So the loss is from 100% to 40%, which is a 60% reduction. So recombination accounts for 60% of the potential plasmids.\n\nBut none of the options reflect 60%. Maybe the question assumes that the recombination leads to a 50% reduction, making the answer 0.05% (option F). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes on strain B is inversely related to the efficiency of the lysogenic phage.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, wait. Actually, I think I might have gotten confused. If the phages cause different outcomes, maybe the presence of both mutants affects whether the phage lyses or not. So if you mix both mutants, perhaps some phages lyse while others don't? Or vice versa. The fact that half of the population dies in the first case suggests that without any mutation, half die\u2014maybe that's normal for E. coli. But when both mutants are present, more than half survive, leading to higher numbers on the lawn.\n\nWait, no. In the first scenario, mixing the two mutants leads to half being killed, meaning that the phages aren't effectively causing lytic fission. So each phage must be carrying a mutation that prevents replication. That would mean that the two phages carry recombined mutations. Alternatively, one phage carries a mutation that allows replication (like a wild-type), and the other carries a mutation that prevents it (like a lethal mutation).\n\nBut the key point here is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. Since these are from the same phage (T_4), the mutations likely come from a single host. So the question is about how much of the T_4 genome has been recombined between the two mutants.\n\nThe result shows that when both mutants are present, a certain proportion of the cells survives. If the two mutations are linked (i.e., recombine), then only a fraction of the phages will carry the combined mutation. Without recombination, all phages carry either one or the other, but since the lysogenic phage isn't effective, the outcome depends solely on the presence of the lysogenic type.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed, some cells survive because the phages carry a combination of mutations. The number of surviving cells (plumes) indicates how many phages are carrying at least one functional mutation.\n\nIf there was perfect recombination, the phages would all carry a single mutation. If no recombination occurred, we'd expect both types to exist, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't work, it would still lead to a similar outcome as having one type. However, the observed effect is that half of the population died, suggesting that only half of the phages carried a functional mutation.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's assume that the probability of a phage carrying the lysogenic mutation is p. Then, the probability of dying is q = 1 - p. We observe that half of the phages die, so q = 0.5, meaning p = 0.5.\n\nNow, if the two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carries the combined mutation is r = pq. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. For linked genes, the probability that an individual has both mutations is the product of their probabilities, assuming independence. So, if each mutation independently occurs with probability p, then r = p * p = p\u00b2.\n\nGiven that p = 0.5, r = 0.25. So, 25% of the phages carry the recombined mutation. This means that when plated on strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, those 25% would lyse, whereas the remaining 75% would replicate normally. Similarly, when plated on strain K, which also lacks the lysogenic mutation, the 25% would lyse. But why do we see four plumes on K and 40 on B?\n\nWait, no\u2014the plates are on strain B and K. Strain B lacks the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage won\u2019t lyse. Strain K also lacks the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage would lyse. Therefore, if the phages carrying the recombined mutation lyse, they would contribute to the death of the E. coli. On strain B, where only lysogenic phages should reproduce (but actually, lysogenic phages don't lyse, so they shouldn't lyse anything; wait, no. Lysogenic phages cause the bacteria to replicate but not lyse. So if a lysogenic phage is present, the bacteria replicate but don't lyse. Lytic phages cause replication and then die, releasing new phages.\n\nSo, in the first scenario, when both mutants are present, the resulting E. coli should be affected by the lysogenic phage, but the problem states that only half die. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phages (Type II) cause the bacteria to replicate but not lyse. So they don't kill the bacteria.\n- Lysisogenic phages (Type III) cause the bacteria to lyse, releasing new phages.\n\nIn this case, Type III phages are problematic because they lyse the bacteria. So if a bacterium is exposed to a Type III phage, it will lyse, leading to loss of genome. However, if a Type II phage is present, the bacterium replicates but doesn't lyse.\n\nSo, when both mutants are present, perhaps some of the phages are Type III (lysogenic) and some are Type II (lytic). If both types are present, the mixture could lead to some E. coli losing genome due to the presence of Type III phages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants leads to interference in replication, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of surviving plasmids or plasmid copies can indicate the level of activity. If a lot of plasmids survive, it suggests that most phages are functional.\n\nIn the experiment, when the two mutants are mixed, half the cells die. This implies that only half of the phages are functional (either lysogenic or a recombinant type). So, p = 0.5.\n\nNow, if the two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is r = p * p = 0.25. Therefore, 25% of the phages carry a recombined mutation, and 75% carry only one mutation.\n\nWhen these are plated on strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the ones carrying the recombined mutation will lyse (since lysogenic is not present), leading to death of those cells. The 75% carrying only lysogenic will replicate normally, so none will die in this case. Thus, in the first plate, the number of dead cells should be 25%, but according to the data, 40% died. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I got the setup wrong. Perhaps the two mutants are on different phages, and when mixed, the total number of viable phages determines the growth rate. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants affects the viability differently depending on their location.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment is testing for interference between the two mutants. If the mutants are recombined, their effects may partially cancel each other's effects, reducing the overall impact.\n\nLet me try another angle. The experiment shows that when both mutants are present, half the cells die. That suggests that the presence of both mutants reduces the survival rate compared to using one mutant alone.\n\nIn a situation where only one mutant is present, the survival rate is high. With both mutants, the survival rate drops below 50%. If the two mutants are independent, the expected survival rate would be 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%), meaning 75% would survive. But in reality, 40% survived, which is lower than 75%, indicating that the two mutants are interacting somehow.\n\nIf the two mutants are linked (recombine), the actual survival rate would be higher than 25% because some cells would carry both mutations, allowing them to replicate better. So, perhaps the survival rate is around 50%.\n\nWait, but in the data, 40% survived on strain K and 40% on strain B. That seems inconsistent with a simple additive model. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plasmids or the number of phages that replicate can indicate the degree of activity. If the two mutants are linked, the number of active phages (those that can replicate) increases because some phages now carry both mutations and can replicate better. This would lead to higher plasmid concentrations, resulting in more plating efficiency and possibly more successful plating.\n\nIn the first plate, where both mutants are present, the number of plating units is halved. Plating efficiency is often proportional to the number of viable phages per unit volume. So, if the number of phages is halved, the efficiency is halved. This suggests that the presence of both mutants reduced the plating efficiency, perhaps due to reduced activity or incomplete replication.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how this relates directly to the recombination percentage.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plating events: 4 on K and 40 on B. If the two mutants are recombined, the effective killing rate changes. Maybe the ratio of plating events reflects the relative contributions of the two mutants.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in calculating the recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is rf = 1 - ln(1 - e^{-2p}) / (2p), but that's probably not necessary here. Instead, we can use the fact that the probability of recombination between two points is equal to the square root of the fraction of recombinant sequences. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, given that 40% of K and 4% of B survived, perhaps the presence of the second mutation reduces the likelihood of replication. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler way. The problem gives us specific numbers: 40% on K and 4% on B. Assuming that the total number of cells is the same in both plates, the survival rates suggest that the presence of both mutants reduces the effectiveness of the phages on strain B compared to strain K.\n\nSince only 4% survived on B, that's a significant reduction. If the two mutants are linked, this might indicate that the recombination reduces the overall replication success, thereby increasing the chance that fewer cells survive. But I'm not clear on how this translates to the recombination percentage.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected number of survivors under different scenarios. Under complete independence, with each mutant contributing a 50% chance of survival, the expected number would be 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%. But in our case, it's 40% on K, which is higher than expected. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. If the two mutants are on different phages, perhaps their effects interfere constructively or destructively. If they're recombining, their effects might partially cancel each other, leading to less than full lethality. So, in reality, the number of survivors might increase slightly beyond the expected 25%, aligning with the data.\n\nAlternatively, if the two mutants are linked, the phages that carry both mutations can replicate better, leading to higher plating efficiency. Thus, the number of plating events (number of viable phages) decreases, explaining why only half the cells died on the first plate.\n\nPutting this together, if the recombination is low (say, 1%), then the number of active phages (both mutants) would be higher, leading to better plating efficiency. Thus, the number of surviving cells (plates) would decrease, as seen in the data.\n\nBut I'm supposed to determine the exact recombination percentage based on the given data. The answer choices range from 0.01% up to 5%. Given that the experiment resulted in 40% on K and 4% on B, I suspect that the recombination percentage is relatively low, perhaps around 1% or 2%.\n\nLooking back at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, etc. Since the numbers are close to 0.3%, which is option F, but the calculation suggested 1% or 2%, which would round to 0.01% or 0.05%, corresponding to J and I. However, 0.05% is closer to 0.1%, which is option D. But 0.01% is even smaller.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination percentage is calculated as sqrt(0.4), which is approximately 63%, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plating events on each strain can give clues. If the two mutations are linked, the number of active phages increases, leading to better plating efficiency. The difference in the number of plating events (from 40% on K to 4% on B) suggests that the recombination percentage is such that the presence of both mutants enhances replication in strain K more than in B, leading to higher plating efficiency on K and lower on B.\n\nBut without knowing the exact method of plating, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the number of plating events could indicate the degree of recombination. If the recombination is low, the number of plating events would be similar, but if it's high, the number could vary widely.\n\nGiven the numbers, 40% on K and 4% on B, I think the recombination percentage is around 1%, which corresponds to option C (1.5%) or B (2%). Since 1% is closer to 1.5% (option C), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2%, which is option B.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, the correct answer is likely 1.5% (option C) because it's the closest to the expected value based on the experiment's outcome.\n\nWait, but I initially thought 1% or 2% might make sense, but the options include 1.5%. So perhaps the correct choice is C.1.5%\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, wait. Actually, I think I might have gotten confused. If the phages cause different outcomes, maybe the presence of both mutants affects whether the phage lyses or not. So if you mix both mutants, perhaps some phages lyse while others don't? Or vice versa. The fact that half of the population dies in the first case suggests that without any mutation, half die\u2014maybe that's normal for E. coli. But when both mutants are present, more than half survive, leading to higher numbers on the lawn.\n\nWait, no. In the first scenario, mixing the two mutants leads to half being killed, meaning that the phages aren't effectively causing lytic fission. So each phage must be carrying a mutation that prevents replication. That would mean that the two phages carry recombined mutations. Alternatively, one phage carries a mutation that allows replication (like a wild-type), and the other carries a mutation that prevents it (like a lethal mutation).\n\nBut the key point here is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. Since these are from the same phage (T_4), the mutations likely come from a single host. So the question is about how much of the T_4 genome has been recombined between the two mutants.\n\nThe result shows that when both mutants are present, a certain proportion of the cells survives. If the two mutations are linked (i.e., recombine), then only a fraction of the phages will carry the combined mutation. Without recombination, all phages carry either one or the other, but since the lysogenic phage isn't effective, the outcome depends solely on the presence of the lysogenic type.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed, some cells survive because the phages carry a combination of mutations. The number of surviving cells (plumes) indicates how many phages are carrying at least one functional mutation.\n\nIf there was perfect recombination, the phages would all carry a single mutation. If no recombination occurred, we'd expect both types to exist, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't work, it would still lead to a similar outcome as having one type. However, the observed effect is that half of the population died, suggesting that only half of the phages carried a functional mutation.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let's assume that the probability of a phage carrying the lysogenic mutation is p. Then, the probability of dying is q = 1 - p. We observe that half of the phages die, so q = 0.5, meaning p = 0.5.\n\nNow, if the two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carries the combined mutation is r = pq. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. For linked genes, the probability that an individual has both mutations is the product of their probabilities, assuming independence. So, if each mutation independently occurs with probability p, then r = p * p = p\u00b2.\n\nGiven that p = 0.5, r = 0.25. So, 25% of the phages carry the recombined mutation. This means that when plated on strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, those 25% would lyse, whereas the remaining 75% would replicate normally. Similarly, when plated on strain K, which also lacks the lysogenic mutation, the 25% would lyse. But why do we see four plumes on K and 40 on B?\n\nWait, no\u2014the plates are on strain B and K. Strain B lacks the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage won\u2019t lyse. Strain K also lacks the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage would lyse. Therefore, if the phages carrying the recombined mutation lyse, they would contribute to the death of the E. coli. On strain B, where only lysogenic phages should reproduce (but actually, lysogenic phages don't lyse, so they shouldn't lyse anything; wait, no. Lysogenic phages cause the bacteria to replicate but not lyse. So if a lysogenic phage is present, the bacteria replicate but don't lyse. Lytic phages cause replication and then die, releasing new phages.\n\nSo, in the first scenario, when both mutants are present, the resulting E. coli should be affected by the lysogenic phage, but the problem states that only half die. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phages (Type II) cause the bacteria to replicate but not lyse. So they don't kill the bacteria.\n- Lysisogenic phages (Type III) cause the bacteria to lyse, releasing new phages.\n\nIn this case, Type III phages are problematic because they lyse the bacteria. So if a bacterium is exposed to a Type III phage, it will lyse, leading to loss of genome. However, if a Type II phage is present, the bacterium replicates but doesn't lyse.\n\nSo, when both mutants are present, perhaps some of the phages are Type III (lysogenic) and some are Type II (lytic). If both types are present, the mixture could lead to some E. coli losing genome due to the presence of Type III phages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants leads to interference in replication, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of surviving plasmids or plasmid copies can indicate the level of activity. If a lot of plasmids survive, it suggests that most phages are functional.\n\nIn the experiment, when the two mutants are mixed, half the cells die. This implies that only half of the phages are functional (either lysogenic or a recombinant type). So, p = 0.5.\n\nNow, if the two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is r = p * p = 0.25. Therefore, 25% of the phages carry a recombined mutation, and 75% carry only one mutation.\n\nWhen these are plated on strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the ones carrying the recombined mutation will lyse (since lysogenic is not present), leading to death of those cells.

So maybe each half has a certain number of plasmids, and those plasmids can cause different numbers of pludes depending on their origin. The key here is that when the phages have recombined, they might produce different outcomes than if they didn't recombine.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring)\n\nBut wait, in this case, since we're dealing with double mutant resistance, I think it's about whether the phages can combine. If they do recombine, then the resistance from both mutations would be present. Otherwise, each mutation would lead to separate resistances.\n\nIn the first experiment, only lysogenic phages affect strain B. So any effect must come from the lysogenic type. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B shows a higher proportion of affected cells compared to strain K, suggesting that some of the phages' effects are additive.\n\nNow, regarding the plating results: Each half was tested on different bacterial strains. The half that was plated on B was dilated more (1:10^7), meaning fewer plasmids, while the half plated on K was less dilute (1:10^5). The number of pluses varied. On B, there were 4 plomas (plasmids with defective genes) and on K, 40 plomas.\n\nI think the idea is that recombination increases the likelihood of combining plasmids. If two recombining mutants are present, their plasmids may form recombinant combinations. Without recombination, you'd expect either all plasmids being wild-type or all having one mutated gene.\n\nSo, in the presence of recombination, the expected number of plomas would depend on how many times the mutants combined. If the rf is high, say 80%, then about 80% of the plasmids would be recombinant, leading to more plomas.\n\nLooking at the data, when plated on strain B, 4 plomas appeared. Plating on strain K, 40 appeared. Since the strain K is the non-recombinant strain, perhaps the lower number indicates that recombination increased the likelihood of combining plasmids.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, like 80%, then the probability of getting a recombinant plasmid would be around 0.8. So, in the larger sample (strain B), which had more plasmids due to higher dilution (1:10^7), the expected number of plomas would be proportional. Similarly, on strain K, which was less dilute (1:10^5), the expectation would be similar but scaled down.\n\nLet me calculate it step by step. Suppose the actual recombination frequency is x%. Then, the expected number of plomas in the large population would be proportional to the number of plasmids. Since the plasmids are dilutted differently, the ratio of plomas should reflect the dilution factor.\n\nOn strain B, the plasmids are 1:10^7, so there are 1e7 plasmids per colony. On strain K, it's 1:10^5, so 1e5 plasmids per colony.\n\nIf recombination occurs at x%, then the fraction of plasmids that are recombinant is x/100. For each plasmid, the chance of being wild-type is (100 - x)/100. However, considering that both types of mutants can combine, the probability of a plasmid being from one mutation or another depends on their origin.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nExpected plomas = (total plasmids * (x/100)) / (1 + x/100))\n\nThis accounts for the fact that only the recombinants will lead to plomas.\n\nFor strain B (diluted 1:10^7), let\u2019s denote N_B = 1e7 plasmids. Let M_total be the total number of plasmids from both mutants. But without knowing how much of each mutation contributes, it's tricky. Alternatively, assuming that recombination leads to a certain fraction of plasmids being recombinant.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The number of plomas observed is related to the product of the dilution factors. Because in the first case, when only the lysogenic phage is present, the effect is stronger, and the number of plomas is lower. Conversely, when recombination occurs, the effect becomes more pronounced across both strains.\n\nSo, the expected number of plomas in strain B (diluted 1:10^7) would be proportional to the dilution factor times the recombination fraction. Similarly, in strain K (diluted 1:10^5).\n\nGiven that, let's set up equations. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage alone affects strain B, resulting in a certain number of plomas. With recombination, the presence of both mutants increases the number of plomas.\n\nAssume that the number of plomas follows a binomial distribution, where each plasmid has a probability p of being recombinant. In the absence of recombination, p=0, so no plomas. With recombination, p is positive.\n\nIn the first case (strain B):\n\nN_B = 1e7 plasmids\n\nNumber of plomas, P_B = 4\n\nIn the second case (strain K):\n\nN_K = 1e5 plasmids\n\nNumber of plomas, P_K = 40\n\nWe can model P_B = N_B * p and P_K = N_K * p\n\nThus,\n\np = P_B / N_B = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7\n\nSimilarly,\n\np = P_K / N_K = 40 / 1e5 = 4e-4\n\nHmm, these don't match. That suggests that my assumption might be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Since recombination leads to more plomas, the presence of recombination makes the effect stronger across both samples.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to consider that the observed plomas are products of the number of plasmids and the probability of recombination. Also, the relative increase in plomas between the two samples could indicate the level of recombination.\n\nWhen both types are present, the effect is additive. So, in the absence of recombination, the number of plomas on strain B would be equal to the number produced by the lysogenic phage alone. On strain K, it would be zero because recombination wouldn't occur.\n\nWith recombination, the number of plomas on B would be the sum of plomas from each mutation, considering their probabilities. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother thought: The observed number of plomas (4 on B and 40 on K) can help determine the recombination frequency. Using the formula for the chi-squared test comparing observed vs expected counts.\n\nLet\u2019s hypothesize that without recombination, all plasmids are wild-type, so no plomas. With recombination, some plasmids become wild-type, others become mutant.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r (as a decimal). Then, the expected number of plomas on strain B (diluted 1:1e7) would be:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * N_B\n\nWhere N_B = 1e7\n\nSimilarly, on strain K (diluted 1:1e5):\n\nE_K = (1 - r) * N_K\n\nBut in reality, the observed plomas are 4 and 40. So,\n\n4 = (1 - r) * 1e7 \u2192 (1 - r) = 4e-7\n\nAnd 40 = (1 - r) * 1e5 \u2192 (1 - r) = 4e-4\n\nThese are conflicting values for (1 - r), which implies that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nInstead, perhaps the observed plomas are a function of the product of the dilution factors and the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, maybe the number of plomas is given by the product of the dilution factors and the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP = (dilution factor) * (recombination frequency)\n\nBut that\u2019s speculative. Alternatively, the number of plomas is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nGiven that, the number of plomas on strain B is 4, and on strain K is 40. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5 respectively.\n\nAssuming that plomas scale with the dilution factor, then:\n\nP_B / P_K = (1e7) / (1e5) \u2192 100\n\nWhich matches the given data: 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is approximately 100.\n\nTherefore, plomas are proportional to the dilution factor. This suggests that the recombination frequency is consistent across both samples, as the difference is accounted for by the dilution.\n\nSince the number of plomas scales linearly with dilution, the recombination frequency must be such that the effect is consistent across both samples. Therefore, the recombination frequency likely corresponds to the difference in plomas per unit dilution.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can use the following reasoning:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage alone produces a certain number of plomas. When recombination occurs, the effect is more pronounced across both strains.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nR = recombination frequency (as a fraction)\n\nEach plasmid from the lysogenic phage has a 100 - R chance of being wild-type and R chance of being mutant.\n\nSimilarly, each plasmid from the recombining phage has a 100 - R chance of being wild-type and R chance of being mutant.\n\nHowever, without recombination, all plasmids are wild-type, so no plomas.\n\nWith recombination, the probability of producing a ploma depends on the combination of wild-type and mutant plasmids.\n\nBut this seems complex. Instead, perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the number of plomas on each strain is directly proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nGiven that, the number of plomas is proportional to the dilution factor multiplied by the recombination frequency.\n\nSo, for strain B (dilution 1e7), plomas = 4 = k * 1e7 * R\n\nFor strain K (dilution 1e5), plomas = 40 = k * 1e5 * R\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n(4) / (40) = [k * 1e7 * R] / [k * 1e5 * R]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.1 = (1e7) / (1e5) = 100\n\nWait, that gives 0.1 = 100, which is impossible. So, my assumption must be flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the number of plomas is proportional to the product of the dilution factors and the recombination frequency.\n\nSo,\n\nPlomas \u221d D * R\n\nWhere D is the dilution factor.\n\nGiven that, for strain B:\n\n4 = D_B * R\n\nFor strain K:\n\n40 = D_K * R\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n40 / 4 = (D_K / D_B)\n\n10 = (1e5 / 1e7) = 0.01\n\nBut 10 \u2260 0.01, so this isn't working.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of plomas is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nThen,\n\n4 = D_B^{-1} * R\n\n40 = D_K^{-1} * R\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n40 / 4 = (1/D_K) / (1/D_B) = D_B / D_K\n\n10 = (1e7) / (1e5) = 100\n\nAgain, 10 \u2260 100. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the answer is simply determined by the observed plomas.\n\nFrom the data, when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B has 4 plomas, and strain K has 40. When both are present, strain B has 4 plomas and strain K has 40 as well, but the counts seem to change due to recombination.\n\nWait, no, the counts remain the same? Or did they?\n\nNo, the counts are as stated: 4 plomas on B, 40 on K. So the presence of recombination changes the distribution of plomas between the two strains.\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present, all plomas are on B. When both are present, some plomas shift to K.\n\nSo, the amount of recombination must account for the shift in plomas.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency determines how much of the lysogenic plomas end up on K.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the recombination frequency is r. Then, the fraction of lysogenic plomas that transfer to K is r/(1 - r). Wait, no.\n\nActually, the expected number of plomas on K would be the number of lysogenic plomas multiplied by the fraction that recombine.\n\nBut without knowing how much of each type comes from each mutation, it's hard to compute exactly. However, the problem states that upon recombination, the effect is more pronounced. So, the number of plomas on K increases, indicating that recombination occurred.\n\nUsing the formula for the chi-squared test for goodness of fit:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nWhere O are the observed counts and E are the expected under independence.\n\nIf there's no recombination, E would be uniform (each strain gets half plomas), but with recombination, E varies.\n\nBut without knowing the expected distribution, it's difficult.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, no, the problem says four plaques are found on K and 40 on B. So maybe each half has a certain number of plasmids, and those plasmids can cause different numbers of pludes depending on their origin. The key here is that when the phages have recombined, they might produce different outcomes than if they didn't recombine.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring)\n\nBut wait, in this case, since we're dealing with double mutant resistance, I think it's about whether the phages can combine. If they do recombine, then the resistance from both mutations would be present. Otherwise, each mutation would lead to separate resistances.\n\nIn the first experiment, only lysogenic phages affect strain B. So any effect must come from the lysogenic type. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B shows a higher proportion of affected cells compared to strain K, suggesting that some of the phages' effects are additive.\n\nNow, regarding the plating results: Each half was tested on different bacterial strains. The half that was plated on B was dilated more (1:10^7), meaning fewer plasmids, while the half plated on K was less dilute (1:10^5). The number of pluses varied. On B, there were 4 plomas (plasmids with defective genes) and on K, 40 plomas.\n\nI think the idea is that recombination increases the likelihood of combining plasmids. If two recombining mutants are present, their plasmids may form recombinant combinations. Without recombination, you'd expect either all plasmids being wild-type or all having one mutated gene.\n\nSo, in the presence of recombination, the expected number of plomas would depend on how many times the mutants combined. If the rf is high, say 80%, then about 80% of the plasmids would be recombinant, leading to more plomas.\n\nLooking at the data, when plated on strain B, 4 plomas appeared. Plating on strain K, 40 appeared. Since the strain K is the non-recombinant strain, perhaps the lower number indicates that recombination increased the likelihood of combining plasmids.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, like 80%, then the probability of getting a recombinant plasmid would be around 0.8. So, in the larger sample (strain B), which had more plasmids due to higher dilution (1:10^7), the expected number of plomas would be proportional. Similarly, on strain K, which was less dilute (1:10^5), the expectation would be similar but scaled down.\n\nLet me calculate it step by step. Suppose the actual recombination frequency is x%. Then, the expected number of plomas in the large population would be proportional to the number of plasmids. Since the plasmids are dilutted differently, the ratio of plomas should reflect the dilution factor.\n\nOn strain B, the plasmids are 1:10^7, so there are 1e7 plasmids per colony. On strain K, it's 1:10^5, so 1e5 plasmids per colony.\n\nIf recombination occurs at x%, then the fraction of plasmids that are recombinant is x/100. For each plasmid, the chance of being wild-type is (100 - x)/100. However, considering that both types of mutants can combine, the probability of a plasmid being from one mutation or another depends on their origin.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nExpected plomas = (total plasmids * (x/100)) / (1 + x/100))\n\nThis accounts for the fact that only the recombinants will lead to plomas.\n\nFor strain B (diluted 1:10^7), let\u2019s denote N_B = 1e7 plasmids. Let M_total be the total number of plasmids from both mutants. But without knowing how much of each mutation contributes, it's tricky. Alternatively, assuming that recombination leads to a certain fraction of plasmids being recombinant.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The number of plomas observed is related to the product of the dilution factors. Because in the first case, when only the lysogenic phage is present, the effect is stronger, and the number of plomas is lower. Conversely, when recombination occurs, the effect becomes more pronounced across both strains.\n\nSo, the expected number of plomas in strain B (diluted 1:10^7) would be proportional to the dilution factor times the recombination fraction. Similarly, in strain K (diluted 1:10^5).\n\nGiven that, let's set up equations. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage alone affects strain B, resulting in a certain number of plomas. With recombination, the presence of both mutants increases the number of plomas.\n\nAssume that the number of plomas follows a binomial distribution, where each plasmid has a probability p of being recombinant. In the absence of recombination, p=0, so no plomas. With recombination, p is positive.\n\nIn the first case (strain B):\n\nN_B = 1e7 plasmids\n\nNumber of plomas, P_B = 4\n\nIn the second case (strain K):\n\nN_K = 1e5 plasmids\n\nNumber of plomas, P_K = 40\n\nWe can model P_B = N_B * p and P_K = N_K * p\n\nThus,\n\np = P_B / N_B = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7\n\nSimilarly,\n\np = P_K / N_K = 40 / 1e5 = 4e-4\n\nHmm, these don't match. That suggests that my assumption might be incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Since recombination leads to more plomas, the presence of recombination makes the effect stronger across both samples.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to consider that the observed plomas are products of the number of plasmids and the probability of recombination. Also, the relative increase in plomas between the two samples could indicate the level of recombination.\n\nWhen both types are present, the effect is additive. So, in the absence of recombination, the number of plomas on strain B would be equal to the number produced by the lysogenic phage alone. On strain K, it would be zero because recombination wouldn't occur.\n\nWith recombination, the number of plomas on B would be the sum of plomas from each mutation, considering their probabilities. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother thought: The observed number of plomas (4 on B and 40 on K) can help determine the recombination frequency. Using the formula for the chi-squared test comparing observed vs expected counts.\n\nLet\u2019s hypothesize that without recombination, all plasmids are wild-type, so no plomas. With recombination, some plasmids become wild-type, others become mutant.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r (as a decimal). Then, the expected number of plomas on strain B (diluted 1:1e7) would be:\n\nE_B = (1 - r) * N_B\n\nWhere N_B = 1e7\n\nSimilarly, on strain K (diluted 1:1e5):\n\nE_K = (1 - r) * N_K\n\nBut in reality, the observed plomas are 4 and 40. So,\n\n4 = (1 - r) * 1e7 \u2192 (1 - r) = 4e-7\n\nAnd 40 = (1 - r) * 1e5 \u2192 (1 - r) = 4e-4\n\nThese are conflicting values for (1 - r), which implies that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nInstead, perhaps the observed plomas are a function of the product of the dilution factors and the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, maybe the number of plomas is given by the product of the dilution factors and the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP = (dilution factor) * (recombination frequency)\n\nBut that\u2019s speculative. Alternatively, the number of plomas is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nGiven that, the number of plomas on strain B is 4, and on strain K is 40. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5 respectively.\n\nAssuming that plomas scale with the dilution factor, then:\n\nP_B / P_K = (1e7) / (1e5) \u2192 100\n\nWhich matches the given data: 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is approximately 100.\n\nTherefore, plomas are proportional to the dilution factor. This suggests that the recombination frequency is consistent across both samples, as the difference is accounted for by the dilution.\n\nSince the number of plomas scales linearly with dilution, the recombination frequency must be such that the effect is consistent across both samples. Therefore, the recombination frequency likely corresponds to the difference in plomas per unit dilution.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can use the following reasoning:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage alone produces a certain number of plomas.

    "chunk_resampled": "Hmm, let's break this down.",
    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, let's break this down. If the two mutants are recombining, their offspring would have a mutation that's a mix of both. Since lysogenic phages are typically more common and stable, but here they're causing problems, maybe the combination leads to a new mutation that's present in some cells. But how does this relate to the plume counts?\n\nThe dilution factors indicate how much each sample was diluted before being plated. The higher dilution (1:10^7) means fewer cells per drop, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) has more cells. In a double-dilution assay like this, you first take a small portion from the original solution and dilute it, then transfer it into a test tube. Then you take another small portion from the same original solution and dilute it again for further testing.\n\nIn this case, if the two mutants are recombining, their offspring should be less fit than either parent. So, when you plate these offspring on the respective bacterial strains, they might die off at a certain rate. The number of plumes indicates the frequency of occurrence\u2014more plumes mean more cells showing the mutation.\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B, 40 plumes; on strain K, 4. That seems like a significant difference. It looks like the offspring formed from the combination of the two mutants are much more likely to die than those formed without recombination. If no recombination occurred, all the offspring should behave similarly, leading to similar plume frequencies regardless of the strain they're tested on. However, since there are vastly different numbers of plumes, it suggests that recombination did happen.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for recombinant frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = [(p + q)^2 - p^2 - q^2] / (p + q)^2\n\nBut wait, actually, RF is often calculated as ( (number of recombinant individuals) / total ) * 100. Here, the number of plumes on strain K is much lower than on B, indicating that the recombination events lead to lower survival rates on B and higher on K? Or vice versa. Let me think about the double-dilution method.\n\nIn a standard double-dilution assay, when a mutation occurs upon recombination, its expression is reduced compared to its wild type. So, if the lysogenic phage is wild type and the lytic is mutant, recombination would reduce the fitness of the offspring. Therefore, when you plate them on the host, they would die more often.\n\nIf the two mutants are independent, their combined effect would be additive, so the expected number of plumes would depend on the probabilities of each mutation. However, in this case, the plume count on B is much higher than on K, suggesting that the recombination event reduces survival on B significantly more than on K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because K is another strain. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's correct this. The lysogenic phage is wild type, and the lytic is mutant. If they recombine, their offspring would have a mutation that makes them worse than wild type. So, when you plate them on E. coli strain B, which is typically resistant unless the mutation allows lysis, the offspring should die more often. Similarly, when plated on E. coli strain K, which may have a different resistance profile, perhaps the recombination leads to better survival or worse.\n\nIn the given data, on B, 40 plumes; on K, 4. So, the recombination leads to much lower plumes on B, meaning the offspring are worse on B, and better on K? Or worse on K? Wait, maybe I got it reversed. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is wild type and the lytic is mutant, recombination would produce a phage that is worse than wild type. So, when you plate it on B, which is typically resistant, the phages would lyse the cells and cause death. Similarly, when you plate it on K, depending on K's resistance, the phages could die or survive differently.\n\nBut according to the data, the recombination leads to more plumes on B (40) than on K (4), which suggests that the recombination event is more lethal on B and less lethal on K. Alternatively, maybe the opposite\u2014it depends on the context. Perhaps K has a different selection pressure, making the recombination event more favorable on K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants affects the survival differently on each strain. To determine the degree of recombination, we can use the ratio of plumes.\n\nThe general approach is to assume that the probability of recombination (r) determines the survival rate of the offspring. If r=0, there's no recombination, and the offspring replicate perfectly. As r increases, the offspring's viability decreases.\n\nIn a double-dilution assay, the number of surviving colonies (or plumes) is proportional to (1 - r)^n, where n is the number of dilutions. For example, in double-dilution, you'd expect approximately (1 - r)^2 survival on each strain.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes is inversely related to survival. Lower numbers mean higher survival, higher numbers mean lower survival.\n\nSo, for strain B, 40 plumes; for strain K, 4 plumes. Assuming that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to survival, then:\n\nSurvival_B = 40/(40+4) \u2248 87.5%\n\nSurvival_K = 4/(4+40) \u2248 9.09%\n\nAssuming that survival is roughly (1 - r)^2, then:\n\n(1 - r)^2 \u2248 Survival_B => 1 - r \u2248 sqrt(0.875) \u2248 0.935 => r \u2248 6.5%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - r)^2 \u2248 Survival_K => 1 - r \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.301 => r \u2248 69.9%\n\nThis inconsistency suggests an issue with the assumption. Maybe the survival ratios aren't exactly squared terms due to varying dilution factors or other variables.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ratio of plumes is indicative of the relative effects of recombination. The lower plume count on strain K suggests that the recombination event is more severe on K than on B. But since K is another strain, perhaps it's under different conditions.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes on the two strains. The number of plumes on B is four times greater than on K, implying that the recombination event is more detrimental on B. Therefore, the recombination rate must be high enough to cause such a pronounced difference in survival rates between the two strains.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n(r) = [sqrt(Survival_B) - sqrt(Survival_K)]\u00b2 / [1 - sqrt(Survival_B) + sqrt(Survival_K)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSv_B = 40/44 \u2248 0.909\n\nSv_K = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nsqrt(Sv_B) \u2248 0.953\n\nsqrt(Sv_K) \u2248 0.301\n\nr = (0.953 - 0.301)^2 / (1 - 0.953 + 0.301)\n\n\u2248 (0.652)^2 / (0.348)\n\n\u2248 0.425 / 0.348 \u2248 1.225 \u2192 122.5%\n\nThat's impossible because r cannot exceed 100%. This suggests a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try a simpler method. If the number of plumes is proportional to the susceptibility, and the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, perhaps the recombination rate is such that the susceptibility factor is 10x higher on K. Recombination rates are typically measured in terms of the percentage of recombinants. For instance, 1% recombination would lead to a 10x increase in susceptibility.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, it implies that the susceptibility (and thus recombination) is 10x higher on K. Therefore, the recombination rate is approximately 1%, as 1% recombination would lead to a 10x increase in susceptibility.\n\nThus, the answer would be A. 1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. If the two mutants are recombining, their offspring would have a mutation that's a mix of both. Since lysogenic phages are typically more common and stable, but here they're causing problems, maybe the combination leads to a new mutation that's present in some cells. But how does this relate to the plume counts?\n\nThe dilution factors indicate how much each sample was diluted before being plated. The higher dilution (1:10^7) means fewer cells per drop, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) has more cells. In a double-dilution assay like this, you first take a small portion from the original solution and dilute it, then transfer it into a test tube. Then you take another small portion from the same original solution and dilute it again for further testing.\n\nIn this case, if the two mutants are recombining, their offspring should be less fit than either parent. So, when you plate these offspring on the respective bacterial strains, they might die off at a certain rate. The number of plumes indicates the frequency of occurrence\u2014more plumes mean more cells showing the mutation.\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B, 40 plumes; on strain K, 4. That seems like a significant difference. It looks like the offspring formed from the combination of the two mutants are much more likely to die than those formed without recombination. If no recombination occurred, all the offspring should behave similarly, leading to similar plume frequencies regardless of the strain they're tested on. However, since there are vastly different numbers of plumes, it suggests that recombination did happen.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for recombinant frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = [(p + q)^2 - p^2 - q^2] / (p + q)^2\n\nBut wait, actually, RF is often calculated as ( (number of recombinant individuals) / total ) * 100. Here, the number of plumes on strain K is much lower than on B, indicating that the recombination events lead to lower survival rates on B and higher on K? Or vice versa. Let me think about the double-dilution method.\n\nIn a standard double-dilution assay, when a mutation occurs upon recombination, its expression is reduced compared to its wild type. So, if the lysogenic phage is wild type and the lytic is mutant, recombination would reduce the fitness of the offspring. Therefore, when you plate them on the host, they would die more often.\n\nIf the two mutants are independent, their combined effect would be additive, so the expected number of plumes would depend on the probabilities of each mutation. However, in this case, the plume count on B is much higher than on K, suggesting that the recombination event reduces survival on B significantly more than on K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because K is another strain. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's correct this. The lysogenic phage is wild type, and the lytic is mutant. If they recombine, their offspring would have a mutation that makes them worse than wild type. So, when you plate them on E. coli strain B, which is typically resistant unless the mutation allows lysis, the offspring should die more often. Similarly, when plated on E. coli strain K, which may have a different resistance profile, perhaps the recombination leads to better survival or worse.\n\nIn the given data, on B, 40 plumes; on K, 4. So, the recombination leads to much lower plumes on B, meaning the offspring are worse on B, and better on K? Or worse on K? Wait, maybe I got it reversed. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is wild type and the lytic is mutant, recombination would produce a phage that is worse than wild type. So, when you plate it on B, which is typically resistant, the phages would lyse the cells and cause death. Similarly, when you plate it on K, depending on K's resistance, the phages could die or survive differently.\n\nBut according to the data, the recombination leads to more plumes on B (40) than on K (4), which suggests that the recombination event is more lethal on B and less lethal on K. Alternatively, maybe the opposite\u2014it depends on the context. Perhaps K has a different selection pressure, making the recombination event more favorable on K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants affects the survival differently on each strain. To determine the degree of recombination, we can use the ratio of plumes.\n\nThe general approach is to assume that the probability of recombination (r) determines the survival rate of the offspring. If r=0, there's no recombination, and the offspring replicate perfectly. As r increases, the offspring's viability decreases.\n\nIn a double-dilution assay, the number of surviving colonies (or plumes) is proportional to (1 - r)^n, where n is the number of dilutions. For example, in double-dilution, you'd expect approximately (1 - r)^2 survival on each strain.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes is inversely related to survival. Lower numbers mean higher survival, higher numbers mean lower survival.\n\nSo, for strain B, 40 plumes; for strain K, 4 plumes. Assuming that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to survival, then:\n\nSurvival_B = 40/(40+4) \u2248 87.5%\n\nSurvival_K = 4/(4+40) \u2248 9.09%\n\nAssuming that survival is roughly (1 - r)^2, then:\n\n(1 - r)^2 \u2248 Survival_B => 1 - r \u2248 sqrt(0.875) \u2248 0.935 => r \u2248 6.5%\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(1 - r)^2 \u2248 Survival_K => 1 - r \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.301 => r \u2248 69.9%\n\nThis inconsistency suggests an issue with the assumption. Maybe the survival ratios aren't exactly squared terms due to varying dilution factors or other variables.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ratio of plumes is indicative of the relative effects of recombination. The lower plume count on strain K suggests that the recombination event is more severe on K than on B. But since K is another strain, perhaps it's under different conditions.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes on the two strains. The number of plumes on B is four times greater than on K, implying that the recombination event is more detrimental on B. Therefore, the recombination rate must be high enough to cause such a pronounced difference in survival rates between the two strains.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n(r) = [sqrt(Survival_B) - sqrt(Survival_K)]\u00b2 / [1 - sqrt(Survival_B) + sqrt(Survival_K)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSv_B = 40/44 \u2248 0.909\n\nSv_K = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nsqrt(Sv_B) \u2248 0.953\n\nsqrt(Sv_K) \u2248 0.301\n\nr = (0.953 - 0.301)^2 / (1 - 0.953 + 0.301)\n\n\u2248 (0.652)^2 / (0.348)\n\n\u2248 0.425 / 0.348 \u2248 1.225 \u2192 122.5%\n\nThat's impossible because r cannot exceed 100%. This suggests a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try a simpler method.

Since we have two different concentrations (dilutions), we can model this as a ratio. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, which means the first sample has 1e-7 cells/mL and the second has 1e-5. \n\nThe probability of recombination would depend on how often the mutants interact.

To calculate that, you can use the ratio of the dilution factors. The higher dilution (1e-5) corresponds to the strain K, and the lower (1e-7) is B. The idea is that if there's complete recombination, the products would be like a double mutation, which shouldn't replicate well. The observed plume counts suggest some combination occurred, leading to less than expected.\n\nThe calculation typically uses the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant fusions = (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2)\n\nWhere N1 and N2 are the dilution factors. Plugging in 1e-5 and 1e-7 gives us (1e-5 * 1e-7)/(1e-5 + 1e-7) \u2248 9.96e-13. That's an extremely low number, meaning almost no recombination occurred.

The expected number of recombinant fusions under complete independence would be the product of the probabilities. Here, the dilution factors give the probabilities as 1e-5 and 1e-7.

The higher concentration (1e-5) has a lower frequency of mutants compared to 1e-7. If they recombine, this should decrease the overall effectiveness. The observed outcome is that on strain B, there are more plumes than expected, suggesting the lysogenic phage is still causing issues, implying some recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we consider the difference in dilution factors. The higher factor (1e-5) is about 1/100th of the lower (1e-7). If recombination happens, say x% of the time, then the combined effect would be less than the sum. The observed data shows that the lysogenic phage isn't as effective, so recombination must have occurred.\n\nCalculating the recombination rate: Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the two frequencies. With recombination, the actual count is less. Using the formula:\n\nRecombination rate = (log(N1) - log(N2)) / (log(1e-7) - log(1e-5))\n\nThis simplifies to log(N1/N2) / log(1e2) = (-5 +7)/2=1, so 10^(1/2)=~31.6%. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nAnother approach: The recombination fraction \u03c6 can be estimated using the number of recombinants R and the total number of possible combinations C. R = \u03c6 * C. Here, the observed R is 40 on B and 4 on K. Assuming equal chances, the total possible combinations are (number on B)^2 + (number on K)^2, but that's not straightforward.

Hmm, maybe the dilution affects the probability of getting plasmids? Or perhaps it's about the number of phages that replicate?\n\nLet me recall how E. coli resistance works. Normally, if you have multiple phages causing issues, their combination can lead to resistance via recombination. Each mutation provides a certain level of resistance, and the recombination rate determines how often the mutations interact.\n\nIn the case of E. coli, when a lysogenic phage and an integrative phage coexist, their combination can result in either an active phage (if they cause a change in replication) or a resistant phage (if they disrupt replication or integrate without causing a change). Here, since only the lysogenic phage is problematic for strain B, the presence of both phages may cause some form of resistance.\n\nThe experiment uses different dilutions and litters. Dilution factor 1:10^7 would mean fewer cells are plated, increasing the chance of plating a new phage. Similarly, 1:10^5 is even less dilute. The fact that 4 plumes appeared on K suggests that the less-diluted sample (strain K) had higher concentrations of the second mutation, possibly due to recombination where one phage from strain B and another from strain K combine.\n\nRecombination rate is typically measured as the percentage of recombinant offspring produced when two parents undergo crossing over during gamete formation. In phage experiments, the recombination rate can be determined by looking at the distribution of different genotypes in the offspring.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to the number of plumes observed? Plumes represent successful infections. If the lower dilution (1:10^5) has more plumes than the higher dilution (1:10^7), it suggests that the lower dilution was more likely to produce successful infections, implying a higher frequency of the second mutation being present in those cells.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes should follow a Poisson distribution based on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote p1 and p2 as the frequencies of the two mutations. Since the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain K, we can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of plumes on K = p1 * p2 * N\n\nWhere N is the total number of colonies plated. However, in this case, the ratio of plumes on K to B depends on the relative frequencies of the mutations.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would depend on p1 * p2. But since the lower dilution shows more plumes, it implies that p1 * p2 is higher in the lower dilution group compared to the higher dilution group.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Poisson process, the number of successes (plumes) follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = \u03bc, where \u03bc is the expected number of events. For two mutations, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to p1 * p2.\n\nGiven that the lower dilution (1:10^5) resulted in more plumes than the higher dilution (1:10^7), let's assume that p1 * p2 increases with dilution, indicating that the lower dilution has a higher proportion of the second mutation.\n\nTo find the exact recombination rate, we might need to calculate the expected number of recombinants under the assumption of no interference and then compare it to what was observed.\n\nHowever, without detailed calculations, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage. But given the options provided, I'll make an educated guess based on typical recombination rates. Recombination rates in phages are usually quite low, on the order of a few percent.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up the terms here. The first part says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So each half is treated separately. One half is more dilute (1:10^7) and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other half is less dilute (1:10^5) and plated on strain K's lawn. Then four plumes appeared on K, and 40 on B. Hmm, maybe the dilution affects the probability of getting plasmids? Or perhaps it's about the number of phages that replicate?\n\nLet me recall how E. coli resistance works. Normally, if you have multiple phages causing issues, their combination can lead to resistance via recombination. Each mutation provides a certain level of resistance, and the recombination rate determines how often the mutations interact.\n\nIn the case of E. coli, when a lysogenic phage and an integrative phage coexist, their combination can result in either an active phage (if they cause a change in replication) or a resistant phage (if they disrupt replication or integrate without causing a change). Here, since only the lysogenic phage is problematic for strain B, the presence of both phages may cause some form of resistance.\n\nThe experiment uses different dilutions and litters. Dilution factor 1:10^7 would mean fewer cells are plated, increasing the chance of plating a new phage. Similarly, 1:10^5 is even less dilute. The fact that 4 plumes appeared on K suggests that the less-diluted sample (strain K) had higher concentrations of the second mutation, possibly due to recombination where one phage from strain B and another from strain K combine.\n\nRecombination rate is typically measured as the percentage of recombinant offspring produced when two parents undergo crossing over during gamete formation. In phage experiments, the recombination rate can be determined by looking at the distribution of different genotypes in the offspring.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to the number of plumes observed? Plumes represent successful infections. If the lower dilution (1:10^5) has more plumes than the higher dilution (1:10^7), it suggests that the lower dilution was more likely to produce successful infections, implying a higher frequency of the second mutation being present in those cells.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes should follow a Poisson distribution based on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote p1 and p2 as the frequencies of the two mutations. Since the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain K, we can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of plumes on K = p1 * p2 * N\n\nWhere N is the total number of colonies plated. However, in this case, the ratio of plumes on K to B depends on the relative frequencies of the mutations.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would depend on p1 * p2. But since the lower dilution shows more plumes, it implies that p1 * p2 is higher in the lower dilution group compared to the higher dilution group.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Poisson process, the number of successes (plumes) follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = \u03bc, where \u03bc is the expected number of events. For two mutations, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to p1 * p2.\n\nGiven that the lower dilution (1:10^5) resulted in more plumes than the higher dilution (1:10^7), let's assume that p1 * p2 increases with dilution, indicating that the lower dilution has a higher proportion of the second mutation.\n\nTo find the exact recombination rate, we might need to calculate the expected number of recombinants under the assumption of no interference and then compare it to what was observed.\n\nHowever, without detailed calculations, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage. But given the options provided, I'll make an educated guess based on typical recombination rates. Recombination rates in phages are usually quite low, on the order of a few percent. Looking back at the options, option G is 0.5 percent, which seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Maybe the lysogenic phage is more effective at inducing a lytic cycle in some parts of the genome, while the recombined phage somehow affects strain K differently. The high ratio of plumes on K compared to B suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't work as well against K, possibly because their DNA has been recombined with another part of the genome, making it less efficient for the lysogenic pathway. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we consider the probability that the two mutations occurred close enough in the genome to interact.

If the lysogenic phage was more effective against strain B, but less so against K, the recombination might have reduced its efficacy against K. Assuming recombination reduces the effectiveness, the percentage of recombination needed to go from 40 to 4 would be quite high. \n\nLet me try calculating the log of the ratio. ln(40/4)=ln(10)=2.3. Using the formula RF=10^(\u2212(distance)/(2N)) where distance is measured in map units and N is the number of chromosomes, but without specific distances, it's hard.

If there was no recombination, we'd expect an equal number of plumes from both regions because each mutation would independently cause the same effect. However, if there's some interaction or recombination, the distribution might be skewed towards one region more than the other.\n\nLet me think about how plumes work. In a double mutant system, if the two mutations are independent, you'd expect an equal number of plumes from each lawn. For example, if both mutants are equally likely to cause issues, you'd see roughly the same number of plumes from both strains. But if there's recombination, meaning the presence of one mutation affects the likelihood of another, you might get more plumes from one strain than the other.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is causing problems in strain B, while the lytic phage is fine in strain B but affects strain K. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage in the lysogenist region could influence the lysogenic phage in strain B. Similarly, the lytic phage in strain K might affect the lysogenic phage in strain K. Wait, actually, the lysogenic phage isn't affected by the lytic phage; it's the lytic phage that's not affected by the lysogenic phage. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The lysogenic phage (like the one that does lysis) doesn't replicate inside the E. coli, so it's unaffected by the lytic phage. On the other hand, the lytic phage (which doesn't lyse the cell) is affected by the lysogenic phage. So, in the experiment, strain B has both types of phages. The lysogenic phage in strain B doesn't replicate, so it should be safe, explaining why only the lysogenic phage in strain K (the lytic phage) is causing issues.\n\nNow, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage in strain B is interacting with the lytic phage in strain K. Because if the lysogenic phage in strain B didn't interact with anything, all plumes would come from either strain K or nothing, but since strain B is mostly affected, there must be some interaction.\n\nThe numbers given are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. This is a significant difference\u2014more plumes on strain B. Wait, no, wait: 4 on K and 40 on B? No, the problem says \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Oh, sorry, no: It's four on K and forty on B. So, more plumes on B. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage in strain B is being replicated in the presence of the lytic phage in strain K, leading to more replication and thus more plumes.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the interaction between different genetic elements. In this case, the lysogenic phage in strain B and the lytic phage in strain K. If these two are recombining, then their interactions would lead to specific patterns in the number of plumes.\n\nIn a typical double mutant system without any interference, the number of plumes would depend on the probability of each mutation occurring. If recombination occurs, the occurrence of each mutation is dependent on the presence of the other mutation. So, the expected number of plumes would be higher where both mutations are active.\n\nGiven the data, we have more plumes on strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage in B is being replicated more often due to interaction with the lytic phage in K. Alternatively, if the lytic phage in K is causing some inhibition of the lysogenic phage in B, that could also lead to more plumes.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Probability of no recombination)\n\nAssuming independence initially, the expected number of plumes would be similar for both strains. However, with recombination, the distribution shifts.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the probabilities for each strain are:\n\nFor strain B:\nP(B) = (1 - R) * p + R * q\n\nWhere p is the probability of the lysogenic phage in B (no recombination), and q is the probability of the lysogenic phage in K (no recombination).\n\nSimilarly for strain K:\nP(K) = (1 - R) * r + R * s\n\nWhere r and s are the probabilities for K.\n\nHowever, in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage in B is influenced by the lytic phage in K, implying that there is some recombination between them.\n\nLooking at the actual number of plumes, we can infer the degree of recombination. Since there are more plumes on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage in B is being replicated more often, possibly because it is being influenced by the lytic phage in K.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in a double mutant, the number of plumes follows a binomial distribution, assuming independence. But when there's recombination, the distribution becomes non-uniform.\n\nThe ratio of plumes from B to K can give us an idea of the recombination frequency. If there's perfect recombination, the plume counts would be determined entirely by whether each strain has a mutation. But in reality, with recombination, there's a certain overlap.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the expected number of plumes when recombination occurs, the ratio can help determine R.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the number of plumes on B is much higher, indicating that the lysogenic phage in B is more likely to be replicated, which suggests that the lysogenic phage in K is inhibiting its replication. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest possible is 5%, followed by 3% and 2%. Since the answer choices go up to 5%, and the correct answer seems to be around 1-2%, let's see.\n\nWait, no. The number of plumes indicates that the interaction is more significant. With more plumes on B, it's likely that there's a moderate level of recombination. Let me think again.\n\nIn a typical scenario without any interference, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. However, when there's recombination, the effective probabilities change.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes when there's partial recombination. If R is the recombination frequency, the probability of a plume coming from B is (1 - R) * p + R * q, and similarly for K.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's tricky. However, in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage in B is being influenced by the lytic phage in K, which implies that there is some interaction, i.e., recombination.\n\nSo, considering that, the recombination frequency is probably relatively high, say 5%, which corresponds to option G (0.5%).\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the initial numbers: 4 on K and 40 on B. That's a 10x difference. If there's a 5% recombination, that means that 95% of the time, the mutations don't interfere, and 5% of the time, they do. So, the presence of 5% recombination would mean that 95% of the lysogenic phages in B are unaffected by the lysogenic phages in K, and 5% are being repelled, leading to more plumes on B.\n\nThis aligns with the observation that B has many more plumes than K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is around 5%.\n\nSo, the answer should be G. 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

However, with recombination, the distribution shifts.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the probabilities for each strain are:\n\nFor strain B:\nP(B) = (1 - R) * p + R * q\n\nWhere p is the probability of the lysogenic phage in B (no recombination), and q is the probability of the lysogenic phage in K (no recombination).\n\nSimilarly for strain K:\nP(K) = (1 - R) * r + R * s\n\nWhere r and s are the probabilities for K.\n\nHowever, in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage in B is influenced by the lytic phage in K, implying that there is some recombination between them.\n\nLooking at the actual number of plumes, we can infer the degree of recombination. Since there are more plumes on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage in B is being replicated more often, possibly because it is being influenced by the lytic phage in K.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in a double mutant, the number of plumes follows a binomial distribution, assuming independence. But when there's recombination, the distribution becomes non-uniform.\n\nThe ratio of plumes from B to K can give us an idea of the recombination frequency. If there's perfect recombination, the plume counts would be determined entirely by whether each strain has a mutation. But in reality, with recombination, there's a certain overlap.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the expected number of plumes when recombination occurs, the ratio can help determine R.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the number of plumes on B is much higher, indicating that the lysogenic phage in B is more likely to be replicated, which suggests that the lysogenic phage in K is inhibiting its replication. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest possible is 5%, followed by 3% and 2%. Since the answer choices go up to 5%, and the correct answer seems to be around 1-2%, let's see.\n\nWait, no. The number of plumes indicates that the interaction is more significant. With more plumes on B, it's likely that there's a moderate level of recombination. Let me think again.\n\nIn a typical scenario without any interference, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. However, when there's recombination, the effective probabilities change.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes when there's partial recombination. If R is the recombination frequency, the probability of a plume coming from B is (1 - R) * p + R * q, and similarly for K.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's tricky. However, in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage in B is being influenced by the lytic phage in K, which implies that there is some interaction, i.e., recombination.\n\nSo, considering that, the recombination frequency is probably relatively high, say 5%, which corresponds to option G (0.5%).\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the initial numbers: 4 on K and 40 on B. That's a 10x difference. If there's a 5% recombination, that means that 95% of the time, the mutations don't interfere, and 5% of the time, they do. So, the presence of 5% recombination would mean that 95% of the lysogenic phages in B are unaffected by the lysogenic phages in K, and 5% are being repelled, leading to more plumes on B.\n\nThis aligns with the observation that B has many more plumes than K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is around 5%.\n\nSo, the answer should be G. 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, plumes mean colonies that have taken up the phage DNA. So on strain B's lawn, most of the cells should be dead because only lysogenic phages do damage. But the experiment shows 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems contradictory unless the presence of lysogenic phages somehow affects the replication of the lysogenic phage itself or something like that. Maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated more efficiently or causing some interference?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's effect on the lysogenic phage is causing some recombination. If the lysogenic phage has its own mutation, maybe it integrates into another phage, increasing the chance of recombination. Or maybe the lysogenic phage is causing some stressors that affect the lysogenic phage's replication.\n\nLet me think about how recombination works. Recombination typically occurs when two different phages integrate their genes into each other, leading to a new phage. In this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't killing E. coli, but when mixed with another type, the number of plumes changes. \n\nIn pure lysogenic phages, you'd expect fewer plumes because they don't replicate as much. But here, even with a mix, we're seeing some plumes on strain B. So maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B is somehow affecting the lysogenic phage in strain K? Like, if the lysogenic phage on B is replicating more efficiently, it might interfere with the replication of the lysogenic phage on K, causing more plumes on K. \n\nThe dilutions matter too. Diluting 1:10^5 is more dilute than 1:10^7. Dilution affects the likelihood of successful infection. More dilution means a lower chance of the phage infecting the cell, so more time until it does. Since the lysogenic phage is less likely to cause lytic fission, it might take longer to infect, meaning more plumes over time. \n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage on B reduces the chance of the lysogenic phage on K successfully replicating because of some interference. This could indicate that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination. \n\nNow, considering the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's roughly an 8:1 ratio. Since plumes are proportional to the frequency of successful infections, a higher number on one side might suggest a stronger interaction. But how does that translate to recombination percentage?\n\nRecombination rate is often calculated using the formula:\n\nRecomb% = (R1 + R2 - 2*(R1*R2)/(R1+R2)) *100%\n\nWhere R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions for each gene pair. Alternatively, sometimes people use the number of plumes to estimate the probability of recombination. \n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes given no recombination. If there was no recombination, we would see a certain distribution. With recombination, the distribution shifts. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B, but not K, perhaps the presence of lysogenic phage on B increases the chance of recombination between the two types. \n\nIf the recombination rate is low, say 0.05%, then the probability of recombination occurring during the growth phase would be very low. But in our case, the number of plumes increased on B, suggesting that the presence of lysogenic phage on B makes the lysogenic phage on K more susceptible, indicating more potential for recombination.\n\nSo, let's consider possible recombination rates. The options given are percentages in increments of 0.1%. Looking at the answer choices, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc. \n\nTo find the exact value, perhaps we can model it. Suppose the recombination fraction is r. Then, the expected number of plumes depends on r. For example, without recombination, the expectation might be a certain number, and with recombination, it shifts. \n\nIf the observed ratio is 40 vs 4, that's a significant difference. Assuming that the expected number without recombination is N, then the observed number is influenced by r. \n\nUsing the formula for plume counts under recombination, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 + r), assuming that recombination doubles the effectiveness. So, if without recombination, the count is N, with recombination, it becomes 2N. But in our case, it's 40 vs 4, which is 10 times. Hmm, that doesn't fit directly.\n\nMaybe it's better to think in terms of probabilities. The probability that a phage infects a cell is p = 1/(1+dilution factor). For a dilution factor of 10^5, p \u2248 0.00001 (since 1e-5 is 0.00001). Similarly, for 1e7, p\u22480.0000001. \n\nHowever, when multiple phages are present, the success probability decreases due to interference. The expected number of successful infections is n * p * (1 - p'), where p' is the interference factor. \n\nBut this might get complicated. Instead, perhaps we can look for a relationship between the number of plumes and the recombination rate. \n\nLooking back, the initial experiment showed that when both mutantphages are present, the number of plumes on each lawn varies. Specifically, on strain B's lawn, there are more plumes (40) compared to strain K's lawn (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage on B is somehow interfering with the replication of the lysogenic phage on K, possibly through recombination. \n\nGiven the dilution factors, the lysogenic phage on B is more effective (lower dilution factor) and thus more likely to infect more cells, leading to more plumes. However, these plumes are specifically on strain B's lawn, which already has the lysogenic phage, so why are they appearing on strain B's lawn and not on strain K's? \n\nWait, actually, all the plumes are on strain B's lawn except those on strain K. Wait, no\u2014the description says: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the other half is on strain B, while the first half is on strain K. Therefore, the 40 plumes on B's lawn are from the mixture, and the 4 on K's lawn are from the pure K's. \n\nThis indicates that the mixture caused more plumes on B's lawn, implying that the lysogenic phage on B is somehow affecting the replication of the lysogenic phage on K. Perhaps due to recombination, the lysogenic phage on B integrates into the lysogenic phage on K, making it more susceptible to replication. \n\nTherefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage on B leads to enhanced replication efficiency of the lysogenic phage on K, resulting in more plumes. This suggests that the two mutations are interacting via recombination, possibly at a low rate. \n\nTo determine the exact recombination percentage, we can set up a proportion. Let\u2019s assume that the recombination rate is r. Without recombination, the number of plumes would be N. With recombination, it might increase or decrease. Given that the number of plumes increased on B's lawn, it suggests that recombination occurred on B's lawn. \n\nAssuming that the recombination rate is r, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 + r). So, if without recombination, the number of plumes is N, with recombination, it would be N*(1 + r). \n\nFrom the data, on B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, which is 10 times more than expected without recombination (assuming N=4). So, 40 = 4*(1 + r), solving for r gives us r = 9. This seems impossible because recombination rates cannot exceed 100%. Clearly, my assumption is wrong. \n\nPerhaps the relationship is different. Maybe the expected number is inversely related. Let's try N / (1 + r) = observed. So 4 / (1 + r) = 40 \u2192 1 + r = 0.1 \u2192 r = -0.9. Negative recombination rate doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nAlternative approach: The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. Assuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would be equal on both lawns, but with recombination, it's adjusted. \n\nIf recombination occurs on B's lawn, it might increase the number of plumes on B's lawn relative to K's. Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination fraction. The expected number of plumes on B's lawn would be N_B = N_K * (1 + r), where N_K is the number without recombination. \n\nGiven N_B = 40 and N_K = 4, 40 = 4*(1 + r) \u2192 1 + r = 10 \u2192 r = 9. Again, this is impossible. So perhaps the relationship is different. \n\nWait, maybe the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. So N_B = N_K / (1 + r). Plugging in: 40 = 4 / (1 + r) \u2192 1 + r = 0.1 \u2192 r = -0.9. Still negative. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct way is to think in terms of the product of the probabilities. The probability that a phage infects a cell is p = 1/(1 + d), where d is the dilution factor. For 1e5, p\u22480.00001; for 1e7, p\u22480.0000001. \n\nThe expected number of successful infections is n * p * (1 - q), where q is the interference factor. Assuming q \u2248 1 for simplicity, the expected number is n * p * (1 - 1) = 0. So without recombination, there's no expected infection. But with recombination, it's possible, but the expectation might still be low.\n\nHowever, in reality, recombination can increase the probability of successful infection slightly. So the observed number of plumes on B's lawn is higher than expected due to recombination. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the recombination rate is small. Let's test r = 0.1% (option D).\n\nThen, the probability of recombination is 0.001. \n\nThe expected number of plumes on B's lawn would be N_B = N_K * (1 + r), but scaled by the dilution factors. Since dilution is involved, the actual number of plumes would depend on the dilution effects. \n\nBut without getting bogged down in calculations, the fact that there are 40 plumes on B's lawn, which is significantly higher than the 4 on K's, suggests that recombination happened. Among the options, 0.1% (D) and 0.05% (E) are low rates. 0.02% (I) and 0.05% (E) are also low. 0.1% (D) is plausible for a rare recombination event.\n\nConsidering that, I'll go with option D, 0.1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. The plate shows that half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, yielding 4 plumes. That makes sense because the more dilution (1:10^5), the less likely a phage would cause a plume on a strain B lawn, while the same for K. Wait, but if the phage is lysogenic, it might have a different effect depending on the host.\n\nBut let's focus on the recombination aspect. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages, leading to changes in their replication and expression. In the case of T_4 phages, if two mutations are present on the T_4 genome, they can either be on the same gene (no recombination) or on different genes (recombination). If they're recombined, the offspring phage may have different numbers of lysogenic variants compared to the parent.\n\nIn this experiment, when both mutant types are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage might replicate normally, causing more plasmids and potentially lysing the E. coli. But if they do recombine, the lysogenic variant could have different properties.\n\nThe key here is determining how many times the two mutations interact during replication. Each mutation can occur once per phage, and if they recombine, that creates a new combination. The number of plasmids produced from each phage type will affect whether they interfere.\n\nIn the scenario, the first half (plated on strain B) had 40 plumes, suggesting that most phages replicated successfully without interference. The second half (plated on strain K) had 4 plumes, indicating fewer successful replications. This difference implies that the two mutants are interfering with each other's replication. The exact relationship between the number of plumes and the degree of recombination can be determined using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = 1 + m * n\n\nWhere m and n are the number of copies of each mutation per phage. However, since we're dealing with probabilities, we can use the expected number of plumes to infer the probability of recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then each phage has an equal chance of causing a plume. But if they recombine, their chances change. Alternatively, the number of plumes can indicate the frequency of the recombinant type.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K, it suggests that the probability of recombination is high enough that the lysogenic phage is less effective on strain K than expected. Let's assume that each mutation occurs at a certain rate, say p for each mutation. Without recombination, the total number of plumes would be higher because each phage produces multiple copies. With recombination, the expected number decreases.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of plumes under complete independence:\n\nExpected plumes = (m + n)^2 / (m + n) ) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Maybe better to think in terms of probabilities. For each plume on strain B, the probability that it's due to the lysogenic phage is related to the presence of the lysogenic mutation. Similarly for strain K.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the probability that a given plume comes from a phage with both mutations (recombined) would be p * q, where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. If they recombine, the combined probability increases.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the likelihood of recombination. The observed ratio of plumes on the two strains can help determine the degree of recombination.\n\nThe formula to calculate the likelihood of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = (number of plumes on K - expected)/ (total possible)\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the odds ratio. The ratio of plumes on K to B gives insight into the likelihood of recombination.\n\nHere, there are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That's a ratio of 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10% of B's plumes. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (on K) is much less likely to replicate without interference than on B. How does this translate to recombination?\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage on K would produce fewer plumes because it's less likely to survive replication. Conversely, on B, the lysogenic phage is more effective, producing more plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination fraction, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability of lysogenic mutation in phage A\n- q = probability of lysogenic mutation in phage B\n- r = recombination fraction (probability that the two mutations are on the same gene)\n\nWhen recombination occurs, the phage carries both mutations, so the total number of plumes produced is influenced by both.\n\nWithout recombination, the expected number of plumes would be higher, but with recombination, the number decreases.\n\nHowever, calculating the exact recombination fraction requires knowing the probabilities of each mutation and the occurrence of recombination. Since the problem provides specific counts, we can reverse-engineer the recombination fraction.\n\nFrom the experiment, the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Assuming that each plume represents a single copy of the lysogenic phage, the ratio of plumes reflects the relative success rates of the two strains.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), the lysogenic phage would be equally likely to infect both strains, resulting in similar plume densities. But in reality, there are more plumes on B, meaning the lysogenic phage is more efficient on B, implying that the lysogenic phage on B is more likely to survive without interference.\n\nRecombination would reduce the efficiency of the lysogenic phage on one strain more than the other. Given the significant drop in plumes on K (from 40 to 4), the lysogenic phage on K is much less likely to replicate successfully, suggesting that recombination has occurred.\n\nTo quantify the recombination fraction, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p * q) / (p * q + p * (1-q) + (1-p)*(q) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Instead, we can use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the number of phages. Alternatively, we can use the following simplified method:\n\nThe number of plumes is inversely proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. Higher numbers imply lower probabilities of recombination.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is much lower, the probability of recombination must be high.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes when recombination occurs. Suppose that each mutation occurs with probability p and q, respectively. If they recombine, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p*q. Without recombination, it's either p or q.\n\nThe expected number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to p, and on strain K, proportional to q. However, if they recombine, the actual numbers depend on the combined probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to consider the ratio of plumes as indicative of the recombination fraction. The ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that recombination is quite frequent.\n\nTo convert this ratio into a percentage, we can assume that the recombination fraction R relates to the ratio of plumes as follows:\n\nR \u2248 (1 - (ratio)) / (1 + (ratio))\n\nBut I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, the formula for the recombination fraction based on plume ratios is:\n\nR = (1 - (plume_B / (plume_B + plume_K))) / (1 + (plume_B / (plume_B + plume_K)))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nplume_B = 40, plume_K = 4\nTotal = 44\nRatio = 40/44 \u2248 0.909\n\nR = (1 - 0.909)/(1 + 0.909) \u2248 (0.091)/(1.909) \u2248 0.048, which is approximately 0.05 or 0.5%. But this seems low, considering the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, another formula is:\n\nR = (plume_K / plume_B) / ((plume_K / plume_B) + 1)\n\nSo,\n\nR = 4/40 / (4/40 + 1) = 0.1 / 1.1 \u2248 0.09, which is about 0.09 or 0.09%.\n\nStill low. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A to H include various percentages up to 5%, including 0.5%, 0.1%, etc. The correct answer is likely around 2% or 0.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the number of lysogenic phages. On B, 40 plumes mean the lysogenic phage is more active, implying no recombination. On K, 4 plumes suggest less activity, implying recombination. The ratio of 40:4 is 10:1, meaning the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less effective, which suggests that recombination has reduced its activity significantly.\n\nIf the two mutations are on separate genes (no recombination), the lysogenic phage on B would be more active. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage on K would be less active. The exact recombination fraction can be calculated using the formula for the ratio of plumes:\n\nR = (1 - (plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B))) / (1 + (plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)))\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nR = (plume_B) / (plume_B + 2 * plume_K)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nR = 40 / (40 + 8) = 40/48 \u2248 0.833, which is about 83%. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because the options go down to 0.1%.\n\nHmm, perhaps my formula is incorrect. Another approach is to use the formula for the recombination fraction when you know the probabilities:\n\nIf the probability of recombination is R, then the expected number of plumes on K would be proportional to (1 - R) * p, and on B it would be (1 - R) * q. But without knowing p and q, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plumes can be modeled as:\n\n(1 - R) = plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - R) = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nThus,\n\nR = 1 - 0.0909 \u2248 0.909, which is 90.9%, but that contradicts the options. Clearly, I\u2019m making a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nWhich would give R = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.09, so 9%. But again, the options don't have 9%. Alternatively, it's R = plume_K / plume_B = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the correct formula for the recombination fraction when measuring plume density is:\n\nR = plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nSo,\n\nR = 4 / (4 + 40) = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is 9%. But the closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). None match exactly. However, the calculation might require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expected number of plumes when recombining is higher, but in our case, the opposite is happening\u2014more plumes on B, suggesting less recombination. Thus, the recombination fraction is low.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is D (0.1%) or C (1.5%). My calculation gave ~9%, which isn't listed, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)) * 100%\n\nWhich would be 9%, but none of the options are close. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the number of plumes corresponds to the probability of the lysogenic phage surviving replication. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage on B would replicate and cause more plumes. If there's recombination, the lysogenic phage on K might have a lower survival rate.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage on B would have a higher chance of replication, thus more plumes. With recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would have a lower chance, hence fewer plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes (4 vs 40) suggests that the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate, implying a high degree of recombination.\n\nTo model this, suppose that the probability of recombination is R. Then, the probability of the lysogenic phage on K being effective is (1 - R) * q, where q is the probability of the mutation in K. Similarly, for B, it's (1 - R) * p.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's hard to compute R directly.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. If they recombine, the probability of the lysogenic phage carrying both mutations is p*q. If they don't recombine, it's either p or q.\n\nThe expected number of plumes would be higher without recombination because the lysogenic phage can replicate more effectively. With recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would have a lower replication rate, reducing the number of plumes.\n\nGiven that the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1, the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate. This suggests that the recombination fraction is such that the probability of recombination is high enough to reduce the replication efficiency by a factor of 10.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nProbability of lysogenic phage on K replicating = (1 - R) * q\n\nSimilarly, for B: (1 - R) * p\n\nIf without recombination, (1 - R)*p > (1 - R)*q, meaning p > q.\n\nBut in this case, since the lysogenic phage on B is more active, perhaps p > q. Therefore, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that (1 - R) * q / [(1 - R) * p] = q/p = 0.1, so q = 0.1 p.\n\nBut without knowing p and q individually, it's difficult to determine R.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction R can be approximated by the ratio of plumes minus 1 over the sum:\n\nR \u2248 (plume_K - 1) / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 1)/44 = 3/44 \u2248 6.8%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (plume_K - 1) / (plume_K + plume_B - 1)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 1)/(4 + 40 -1) = 3/43 \u2248 6.98%, still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination fraction. So, if the lysogenic phage on B is more active, the recombination fraction must be low.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is D (0.1%) or C (1.5%). Since 9% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C (1.5%), considering that 4/40 reduces to 1/10, which could correspond to a 10% reduction in plume density, but 1.5% is closer to 100% reduction.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different angle. The number of plumes on K is 4, on B is 40. The ratio is 10:1. This means that the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate successfully. This suggests that recombination has occurred sufficiently often that the lysogenic phage on K cannot replicate well anymore.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would replicate perfectly, giving 40 plumes. With recombination, the probability of replication drops by a factor of 10, resulting in 4 plumes. This indicates that the recombination fraction R is such that (1 - R) = 1/10, so R = 0.9. But this is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = 1 - (plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)), which would be 1 - (4/44)= 36/44\u22480.818, which is 81.8%, but that's also not an option.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Given the options, the closest I can get is D (0.1%) or C (1.5%). Since 40 plumes on B suggest no recombination, and 4 on K suggest a lot, the recombination must be high. Among the options, 1.5% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, no, the user mentioned that the results showed four plaques on K and 40 on B. But wait, the way it's written, \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So maybe the first half was on strain B, and the second on strain K? Or vice versa? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. The plate shows that half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, yielding 4 plumes. That makes sense because the more dilution (1:10^5), the less likely a phage would cause a plume on a strain B lawn, while the same for K. Wait, but if the phage is lysogenic, it might have a different effect depending on the host.\n\nBut let's focus on the recombination aspect. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages, leading to changes in their replication and expression. In the case of T_4 phages, if two mutations are present on the T_4 genome, they can either be on the same gene (no recombination) or on different genes (recombination). If they're recombined, the offspring phage may have different numbers of lysogenic variants compared to the parent.\n\nIn this experiment, when both mutant types are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage might replicate normally, causing more plasmids and potentially lysing the E. coli. But if they do recombine, the lysogenic variant could have different properties.\n\nThe key here is determining how many times the two mutations interact during replication. Each mutation can occur once per phage, and if they recombine, that creates a new combination. The number of plasmids produced from each phage type will affect whether they interfere.\n\nIn the scenario, the first half (plated on strain B) had 40 plumes, suggesting that most phages replicated successfully without interference. The second half (plated on strain K) had 4 plumes, indicating fewer successful replications. This difference implies that the two mutants are interfering with each other's replication. The exact relationship between the number of plumes and the degree of recombination can be determined using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = 1 + m * n\n\nWhere m and n are the number of copies of each mutation per phage. However, since we're dealing with probabilities, we can use the expected number of plumes to infer the probability of recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then each phage has an equal chance of causing a plume. But if they recombine, their chances change. Alternatively, the number of plumes can indicate the frequency of the recombinant type.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K, it suggests that the probability of recombination is high enough that the lysogenic phage is less effective on strain K than expected. Let's assume that each mutation occurs at a certain rate, say p for each mutation. Without recombination, the total number of plumes would be higher because each phage produces multiple copies. With recombination, the expected number decreases.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of plumes under complete independence:\n\nExpected plumes = (m + n)^2 / (m + n) ) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Maybe better to think in terms of probabilities. For each plume on strain B, the probability that it's due to the lysogenic phage is related to the presence of the lysogenic mutation. Similarly for strain K.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently, the probability that a given plume comes from a phage with both mutations (recombined) would be p * q, where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. If they recombine, the combined probability increases.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the likelihood of recombination. The observed ratio of plumes on the two strains can help determine the degree of recombination.\n\nThe formula to calculate the likelihood of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = (number of plumes on K - expected)/ (total possible)\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the odds ratio. The ratio of plumes on K to B gives insight into the likelihood of recombination.\n\nHere, there are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That's a ratio of 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10% of B's plumes. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (on K) is much less likely to replicate without interference than on B. How does this translate to recombination?\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage on K would produce fewer plumes because it's less likely to survive replication. Conversely, on B, the lysogenic phage is more effective, producing more plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination fraction, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability of lysogenic mutation in phage A\n- q = probability of lysogenic mutation in phage B\n- r = recombination fraction (probability that the two mutations are on the same gene)\n\nWhen recombination occurs, the phage carries both mutations, so the total number of plumes produced is influenced by both.\n\nWithout recombination, the expected number of plumes would be higher, but with recombination, the number decreases.\n\nHowever, calculating the exact recombination fraction requires knowing the probabilities of each mutation and the occurrence of recombination. Since the problem provides specific counts, we can reverse-engineer the recombination fraction.\n\nFrom the experiment, the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Assuming that each plume represents a single copy of the lysogenic phage, the ratio of plumes reflects the relative success rates of the two strains.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), the lysogenic phage would be equally likely to infect both strains, resulting in similar plume densities. But in reality, there are more plumes on B, meaning the lysogenic phage is more efficient on B, implying that the lysogenic phage on B is more likely to survive without interference.\n\nRecombination would reduce the efficiency of the lysogenic phage on one strain more than the other. Given the significant drop in plumes on K (from 40 to 4), the lysogenic phage on K is much less likely to replicate successfully, suggesting that recombination has occurred.\n\nTo quantify the recombination fraction, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p * q) / (p * q + p * (1-q) + (1-p)*(q) )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Instead, we can use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the number of phages. Alternatively, we can use the following simplified method:\n\nThe number of plumes is inversely proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. Higher numbers imply lower probabilities of recombination.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is much lower, the probability of recombination must be high.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes when recombination occurs. Suppose that each mutation occurs with probability p and q, respectively. If they recombine, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p*q. Without recombination, it's either p or q.\n\nThe expected number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to p, and on strain K, proportional to q. However, if they recombine, the actual numbers depend on the combined probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to consider the ratio of plumes as indicative of the recombination fraction. The ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that recombination is quite frequent.\n\nTo convert this ratio into a percentage, we can assume that the recombination fraction R relates to the ratio of plumes as follows:\n\nR \u2248 (1 - (ratio)) / (1 + (ratio))\n\nBut I'm not sure about this.

On B, 40 plumes mean the lysogenic phage is more active, implying no recombination. On K, 4 plumes suggest less activity, implying recombination.

Another approach is to use the formula for the recombination fraction when you know the probabilities:\n\nIf the probability of recombination is R, then the expected number of plumes on K would be proportional to (1 - R) * p, and on B it would be (1 - R) * q.

Clearly, I\u2019m making a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nWhich would give R = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.09, so 9%. But again, the options don't have 9%. Alternatively, it's R = plume_K / plume_B = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the number of plumes corresponds to the probability of the lysogenic phage surviving replication. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage on B would replicate and cause more plumes. If there's recombination, the lysogenic phage on K might have a lower survival rate.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage on B would have a higher chance of replication, thus more plumes. With recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would have a lower chance, hence fewer plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes (4 vs 40) suggests that the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate, implying a high degree of recombination.\n\nTo model this, suppose that the probability of recombination is R. Then, the probability of the lysogenic phage on K being effective is (1 - R) * q, where q is the probability of the mutation in K. Similarly, for B, it's (1 - R) * p.\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's hard to compute R directly.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. If they recombine, the probability of the lysogenic phage carrying both mutations is p*q. If they don't recombine, it's either p or q.\n\nThe expected number of plumes would be higher without recombination because the lysogenic phage can replicate more effectively. With recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would have a lower replication rate, reducing the number of plumes.\n\nGiven that the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1, the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate. This suggests that the recombination fraction is such that the probability of recombination is high enough to reduce the replication efficiency by a factor of 10.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nProbability of lysogenic phage on K replicating = (1 - R) * q\n\nSimilarly, for B: (1 - R) * p\n\nIf without recombination, (1 - R)*p > (1 - R)*q, meaning p > q.\n\nBut in this case, since the lysogenic phage on B is more active, perhaps p > q. Therefore, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that (1 - R) * q / [(1 - R) * p] = q/p = 0.1, so q = 0.1 p.\n\nBut without knowing p and q individually, it's difficult to determine R.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction R can be approximated by the ratio of plumes minus 1 over the sum:\n\nR \u2248 (plume_K - 1) / (plume_K + plume_B)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 1)/44 = 3/44 \u2248 6.8%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (plume_K - 1) / (plume_K + plume_B - 1)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 1)/(4 + 40 -1) = 3/43 \u2248 6.98%, still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination fraction. So, if the lysogenic phage on B is more active, the recombination fraction must be low.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is D (0.1%) or C (1.5%). Since 9% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C (1.5%), considering that 4/40 reduces to 1/10, which could correspond to a 10% reduction in plume density, but 1.5% is closer to 100% reduction.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different angle. The number of plumes on K is 4, on B is 40. The ratio is 10:1. This means that the lysogenic phage on K is 10 times less likely to replicate successfully. This suggests that recombination has occurred sufficiently often that the lysogenic phage on K cannot replicate well anymore.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage on K would replicate perfectly, giving 40 plumes. With recombination, the probability of replication drops by a factor of 10, resulting in 4 plumes. This indicates that the recombination fraction R is such that (1 - R) = 1/10, so R = 0.9. But this is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = 1 - (plume_K / (plume_K + plume_B)), which would be 1 - (4/44)= 36/44\u22480.818, which is 81.8%, but that's also not an option.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Given the options, the closest I can get is D (0.1%) or C (1.5%). Since 40 plumes on B suggest no recombination, and 4 on K suggest a lot, the recombination must be high. Among the options, 1.5% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), each mutation would have a 50% chance of being inherited. However, if there's partial recombination, say 10%, then one allele might be passed more frequently than the other.\n\nIn this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, it implies that at least one of the mutations (the lysogenic one) is linked to the lysogenic phage. But wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in the genomic region rII, which could be responsible for the lysogenic cycle. However, the fact that only the lysogenic phage is effective against strain B suggests that perhaps the lysogenic phage is the one that is actually involved in lysing the bacteria, while the wild-type phage isn't. Or maybe the presence of two types of phages complicates things.\n\nThe key here is determining the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues with strain B, it's likely that the lysogenic phage has a dominant effect. In such cases, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\np = 1 - (number of non-observed offspring / total number of offspring)\n\nBut let me think again about the dilutions. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium had 1e7 phages. The second half was less diluted, 1:10^5, so fewer phages per bacterium. This suggests that the initial cross-over might have occurred early enough in the process.\n\nSince only the lysogenic phage was effective, it's possible that the lysogenic mutation has an advantage over the wild-type. The presence of two types of phages might lead to competition, but the outcome depends on the specific mutations.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Plumes indicate successful replication of the phage inside the host. So, more plumes on K mean that the phage successfully integrated into strain K's genome more often. Since strain B was mostly affected, it might mean that the lysogenic phage integrated better into strain K's genome, implying some degree of recombination.\n\nWait, no\u2014strain B was mainly affected because only the lysogenic phage did anything. So, the lysogenic phage must be integrating into strain B's genome. The presence of two phages complicates things, possibly leading to interference or competition, but the main point is the recombination between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) can be calculated as RF = 1 - (number of observed recombinant offspring / total offspring). Here, the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B much, suggesting that the lysogenic mutation is linked to the lysogenic phage. Wait, but the lysogenic phage is carrying mutations in rII; perhaps these mutations are necessary for its activity. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate into the host's genome, and another mutation that confers resistance or something else.\n\nAlternatively, considering the results, if the lysogenic phage integrates into strain B's genome, but only partially, then the recombination between the lysogenic mutation and the wild-type might be low. But the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Wait, the T_4 genome refers to the phage DNA, right? So, the two mutations are in the T_4 phage genes.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, the strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is the one that's causing the issue. So, the lysogenic mutation is linked to the lysogenic phage, which is why it's working. Now, regarding the recombination between the two mutations\u2014the lysogenic and the wild-type\u2014on the T_4 phage DNA.\n\nIf the lysogenic mutation is present in the T_4 genome, then the recombination frequency would depend on whether the two mutations are in the same locus. If they are, and if one is beneficial, it might lead to incomplete dominance or complete linkage.\n\nWait, but the question is about the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination frequency typically refers to the proportion of gametes where the two loci are different. But in this context, we're looking at two specific mutations in the same gene (T_4 phage).\n\nHowever, from the experiment, only the lysogenic phage caused problems. So, the lysogenic mutation must confer some advantage, perhaps allowing the phage to integrate into the host genome. The presence of two types of phages may lead to competition for the phage DNA, but the outcome depends on which phage is more advantageous.\n\nGiven that strain B was mostly affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated well into strain B's genome, indicating that the mutation is associated with the lysogen. The other half was plated on strain K, showing fewer plumes, implying the lysogenic phage didn't integrate as effectively there. Therefore, the recombination between the lysogenic mutation and the wild-type in strain B's genome must be higher compared to strain K's.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency. If the lysogenic phage caused the failure in B but worked in K, then the mutation in B's genome is linked to the lysogenic phage. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, the mutation must be linked. If the recombination frequency is high, the two mutations are closely linked.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is related to the efficiency of the phage integration. If the lysogenic phage integrated more efficiently into B's genome, the recombination frequency would be lower than if it integrated less efficiently into K's genome.\n\nThe calculation for recombination frequency is:\n\nRF = 1 - (number of recombinants / total)\n\nHere, the number of recombinants would correspond to the plumes. But since only part of the population was tested in each strain, it's tricky. However, the ratio of plumes can give us an idea. Strain B had 4 plumes, and Strain K had 40. So, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 1/10, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 10%. However, this seems too high given the options provided.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the recombination between the two mutations\" in the T_4 genome. If the two mutations are in the same gene and the presence of recombination leads to some of the phages having both mutations, then the plumes represent the number of successful integrations. So, if 40 plumes are found on K, which is 10 times higher than 4 on B, that suggests that the probability of recombination is higher in K's population.\n\nBut the actual recombination frequency should be consistent across all populations unless there's selection favoring certain combinations. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues in B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is associated with the mutation in B's genome. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high, around 10%.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, 10% isn't an option. The closest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the dilution factors might play a role. The first half was 1:1e7, and the second was 1:1e5. The difference in dilution could reflect the number of gametes produced. If the phages produce fewer copies upon division, it might affect the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of recombinants in a population is (1 - R) * N, where N is the number of individuals. Given that in the first sample, N1=4/(1e7), and in the second, N2=40/(1e5)=0.004. So, N1=4e-7 and N2=0.004.\n\nIf we assume the same recombination frequency, then (1 - R)*N1 \u2248 N2. So,\n\n(1 - R)*(4e-7) \u2248 0.004\n\n=> 1 - R \u2248 0.004 / 4e-7 \u2248 10,000\n\nWhich would imply R\u2248-9999%, which is impossible. So, my assumption is wrong.\n\nInstead, perhaps the plume count reflects the number of gametes that integrated the mutation. So, the fraction of gametes that integrated the mutation is proportional to the plumes. For B, it's 4 plumes, and for K, 40. Assuming the same number of gametes, the fraction is 4/40=0.1. So, the recombination frequency is 10%.\n\nAgain, 10% isn't among the options. Looking back, the options go up to 5%, 0.5%, etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, the question specifies that the two mutants are causing the lysofission in B but not in K. It's possible that the lysogenic phage is compatible with both, but only in B is it affecting the lysogen. Alternatively, the presence of both phages creates a situation where the lysogenic phage can take over in some cases, leading to issues in K.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency might relate to the ability of the lysogenic phage to integrate into the host genome. If the recombination is high, the lysogenic phage can take over more easily, causing issues in more hosts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the efficiency of the phages' integration. The higher the efficiency, the higher the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without exact calculations, it's hard to pinpoint. However, the options suggest that the recombination frequency is relatively low, possibly around 0.1% or similar.\n\nConsidering the answer options, the highest plausible value is D (0.05%) or E (0.02%), but the most reasonable would be C (1.5%) or others. Wait, no, the correct approach is needed.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes relates directly to the number of recombinants. If in one population, you get more plumes, it suggests a higher recombination rate. But in our case, K has significantly more plumes (40 vs. 4), so the recombination rate is much higher in K's population than B's.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say around 1%, then the expected number of recombinants would be (1 - R)*N, where N is the number of individuals. Suppose N is the same in both samples. Then, (1 - R)*N1 \u2248 N2. Solving for R gives R\u22481 - (N2/N1). If N1=4e-7 and N2=0.004, then R\u22481 - (0.004/4e-7)=1 - 10,000= -9999, which isn't possible.\n\nThis suggests that the number of plumes isn't directly proportional to the recombination frequency. Instead, the presence of two phages complicates the analysis, making it harder to determine the exact recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll choose the lowest option, E (0.02%), as it represents a very low recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

If the phages produce fewer copies upon division, it might affect the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of recombinants in a population is (1 - R) * N, where N is the number of individuals. Given that in the first sample, N1=4/(1e7), and in the second, N2=40/(1e5)=0.004. So, N1=4e-7 and N2=0.004.\n\nIf we assume the same recombination frequency, then (1 - R)*N1 \u2248 N2. So,\n\n(1 - R)*(4e-7) \u2248 0.004\n\n=> 1 - R \u2248 0.004 / 4e-7 \u2248 10,000\n\nWhich would imply R\u2248-9999%, which is impossible. So, my assumption is wrong.\n\nInstead, perhaps the plume count reflects the number of gametes that integrated the mutation. So, the fraction of gametes that integrated the mutation is proportional to the plumes. For B, it's 4 plumes, and for K, 40. Assuming the same number of gametes, the fraction is 4/40=0.1. So, the recombination frequency is 10%.\n\nAgain, 10% isn't among the options. Looking back, the options go up to 5%, 0.5%, etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, the question specifies that the two mutants are causing the lysofission in B but not in K. It's possible that the lysogenic phage is compatible with both, but only in B is it affecting the lysogen. Alternatively, the presence of both phages creates a situation where the lysogenic phage can take over in some cases, leading to issues in K.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency might relate to the ability of the lysogenic phage to integrate into the host genome. If the recombination is high, the lysogenic phage can take over more easily, causing issues in more hosts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the efficiency of the phages' integration. The higher the efficiency, the higher the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without exact calculations, it's hard to pinpoint. However, the options suggest that the recombination frequency is relatively low, possibly around 0.1% or similar.\n\nConsidering the answer options, the highest plausible value is D (0.05%) or E (0.02%), but the most reasonable would be C (1.5%) or others. Wait, no, the correct approach is needed.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes relates directly to the number of recombinants. If in one population, you get more plumes, it suggests a higher recombination rate. But in our case, K has significantly more plumes (40 vs. 4), so the recombination rate is much higher in K's population than B's.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say around 1%, then the expected number of recombinants would be (1 - R)*N, where N is the number of individuals. Suppose N is the same in both samples. Then, (1 - R)*N1 \u2248 N2. Solving for R gives R\u22481 - (N2/N1). If N1=4e-7 and N2=0.004, then R\u22481 - (0.004/4e-7)=1 - 10,000= -9999, which isn't possible.\n\nThis suggests that the number of plumes isn't directly proportional to the recombination frequency. Instead, the presence of two phages complicates the analysis, making it harder to determine the exact recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll choose the lowest option, E (0.02%), as it represents a very low recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

If the two mutations recombine, the number of plumes will be reduced because the effects won't overlap as much. Without recombination, the number of plumes would equal twice the number expected from each mutation alone. With recombination, it would be less. \n\nBut let me try applying the double-reciprocal method. The formula is RF = (number of plumes in A + number in B - 2 * number in AB)/total plumes. Here, A is the 1:10^7 dilution on B, and B is the 1:10^5 dilution on K. The number in A is 40, in B is 4, and in AB is 0 because they didn't recombine.

So without recombination, you'd expect 80 plumes (40 on B, 40 on K). But we have 4 on K and 40 on B, totaling 44. This suggests that only 4 plumes overlapped, meaning 4 out of 44 are overlapping. That gives an overlap rate of 4/44 \u2248 9%, which seems low. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The correct approach is to calculate the percentage of plumes that did not overlap. If there are 4 plumes on K that didn't overlap with any on B, then the number of overlaps would be 40-4=36. Total plumes are 40+4=44. Overlap rate is 36/44\u224881.8%.

The number of plumes in the first test is 40, which is 1:10^7, implying a certain frequency. The second test has 4 plumes at 1:10^5. If recombination occurs, the number of plumes should be around half of each, minus some overlap. But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula RF = (n_A + n_B - 2n_AB)/N, where N is the total plumes. From the results, n_A=40, n_B=4, n_AB=0. So RF=(40+4)/44\u224844/44=1, which again suggests 100% recombination. But that contradicts the results because only 40 plumes on B suggest it's not complete recombination.

But here, the main point is about recombination between the two mutations themselves.\n\nIn double mutants, the probability of recombination determines how often the two mutations combine into a recombinant form.

Plugging these in:\n\nNumber of recombinants = 4 * 1e7 * 1e5 / (1e7 + 1e5)\n= 4 * 1e12 / 1.001e7 \u2248 4e12 / 1e7 \u2248 4e5\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants would be proportional to the product of the dilutions. The formula I remember is: Recombinant Frequency = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring).\n\nHere, total number of offspring would be 40 + 40 = 80? Wait no, because one half is plated on strain B and the other on K. Each half has a certain number of plumes, so the total number of plumes is 40 + 40 = 80. Of these, 40 are on K, implying that the K culture had 40 recombinants, while the B culture had 40 as well. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if all the plumes were from the same source, their numbers should match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of plumes indicates the likelihood of recombination. Since the K culture was plated on strain K, any recombinants should have been expressed on K. So if 40 plumes were found on K, that means 40 out of the total 80 plumes were recombinants. That gives a ratio of 40/80 = 0.5, or 50%. But wait, that's just the proportion of plumes on one side. To find the recombination frequency, which is typically calculated using the formula 4 * n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are the dilution factors.\n\nSo applying that formula correctly:\n\nn1 = 1e7, n2 = 1e5\n\nRecombinant frequency = (4 * 1e7 * 1e5) / (1e7 + 1e5)\n\nCalculating numerator: 4 * 1e12 = 4e12\n\nDenominator: ~1e7 (since 1e7 dominates over 1e5)\n\nSo approx 4e12 / 1e7 = 4e5\n\nBut wait, the denominator should actually be 1e7 + 1e5 = 1.001e7 \u2248 1e7 for approximation.\n\nThus, Recombinant Frequency \u2248 4e5 / 1e7 = 0.04, which is 4%.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match 4%. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 1%  \nB. 2%  \nC. 1.5%  \nD. 0.1%  \nE. 0.2%  \nF. 0.3%  \nG. 0.5%  \nH. 5%  \nI. 0.02%  \nJ. 0.05%  \nK. 0.0005%\n\nHmm, my calculation gave 4%, which isn't an option. Maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps I should consider the actual formula differently. Another way is to calculate the expected number of recombinants as (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2) multiplied by 4. But according to the formula, it's 4 * n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2). So plugging in:\n\n4 * 1e7 * 1e5 / (1e7 + 1e5) \u2248 4e12 / 1.001e7 \u2248 399,601. So approximately 400,000 recombinants.\n\nTotal offspring = 40 (on B) + 40 (on K) = 80. Wait, that contradicts earlier; if only 40 are on each, then total is 80, but 40 recombinants would imply a ratio of 50%. That can't be right because recombinants should be specific to the combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the dilution factors apply multiplicatively. So the number of plasmids transferred is 1e7 and 1e5. The chance that a plasmid is from the recombined source is proportional to the product of the dilutions. So the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be 4 * 1e7 * 1e5 / (1e7 + 1e5) \u2248 4e12 / 1e7 \u2248 4e5, which is 400,000. But the total number of plasmids is 40 (on B) + 40 (on K) = 80. That doesn't add up because 400k recombinants can't exist within 80 plasmids. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of genetic ratios. The probability of recombination is equal to the ratio of plasmids on each culture relative to the sum. So the fraction of recombinant plasmids on K is 40/(40+40) = 0.5. Similarly, on B, it's also 0.5. But this suggests that the recombination rate is 50%, which isn't an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids corresponds to the number of viable cells, so if 40 plumes are found on K, that implies 40 viable cells due to recombination. But without knowing the exact count, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options provided, 4% isn't available. The closest is H (5%) or G (0.5%). My calculation suggested around 4%, but perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the ratio of plasmids on each culture to determine the crossover rate. For example, if on K, 40 plasmids appear, and on B, 40 plasmids, then the ratio is 1:1, suggesting no recombination because the probabilities would match. This would mean that the recombinant rate is zero. But that contradicts the initial observation where some cells died.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombinants leads to increased lethality. If the recombination rate is higher, more cells die upon death of the phage. But in this experiment, the lethality isn't mentioned, so perhaps the focus is solely on the recombination itself.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinants is given by 4 * (n1 - r) * (n2 - r) / (n1 + n2), where r is the recombination rate. But I don't know r, so this might not help.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is based on the assumption that the recombination frequency is directly proportional to the ratio of plasmids. Since on K, 40 out of 80 are recombinants, the frequency is 50%, but the options don't include 50%. Therefore, the closest lower option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Given that 40 out of 80 is 50%, which is closer to 5%, but 5% isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination as (n1 * n2)/(n1 + n2) * 4, which would give 4*(1e7*1e5)/(1e7+1e5)=4e12/1e7\u22484e5. Then, the fraction is 4e5/(40+40)=4e5/80\u22485e3, which is 5000%. That makes no sense. I must be missing something fundamental here.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of recombinant plasmids is (n1 * n2)/(n1 + n2) * 4. Let's compute that:\n\n(1e7 * 1e5)/(1e7 + 1e5) = (1e12)/1.001e7 \u2248 99,900,099. Then multiply by 4: \u2248399,600,396. Now, divide by total plasmids (80): 399,600,396 / 80 \u22484,995,004.95. That\u2019s 5 million recombinant plasmids, which is impossible because each plasmid comes from a single cell. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest plausible answer based on possible miscalculations is probably C (1.5%) or D (0.1%), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering that the majority of plasmids are recombinant, the frequency could be higher. Wait, another thought: The expected number of recombinants is 4 * n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2). Plugging in:\n\n4 * 1e7 * 1e5 = 4e12  \nDivide by 1e7 + 1e5 = 1.001e7 \u22481e7  \nSo 4e12 /1e7 = 4e5  \nBut the total number of cells is 80, so 4e5 /80 =5000%. Impossible. Thus, the correct interpretation must be that the number of recombinants per cell is 4e5 /80 =5000 per cell, which is clearly wrong. Hence, the correct approach must be to realize that the number of recombinant plasmids is 4 * n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2). Since the dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, the number of recombinant plasmids would be 4 * 1e7 * 1e5 / (1e7 + 1e5) \u22484e12 /1e7=4e5. But this is still too high. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2). So 1e7 *1e5 / (1e7 +1e5)=1e12 /1.001e7\u224899,900,099. Multiply by 4 gives\u2248399,600,396. Divide by total plasmids (80):\u22484,995,004. Again, impossible. Hence, the correct interpretation must involve the possibility that the number of recombinant plasmids is negligible compared to the total, making the frequency effectively 50%. But since 50% isn't an option, I might have misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2). So 1e7 *1e5=1e12, divided by 1e7 gives 1e5. Multiply by 4 gives 4e5. Then, the frequency is 4e5 / (40 +40)=4e5/80=5000%. Impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the answer is 5%, which is option G. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is simply (n1 * n2)/(n1 +n2)*4, giving 4*(1e7 *1e5)/(1e7+1e5)=4e12/1e7=4e5. Then, the frequency is 4e5 / (40+40)=5000%, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the dilution factors and assume that the recombination rate is determined by the ratio of plasmids. Since 40 plasmids on K and 40 on B, the recombination rate is 50%, but that's not an option. Hence, perhaps the intended answer is 5%, which is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the phages are causing different behaviors\u2014lytic versus lysogenic\u2014I might expect some interference where one affects the replication of the other. In double mutants, sometimes you get interference, leading to fewer lethal combinations than expected. But here, the main point is about recombination between the two mutations themselves.\n\nIn double mutants, the probability of recombination determines how often the two mutations combine into a recombinant form. If recombination occurs, the double mutant will be more fit, so it should show fewer lethality compared to a non-recombinant double mutant. However, in this case, since the problem mentions that the same mutations are being tested separately, maybe we're looking at whether each mutation independently confers a fitness advantage when combined.\n\nThe key here seems to be calculating the frequency of recombination based on the number of plumes observed.

    "rollout": " \n\nFrom what I remember, when multiple mutants are present, their effects on each other depend on how much they interfere. If the mutations cause different outcomes, like one causing failure and another causing success, you might get a certain number of recombinants. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage did damage to strain B, perhaps it's because the lysogenic phage (mutant) caused the lysogenic effect, while the lytic phage (mutant) didn't affect strain B. But when both are present, maybe the combination leads to interference in replication or something else.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many of these mutants combine correctly to produce a recombinant effect. The dilution factors suggest that the first half was more concentrated, so any successful plasmid would have a lower chance of surviving due to higher dilution. However, the second half had a lower concentration, making it harder for the lysogenic phage to replicate without being killed by the lytic phage. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to replicate because it's already replicating inside the E. coli. So if both phages are present, the lysogenic phage should be killed by the lytic phage, right? That means strain B wouldn't be affected at all. But in the experiment, some of the strain B colonies died, so maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage isn't as harmful as I thought.\n\nWait, let me think again. Normally, lysogenic phages replicate inside the bacterial genome, leading to a stable prophage that can integrate into the host genome. Lysogenic phages don't lyse the cell, so they can persist indefinitely. Lytic phages cause DNA replication, which kills the phage if it successfully replicates. So if you have a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyse, it shouldn't kill the bacterium unless it integrates into the chromosome. But wait, in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, meaning it doesn't lyse the bacterium but instead replicates. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Actually, lysogenic phages typically cause DNA replication, not lysis. So if the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse, then it won't kill the bacterium, but it will cause DNA replication. Similarly, the lytic phage will lyse the bacterium upon replication.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage is causing lysogenic fission, which is probably replication rather than lysis. Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify: lysogenic phages usually cause DNA replication, so they don't lyse the bacterium. Lytic phages lyse the bacterium upon replication.\n\nSo in this scenario, the lysogenic phage is causing replication, and the lytic phage is causing lysis. Now, the problem states that the lysogenic phage (mutant) in strain B is causing lytic fission, but actually, I'm getting mixed up now. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nWhen both types of mutantphages are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. For example, if the lysogenic phage is trying to replicate, and the lytic phage is trying to lyse, their interactions determine whether they cause lethality or not.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is causing replication (which it shouldn't), and the lytic phage is causing lysis (which it shouldn't either), their combined effect might lead to interference. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage might not cause replication because it's being replicated by the lytic phage, or vice versa.\n\nBut in the given scenario, the lysogenic phage in strain B is causing lytic fission, which doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages usually cause replication, not lysis. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Let me double-check:\n\n- Lysogenic phage: Replicates inside the host and integrates into the genome.\n- Lytic phage: Causes DNA replication upon itself, leading to cell death.\n\nSo, in this context, the lysogenic phage (mutant) in strain B is causing lytic fission, which seems contradictory. Perhaps the term refers to the type of process, not the outcome. So regardless of the outcome, the presence of both types affects the growth rate.\n\nNow, in the experiment, the initial culture is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) has 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The second half (diluted 1:10^5) has 40 plumes on B and 0 on K. This suggests that the first half, being more concentrated, allows more plasmids to survive and replicate, while the second half, less concentrated, limits this.\n\nSince the first half has 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, that means when the concentration was high, the lysogenic phage (from the first half) was replicating better on strain B, and the lytic phage from the same half wasn't affecting strain B much. On the other hand, when the concentration is lower (second half), the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate effectively, while the lytic phage caused lysis, killing all the bacteria, including those with lysogenic phages.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage (mutant) is interacting with the lytic phage (mutant) in a way that allows the lysogenic phage to replicate within the host and integrate into the genome, while the lytic phage is causing lysis upon replication. The interaction between these two mutants likely results in a recombinant effect where the lysogenic phage successfully integrates into the host's genome, allowing it to replicate and potentially cause issues, but in this case, it's the lysogenic phage that's causing problems in strain B, which suggests that the integration is problematic.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (RF), we use the formula RF = 1 - (number of recombinants / total number of offspring). Here, the number of recombinants is 40 on K and 40 on B, totaling 80. The total number of offspring is 40 + 40 = 80. So RF = 1 - (80/80) = 0, which would imply complete linkage. But that's not possible because the experiment showed some recombinants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is causing replication, and the lytic phage is causing lysis, their interaction could lead to some cells having both, resulting in some plasmids integrating. So the number of recombinants would be the number of cells where the lysogenic phage integrated successfully, causing problems. In the first dilution, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K indicate that 44% of the cells (40+4=44) show some plasmids. In the second dilution, 40 plumes on B and 0 on K mean that none of the cells have any plasmids.\n\nUsing the formula RF = 1 - (number of recombinants / total). Number of recombinants is 40 (on B) + 0 (on K) = 40. Total is 44 + 40 = 84. So RF = 1 - (40/84) \u2248 1 - 0.476 \u2248 0.524 or 52%. That's quite high, which doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is RF = 1 - (number of non-recombinants / total). Non-recombinants are those without any plasmids. In the first dilution, 4 cells without plasmids, and 40 with. In the second dilution, 40 without, 0 with. So total non-recombinants = 4 + 40 = 44. Recombinants = 40 + 0 = 40. So RF = 1 - (44/84) \u2248 1 - 0.523 \u2248 0.477 or 47.7%, still not matching the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another way is to consider the number of successful combinations. If the presence of both mutants leads to some cells having both, but in the first dilution, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B suggest that 44% of the cells have either lysogenic phage (since 40 +4=44) or both. In the second dilution, 40 plumes on B and 0 on K mean no cells have the lysogenic phage.\n\nThus, RF = (number of cells with both mutants) / total cells. From the first dilution, 44% of the cells have both. Assuming a dilution factor of 10^7, the number of plasmids per cell is N = 1e7. If 44% of the cells have both mutants, then RF = 44%.\n\nBut none of the options are close to 44%. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate. In the first dilution, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Total plasmids = 4 + 40 = 44. Total cells = 44 * 10^7. In the second dilution, 40 on B and 0 on K. So only 40 plasmids on B. Since the lysogenic phage can't replicate in the second dilution, the remaining cells must have no plasmids. Thus, RF = 44 / (44 + 40) = 44/84 \u2248 0.5238 or 52.38%. Again, not matching any options.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the lysogenic phage is causing lysis, not replication, so the presence of both phages leads to some cells losing the lysogenic phage, hence fewer recombinants. In that case, the RF would be lower. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinants is the number of times both phages successfully integrated. In the first dilution, 40 on K and 4 on B. Total = 44. In the second dilution, 40 on B and 0 on K. Total = 40. So RF = (40) / (44 + 40) = 40/84 \u2248 0.476, about 47.6%. Still not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of successful recombinants to the total number of plasmid duplications. Each time a plasmid is duplicated, it may or may not integrate. The number of successful integrations determines the RF.\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, suggesting 44 plasmids. In the second dilution, 40 on B, implying 40 plasmids. So RF = 40/(44 + 40) \u2248 47.6%, which is not among the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is H (5%), followed by J (0.05%), etc. None are near 47.6%. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the dilution factors are misapplied. If the lysogenic phage is causing replication, and the lytic phage is causing lysis, the presence of both could lead to some cells dying or having both phages.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinants)/(total number of cells). If in the first dilution, 40 on B and 4 on K, that's 44 cells. In the second dilution, 40 on B and 0 on K, that's 40 cells. So total recombinants = 40, total cells = 84. RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%, which still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, maybe the answer considers the efficiency of the plating. The first dilution was plated at 1:10^7, which is more efficient than 1:10^5. Efficiency can affect the number of viable plasmids. Suppose the first dilution allowed more plasmids to replicate, leading to more recombinants. But I'm not sure how this ties into the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the ratio of successful integrations. The number of successful integrations is 40 on B and 0 on K. So total recombinants = 40, total cells = 40 + 44 = 84. RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the question asks for the percentage of recombinants relative to the total number of cells, which is indeed around 47.6%. None of the options are close to that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation. Maybe the number of recombinants is 40, and the total is 40 + 44 = 84. So RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the closest is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the role of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, going back to the question: \"the resultingly saturated the lawn of E. coli strain B\". Saturated means that all susceptible cells die. If only the lysogenic phage was present, strain B would die. With both phages, some cells died. The data shows that in the first dilution, 40 on B and 4 on K. So in the presence of both phages, 44 cells died (4 on B and 40 on K). Wait, no\u2014actually, 4 on B and 40 on K would sum to 44 cells dead. But the total number of cells is 44 (first dilution) plus 40 (second dilution), totaling 84. So 44 dead, 40 alive. So RF = 44/84 \u2248 52.38%. Not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is looking for the number of successful combinations, which would be 40 on B and 0 on K, giving 40 recombinants out of 84 total cells, which simplifies to approximately 47.6%. None of the options match this, so perhaps the intended answer is based on the ratio of the number of successful integrations to the total number of attempts, which is 40/84 \u2248 47.6%, which rounds to 48%. But the options don't include this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again: A to H, with E options starting from 0.02%. The closest is D (0.05%) and E (0.2%). But my calculation is around 47.6%, which is nowhere near these percentages. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the presence of both phages causes interference, leading to a certain number of recombinants. The ratio of recombinants to the total number of offspring is the RF. If only the lysogenic phage was present, strain B dies. With both phages, some cells survived. The number of plasmids that successfully replicated and integrated is determined by the interaction between the two mutants.\n\nAssuming that each plasmid has a 50% chance of integrating, the expected number of recombinants would be 0.5 * 84 = 42. But the actual number observed is 40 on B and 4 on K. So 40 on B, which would correspond to 40 successful integrations on strain B. Thus, the RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%.\n\nAgain, this doesn't align with the options. It seems I'm consistently arriving at a RF of around 48%, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation, such as considering the efficiency of plating or the role of the lytic phage.\n\nWait, another possibility: The number of successful recombinants is the difference between the number of plasmids in each dilution. First dilution: 40 on B and 4 on K, so 36 recombinants. Second dilution: 40 on B, so 0 recombinants. But this doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is causing replication, which is less efficient than the lytic phage. So the presence of both phages reduces the likelihood of successful replication, leading to fewer recombinants. But I'm not sure how this affects the RF calculation.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible answer based on the calculations is around 48%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach. Maybe the number of recombinants is calculated as the difference in plasmids between the two experiments. In the first experiment, 40 on B; in the second, 0 on B. So 40 recombinants on B, but total cells are 84. RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%. Still not matching.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the percentage of cells that lost the lysogenic phage, which would be 40 on B and 40 on K. Total dead cells = 40 + 40 = 80.alive cells = 44 + 40 = 84. So RF = 80/84 \u2248 95.2%, which isn't relevant. Alternatively, the percentage of recombinants is 40/84, as before.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is based on the number of successful plasmid duplications, which is 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. RF = 44/84 \u2248 52.38%, still not matching. Maybe the correct answer is based on the ratio of the number of successful plasmids to the total, which is 40/84 \u2248 47.6%, but this isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different method, like counting the number of plasmids that successfully integrated, which would be 40 on B, leading to a percentage of 40/84",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nFrom what I remember, when multiple mutants are present, their effects on each other depend on how much they interfere. If the mutations cause different outcomes, like one causing failure and another causing success, you might get a certain number of recombinants. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage did damage to strain B, perhaps it's because the lysogenic phage (mutant) caused the lysogenic effect, while the lytic phage (mutant) didn't affect strain B. But when both are present, maybe the combination leads to interference in replication or something else.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many of these mutants combine correctly to produce a recombinant effect. The dilution factors suggest that the first half was more concentrated, so any successful plasmid would have a lower chance of surviving due to higher dilution. However, the second half had a lower concentration, making it harder for the lysogenic phage to replicate without being killed by the lytic phage. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to replicate because it's already replicating inside the E. coli. So if both phages are present, the lysogenic phage should be killed by the lytic phage, right? That means strain B wouldn't be affected at all. But in the experiment, some of the strain B colonies died, so maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage isn't as harmful as I thought.\n\nWait, let me think again. Normally, lysogenic phages replicate inside the bacterial genome, leading to a stable prophage that can integrate into the host genome. Lysogenic phages don't lyse the cell, so they can persist indefinitely. Lytic phages cause DNA replication, which kills the phage if it successfully replicates. So if you have a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyse, it shouldn't kill the bacterium unless it integrates into the chromosome. But wait, in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, meaning it doesn't lyse the bacterium but instead replicates. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Actually, lysogenic phages typically cause DNA replication, not lysis. So if the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse, then it won't kill the bacterium, but it will cause DNA replication. Similarly, the lytic phage will lyse the bacterium upon replication.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage is causing lysogenic fission, which is probably replication rather than lysis. Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify: lysogenic phages usually cause DNA replication, so they don't lyse the bacterium. Lytic phages lyse the bacterium upon replication.\n\nSo in this scenario, the lysogenic phage is causing replication, and the lytic phage is causing lysis. Now, the problem states that the lysogenic phage (mutant) in strain B is causing lytic fission, but actually, I'm getting mixed up now. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nWhen both types of mutantphages are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. For example, if the lysogenic phage is trying to replicate, and the lytic phage is trying to lyse, their interactions determine whether they cause lethality or not.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is causing replication (which it shouldn't), and the lytic phage is causing lysis (which it shouldn't either), their combined effect might lead to interference. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage might not cause replication because it's being replicated by the lytic phage, or vice versa.\n\nBut in the given scenario, the lysogenic phage in strain B is causing lytic fission, which doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages usually cause replication, not lysis. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Let me double-check:\n\n- Lysogenic phage: Replicates inside the host and integrates into the genome.\n- Lytic phage: Causes DNA replication upon itself, leading to cell death.\n\nSo, in this context, the lysogenic phage (mutant) in strain B is causing lytic fission, which seems contradictory. Perhaps the term refers to the type of process, not the outcome. So regardless of the outcome, the presence of both types affects the growth rate.\n\nNow, in the experiment, the initial culture is split into two halves. One half is plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) has 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The second half (diluted 1:10^5) has 40 plumes on B and 0 on K. This suggests that the first half, being more concentrated, allows more plasmids to survive and replicate, while the second half, less concentrated, limits this.\n\nSince the first half has 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, that means when the concentration was high, the lysogenic phage (from the first half) was replicating better on strain B, and the lytic phage from the same half wasn't affecting strain B much. On the other hand, when the concentration is lower (second half), the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate effectively, while the lytic phage caused lysis, killing all the bacteria, including those with lysogenic phages.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage (mutant) is interacting with the lytic phage (mutant) in a way that allows the lysogenic phage to replicate within the host and integrate into the genome, while the lytic phage is causing lysis upon replication. The interaction between these two mutants likely results in a recombinant effect where the lysogenic phage successfully integrates into the host's genome, allowing it to replicate and potentially cause issues, but in this case, it's the lysogenic phage that's causing problems in strain B, which suggests that the integration is problematic.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (RF), we use the formula RF = 1 - (number of recombinants / total number of offspring). Here, the number of recombinants is 40 on K and 40 on B, totaling 80. The total number of offspring is 40 + 40 = 80. So RF = 1 - (80/80) = 0, which would imply complete linkage. But that's not possible because the experiment showed some recombinants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is causing replication, and the lytic phage is causing lysis, their interaction could lead to some cells having both, resulting in some plasmids integrating. So the number of recombinants would be the number of cells where the lysogenic phage integrated successfully, causing problems. In the first dilution, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K indicate that 44% of the cells (40+4=44) show some plasmids. In the second dilution, 40 plumes on B and 0 on K mean that none of the cells have any plasmids.\n\nUsing the formula RF = 1 - (number of recombinants / total). Number of recombinants is 40 (on B) + 0 (on K) = 40. Total is 44 + 40 = 84. So RF = 1 - (40/84) \u2248 1 - 0.476 \u2248 0.524 or 52%. That's quite high, which doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is RF = 1 - (number of non-recombinants / total). Non-recombinants are those without any plasmids. In the first dilution, 4 cells without plasmids, and 40 with. In the second dilution, 40 without, 0 with. So total non-recombinants = 4 + 40 = 44. Recombinants = 40 + 0 = 40. So RF = 1 - (44/84) \u2248 1 - 0.523 \u2248 0.477 or 47.7%, still not matching the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another way is to consider the number of successful combinations. If the presence of both mutants leads to some cells having both, but in the first dilution, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B suggest that 44% of the cells have either lysogenic phage (since 40 +4=44) or both. In the second dilution, 40 plumes on B and 0 on K mean no cells have the lysogenic phage.\n\nThus, RF = (number of cells with both mutants) / total cells. From the first dilution, 44% of the cells have both. Assuming a dilution factor of 10^7, the number of plasmids per cell is N = 1e7. If 44% of the cells have both mutants, then RF = 44%.\n\nBut none of the options are close to 44%. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).

In the second dilution, 40 on B and 0 on K. So only 40 plasmids on B. Since the lysogenic phage can't replicate in the second dilution, the remaining cells must have no plasmids. Thus, RF = 44 / (44 + 40) = 44/84 \u2248 0.5238 or 52.38%. Again, not matching any options.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the lysogenic phage is causing lysis, not replication, so the presence of both phages leads to some cells losing the lysogenic phage, hence fewer recombinants. In that case, the RF would be lower. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinants is the number of times both phages successfully integrated. In the first dilution, 40 on K and 4 on B. Total = 44. In the second dilution, 40 on B and 0 on K. Total = 40. So RF = (40) / (44 + 40) = 40/84 \u2248 0.476, about 47.6%. Still not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of successful recombinants to the total number of plasmid duplications.

The number of successful integrations determines the RF.\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, suggesting 44 plasmids. In the second dilution, 40 on B, implying 40 plasmids.

RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%, which still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, maybe the answer considers the efficiency of the plating. The first dilution was plated at 1:10^7, which is more efficient than 1:10^5. Efficiency can affect the number of viable plasmids. Suppose the first dilution allowed more plasmids to replicate, leading to more recombinants. But I'm not sure how this ties into the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the ratio of successful integrations. The number of successful integrations is 40 on B and 0 on K. So total recombinants = 40, total cells = 40 + 44 = 84. RF = 40/84 \u2248 47.6%.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",

Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing some instability in the lysogenic phage itself? Or maybe the combination of the two phages leads to more replication or something. Alternatively, the recombination could be about how their mutations influence each other during replication.\n\nThe key here is probably figuring out the number of recombinant phages that lead to the observed outcomes. If the phages caused by mutation A (say, the lysogenic variant) and mutation B (the lytic variant) combine, then the recombinant phage would have both mutations. The presence of recombination would mean that some of the phages have both mutations, leading to increased expression or something else.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the outcome depends on whether the phages are compatible or not. If they are compatible, maybe they don't affect each other as much, but if they are incompatible, certain combinations might behave differently. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is affecting strain B, maybe the lysogenic phage from another type isn't interacting well with it, or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the results: half the cells are plated on strain B's lawn (with 40 plumes), and half on strain K's (with 4 plumes). Strain K has fewer plumes, suggesting less activity, which implies higher recombination because more recombined phages would replicate more effectively, leading to more successful infections. Wait, no\u2014if recombination increases the chance of successful infection, then lower numbers of plumes suggest less recombination. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections occurred. If recombination occurs, some phages will have both mutations, making them more effective. So if recombination happens, you'd expect more plumes, right? Because more phages successfully infecting the cells.\n\nBut in the experiment, half the cells (on strain B) show 40 plumes, while the other half (on strain K) show only 4 plumes. That seems like a big difference\u2014more plumes on strain B than on strain K. Which would imply that strain B is being affected more, meaning that the lysogenic phage is working better there due to some interaction. Maybe the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing some issues in strain B, indicating some recombination between the two types of phages.\n\nIf there's recombination, the number of successful infections should increase, so you might see more plumes in both groups, but here on strain B, it's significantly higher. On strain K, it's low, so maybe recombination is reducing the effectiveness for strain K. That suggests that recombination is happening in the opposite way, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is combining with the lysogenic from strain B, making more effective phages.\n\nThe total number of plumes depends on the frequency of the recombinant phages. Each plume represents an independent successful infection. So if you have a lot of recombinants, you get more plumes. Here, on strain B, it's 40 plumes, which is ten times more than 4 on strain K. Ten times more suggests a significant increase in the number of successful infections, implying a high level of recombination.\n\nRecombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1/(n+1)),\n\nwhere n is the number of recombinant individuals. However, in this context, we're dealing with plasmid counts rather than frequencies. Another approach is to use the formula for the number of recombinant plasmids:\n\nNumber of recombinant plasmids = (Total plasmids)^2 * Recombination Fraction.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to think in terms of plasmid copy number. Suppose each original phage contributes a certain number of plasmids. If there's recombination, some phages carry both mutations, increasing the likelihood of successful infection.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the fraction of recombinant phages as r. Then, the expected number of successful infections would depend on r. For example, if r is 0.1, then 10% of phages are recombinant, and the success rate would increase accordingly.\n\nGiven that the plume count is proportional to the number of recombinant phages, we can set up a ratio. Let\u2019s say the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K it's 4. Assuming that the increase comes from recombination, and considering that the plumes are inversely related to the dilution factor (since higher dilution means fewer plumes), we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. So the first group was plated at a higher concentration, and the second at a lower concentration. The plume density should decrease with higher dilution, assuming the same underlying conditions. Since strain B shows more plumes (40 vs. 4), it must be that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing more activity in strain B, possibly due to some interaction.\n\nThe relationship between plume density and recombination can be modeled by the formula:\n\nPlume Density \u221d (Recombinant Phage Count)^2 / Total Plaques.\n\nBut without knowing the exact model, we can approximate. The number of plumes on strain B is ten times higher than on strain K, but the dilution factors differ. To find the recombination frequency, we can assume that the increase in plume density is due to the increased probability of successful infection from recombinant phages.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the plume density is proportional to the square root of the number of recombinant phages. Then, sqrt(40) \u2248 6.32 for strain B and sqrt(4) = 2 for strain K. The ratio is approximately 3.16, which is close to 3. So, if the plume density increases by a factor of 10, the number of recombinant phages must have increased by 9 (since 10^(1/2)=3.16).\n\nThis suggests that the number of recombinant phages on strain B is nine times higher than on strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is such that when you dilute, the probability increases by a factor of 10, leading to nine times more recombinants. This implies that recombination occurs in 9% of cases, but wait, that's too high. Alternatively, the recombination frequency (as a decimal) squared equals the ratio, so r^2 = 0.04 (since 4/100=0.04), so r\u22480.2. That makes sense because 0.2^2=0.04.\n\nSo, the recombination frequency is approximately 0.2, which corresponds to 0.2%. Looking at the options, E is 0.05%, and D is 0.02%. 0.2% isn't listed exactly, but E is closer (0.05%) and D is 0.02%. The closest is E, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, if the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, then if strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10. So (r_B)^2 / (r_K)^2 = 10. Taking square roots, r_B / r_K = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. So if r_K is 1 (assuming no recombination), then r_B\u22483.16. But in reality, both strains experience the same recombination process, so the ratio should reflect the same frequency. Thus, if strain B's plume density is 10 times that of strain K, the recombination frequency is sqrt(10)\u22483.16, which is about 3-4%. But none of the options match that. The closest is F (0.3%), which is 0.3%. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is 0.05 (E) or 0.02 (D), perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reciprocal. If the plume density is proportional to the square root of the number of recombinants, then the ratio of plume densities is (sqrt(r_B) / sqrt(r_K))^2 = r_B / r_K. So if strain B has 40 and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10. So sqrt(r_B) / sqrt(r_K) = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. Thus, r_B = (sqrt(10))^2 * r_K = 10*r_K. So the number of recombinant phages on strain B is 10 times that on strain K. Now, if the recombination frequency is r, then the number of recombinant phages on strain B is r * N_total, where N_total is the total number of phages. Similarly for strain K. But without knowing N_total, we can\u2019t directly calculate r. However, the ratio of recombinant phages is r_B / r_K = 10. Since r_B = r * N_total and r_K = r * N_total (same total), the ratio is 10 = (r * N_total) / (r * N_total) \u2192 10=1, which is impossible. Therefore, my initial assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the increase in plume density is due to the increased probability of successful infection from recombinant phages. If the plume density is proportional to the number of successful infections, and successful infections are influenced by recombination, then the increase in plume density reflects the recombination efficiency.\n\nAssuming that the number of successful infections is proportional to the square of the number of recombinant phages (due to independent probabilities), then the ratio of plume densities would be (r_B)^2 / (r_K)^2 = 40/4 = 10. Taking square roots, r_B / r_K = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. Therefore, r_B = 3.16 * r_K. But since both strains are under the same recombination conditions, r_B should equal r_K, which contradicts this unless r_K is zero, which isn't the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, let's consider that the increase in plume density is due to the increased ability of recombinant phages to infect. The number of recombinant phages per cell determines the number of successful infections. So, if the number of recombinant phages increases by a factor of x, the number of successful infections (plumes) increases by x^2.\n\nGiven that on strain B, plumes are 10 times those on strain K, sqrt(10)\u22483.16. So the number of recombinant phages on strain B is approximately three times that on strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is such that when you dilute, the probability of successful infection increases by this factor. The recombination frequency is the probability that a phage carries both mutations, so if it's r, then the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is r + (1-r)*p, where p is the probability of the other mutation. But this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant phages on strain B is 10 times that on strain K. If both strains experience the same recombination process, the number of recombinant phages per cell is the same, so the difference must come from the dilution effect. Diluting more reduces the chance of successful infection, but here it's increasing, which suggests more recombination. Perhaps the recombination frequency is higher in the second sample (strain B) compared to the first (strain K). But without specific data, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the result showed four plumes on strain B and four on strain K. The plume density on B is much higher, suggesting more successful infections, which likely comes from more recombinant phages. The fact that strain K had fewer plumes suggests that the lysogenic phages from strain K are interfering more, possibly due to some interaction causing the lysogenic phage to have issues in the lysogenic host.\n\nGiven all this, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is around 0.2%, corresponding to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Or maybe the combination of the two phages leads to more replication or something.

Ten times more suggests a significant increase in the number of successful infections, implying a high level of recombination.\n\nRecombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1/(n+1)),\n\nwhere n is the number of recombinant individuals. However, in this context, we're dealing with plasmid counts rather than frequencies. Another approach is to use the formula for the number of recombinant plasmids:\n\nNumber of recombinant plasmids = (Total plasmids)^2 * Recombination Fraction.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to think in terms of plasmid copy number.

So, if the plume density increases by a factor of 10, the number of recombinant phages must have increased by 9 (since 10^(1/2)=3.16).\n\nThis suggests that the number of recombinant phages on strain B is nine times higher than on strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is such that when you dilute, the probability increases by a factor of 10, leading to nine times more recombinants. This implies that recombination occurs in 9% of cases, but wait, that's too high. Alternatively, the recombination frequency (as a decimal) squared equals the ratio, so r^2 = 0.04 (since 4/100=0.04), so r\u22480.2.

The closest is E, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, if the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency, then if strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10. So (r_B)^2 / (r_K)^2 = 10. Taking square roots, r_B / r_K = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. So if r_K is 1 (assuming no recombination), then r_B\u22483.16.

So if strain B has 40 and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10. So sqrt(r_B) / sqrt(r_K) = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. Thus, r_B = (sqrt(10))^2 * r_K = 10*r_K. So the number of recombinant phages on strain B is 10 times that on strain K. Now, if the recombination frequency is r, then the number of recombinant phages on strain B is r * N_total, where N_total is the total number of phages. Similarly for strain K. But without knowing N_total, we can\u2019t directly calculate r. However, the ratio of recombinant phages is r_B / r_K = 10. Since r_B = r * N_total and r_K = r * N_total (same total), the ratio is 10 = (r * N_total) / (r * N_total) \u2192 10=1, which is impossible.

Taking square roots, r_B / r_K = sqrt(10)\u22483.16. Therefore, r_B = 3.16 * r_K. But since both strains are under the same recombination conditions, r_B should equal r_K, which contradicts this unless r_K is zero, which isn't the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, let's consider that the increase in plume density is due to the increased ability of recombinant phages to infect. The number of recombinant phages per cell determines the number of successful infections.

So the number of recombinant phages on strain B is approximately three times that on strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is such that when you dilute, the probability of successful infection increases by this factor. The recombination frequency is the probability that a phage carries both mutations, so if it's r, then the probability of a phage carrying either mutation is r + (1-r)*p, where p is the probability of the other mutation. But this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant phages on strain B is 10 times that on strain K.

If they don't recombine, each phage type would independently cause issues. But since the E. coli strain B shows more problems, maybe the lysogenic phage is causing the issue here. However, the presence of both phages complicates things.\n\nThe key formula for recombinant DNA testing is D = 100 * [P1 + P2 - PQ], where Q is the expected frequency under no recombination. Wait, actually, another approach is using the equation D = 100*(P1 + P2 - 2*PQ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the expected number of double plumes when there's no recombination. If there's no recombination, then each phage would act independently. So in pure lytic, you'd get 10^7 plumes; in pure lysogenic, 10^5. But since they're mixed, perhaps the double plumes depend on how often their effects interact.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed data: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, 4. That seems like a lot fewer on K than on B. Maybe the lysogenic phage is interacting with the lytic phage, leading to less independent replication. Wait, but how does that translate to recombinant frequency?\n\nAnother way: If there's perfect recombination, all phages would cause issues together, so the number of double plumes would be higher. If there's no recombination, each phage acts independently. The observed double plumes could help determine the level of recombination.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating recombinant frequency (RF): RF = (Double plumes / Total possible) * 100%. The total possible double plumes would be the product of the dilution factors of the two media. Here, the first medium is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5. So the total possible double plumes would be 10^7 * 10^5 = 10^12. But wait, that's too high. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the sum of the dilutions plus one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is RF = (D) / [(a+1)(b+1)] * 100%, where D is double plumes, a and b are the dilution factors. In this case, a=10^7 and b=10^5. So D=40 on B and 4 on K. But wait, how many double plumes did we see? Each test plate has one plume, so each media plate represents a single test. Since the samples are divided, maybe the double plumes come from combinations where one plume is from one plate and another from another. So the total possible double plumes would be (10^7 + 10^5 +1)*(10^7 + 10^5 +1) minus the cases where neither comes from the same plate. But that's complicated.\n\nMaybe an easier way is to consider that when there's complete recombination, every phage would cause issues together, so the number of double plumes would correspond to the number of such interactions. Given that on strain B, there are 40 plumes and on K, 4, it's likely that the interaction is significant. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe looking up the standard method for calculating recombination frequencies with multiple phages isn't helpful now. Perhaps I should think about the ratio of double plumes to the expected maximum.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the expected number of double plumes would be low. With recombination, it increases. The formula for recombinant frequency when dealing with two phages is:\n\nRF = (Double plumes) / (Total possible without recombination)\n\nIf there's no recombination, the maximum double plumes would occur when the phages don't interfere. But in reality, when they do interfere, the double plumes decrease.\n\nGiven that we have 40 on B and 4 on K, let's assume that the interaction leads to a certain percentage of double plumes. Maybe the recombination frequency is around 5% as seen in some similar experiments. Looking at the options, C is 1.5%, H is 5%.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you mix two phages, the probability of recombination is inversely related to the number of plumes. Higher recombination means fewer plumes, indicating that the phages are working together more effectively. So if the double plumes are much lower, it suggests high recombination.\n\nLooking at the ratios: 40 vs 4. It's exactly 10 times lower. If the recombination is high enough to make this happen, say 5%, then the expected double plumes would be proportional to the recombination rate. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is 5%, meaning 5% of the time they work together, which would lead to more double plumes. But in our case, the double plumes are 40 vs 4, which is 10 times fewer. So maybe the recombination frequency is 0.05%? Or 0.5%?\n\nWait, another approach: The formula for D (double plumes) is given by D = 100 * (a + b - 2ab)/(a*b + a + b + 1). But I'm not confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to calculate the expected number of double plumes without recombination and compare it to the observed. If there's no recombination, the expected D would be (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1 = (10^7 +1)(10^5 +1) -1 \u2248 10^12. But in reality, we have only 40 and 4, which are way smaller. So perhaps the correct formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The number of double plumes depends on the degree of interaction. For two phages, the expected number of double plumes without any interaction is zero. With interaction, it's one. But with more interaction, it's higher. However, in practice, when you have two phages, sometimes you get double plumes because both are active. But in this experiment, the main issue is with the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The answer choices suggest that it's somewhere around 1-2%, which corresponds to option B or F. Option G is 0.5%, which is also plausible. But I'm not sure which one it is. Another thought: if there's complete recombination, you'd expect almost all plumes to form double plumes. But in our case, only 40 on B and 4 on K. So 40 on B implies that the lysogenic phage caused issues on 40% of the plates, while on K, only 1% caused issues. That suggests that the lysogenic phage worked well on B, but poorly on K, indicating that they recombine partially.\n\nWait, another angle: The number of double plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K. If there was no recombination, the expected number would be the sum of the individual plume counts because each phage acting alone would cause issues. But in reality, it's lower, suggesting that they interact more.\n\nSo maybe the recombination frequency is around 1-2%. Looking back at the options, B is 2%, which sounds reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, what do these numbers mean? Plumes indicate successful replication, right? So if the lysogenic phage interacts with the lytic phage, it might replicate better. If they don't recombine, each phage type would independently cause issues. But since the E. coli strain B shows more problems, maybe the lysogenic phage is causing the issue here. However, the presence of both phages complicates things.\n\nThe key formula for recombinant DNA testing is D = 100 * [P1 + P2 - PQ], where Q is the expected frequency under no recombination. Wait, actually, another approach is using the equation D = 100*(P1 + P2 - 2*PQ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the expected number of double plumes when there's no recombination. If there's no recombination, then each phage would act independently. So in pure lytic, you'd get 10^7 plumes; in pure lysogenic, 10^5. But since they're mixed, perhaps the double plumes depend on how often their effects interact.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed data: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, 4. That seems like a lot fewer on K than on B. Maybe the lysogenic phage is interacting with the lytic phage, leading to less independent replication. Wait, but how does that translate to recombinant frequency?\n\nAnother way: If there's perfect recombination, all phages would cause issues together, so the number of double plumes would be higher. If there's no recombination, each phage acts independently. The observed double plumes could help determine the level of recombination.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating recombinant frequency (RF): RF = (Double plumes / Total possible) * 100%. The total possible double plumes would be the product of the dilution factors of the two media. Here, the first medium is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5. So the total possible double plumes would be 10^7 * 10^5 = 10^12. But wait, that's too high. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the sum of the dilutions plus one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is RF = (D) / [(a+1)(b+1)] * 100%, where D is double plumes, a and b are the dilution factors. In this case, a=10^7 and b=10^5. So D=40 on B and 4 on K. But wait, how many double plumes did we see? Each test plate has one plume, so each media plate represents a single test. Since the samples are divided, maybe the double plumes come from combinations where one plume is from one plate and another from another. So the total possible double plumes would be (10^7 + 10^5 +1)*(10^7 + 10^5 +1) minus the cases where neither comes from the same plate. But that's complicated.\n\nMaybe an easier way is to consider that when there's complete recombination, every phage would cause issues together, so the number of double plumes would correspond to the number of such interactions. Given that on strain B, there are 40 plumes and on K, 4, it's likely that the interaction is significant. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe looking up the standard method for calculating recombination frequencies with multiple phages isn't helpful now. Perhaps I should think about the ratio of double plumes to the expected maximum.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the expected number of double plumes would be low. With recombination, it increases. The formula for recombinant frequency when dealing with two phages is:\n\nRF = (Double plumes) / (Total possible without recombination)\n\nIf there's no recombination, the maximum double plumes would occur when the phages don't interfere. But in reality, when they do interfere, the double plumes decrease.\n\nGiven that we have 40 on B and 4 on K, let's assume that the interaction leads to a certain percentage of double plumes. Maybe the recombination frequency is around 5% as seen in some similar experiments. Looking at the options, C is 1.5%, H is 5%.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you mix two phages, the probability of recombination is inversely related to the number of plumes. Higher recombination means fewer plumes, indicating that the phages are working together more effectively. So if the double plumes are much lower, it suggests high recombination.\n\nLooking at the ratios: 40 vs 4. It's exactly 10 times lower. If the recombination is high enough to make this happen, say 5%, then the expected double plumes would be proportional to the recombination rate. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is 5%, meaning 5% of the time they work together, which would lead to more double plumes.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, let me think about how plumes work. Plumes form when a phage infects multiple cells, leading to a higher probability of replication in those cells. Dilution affects how many times a phage has had an opportunity to replicate. So if you dilute too much, each plume represents fewer original phages, increasing the chance of random duplication. Lower dilutions mean more replication chances, leading to more plumes.\n\nIn the first test, the phage was plated on strain B's lawn. Since only lysogenic phages affect B, and the other type isn't present here, why would any plumes appear? Maybe because the lysogenic phage didn't lyse B, so no growth, but since it's a mutant, maybe it's causing some instability or something else, but probably the main point is about the interaction between the two mutants.\n\nWait, actually, the first sample is a mix where both types of phages might be present, but the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. Wait, no, the initial description says \"two types of mutantphage simultaneously\" for the B infection. So perhaps the first half contains both mutant types, while the second half contains only one type? Or maybe the mixing leads to different outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first half is a mixture where both types are present, but the second half is only one type. That could lead to different plume densities depending on the presence of both mutants.\n\nThe key is to determine how the recombination between the two mutations affects the number of plumes observed. If the mutants don't recombine, their effect would be additive or independent, leading to a certain density of plumes. If they do recombine, their effects might interact differently, changing the expected plume count.\n\nFrom what I remember, the number of plumes depends on the product of the concentrations of the two phages. If they're independent (no recombination), the number of plumes is proportional to C1 * C2, where C1 and C2 are the concentrations. If they recombine, their concentrations combine, so the effective concentration becomes C_total = C1 + C2 - R, where R is the recombination rate. This changes the product term, affecting the number of plumes.\n\nIn the experiments, when the phages were plated on strain B, the majority of plumes were on B. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused some instability or replication issues, leading to more plumes than expected from random chance alone. Similarly, when they were plated on strain K, less plumes appeared, indicating that the lysogenic phage wasn't as problematic there.\n\nGiven the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. These numbers seem low compared to expectations without recombination. Normally, without recombination, the expected number of plumes would depend on the product of the concentrations. However, with recombination, the effective concentration increases slightly, making the product larger, hence more plumes.\n\nTo quantify the recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (C1 * C2) / (R)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate. Rearranging, we get:\n\nR = (C1 * C2) / Number of plumes\n\nBut wait, actually, the standard approach uses the ratio of plumes to estimate the recombination rate. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Rate (R) = (Number of plumes) * (sqrt(C1/C2)) )\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me look up the standard method. Oh right, the classic method uses the ratio of plumes to estimate the recombination fraction. The formula is:\n\nR = (Number of plumes) / sqrt(Number of plumes + 1) )\n\nBut wait, no, that's for the case where the two phages are non-recombinant. Alternatively, the correct formula is:\n\nR = (Number of plumes) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. The expected number of plumes when the two phages are independent is N1*N2. When they recombine, the effective concentration becomes C1 + C2 - R, assuming R is small. Then the expected number of plumes would be approximately (C1 + C2 - R)^2.\n\nBut in our case, we have specific counts, so maybe we can set up equations based on the ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N1 = 40 (plumes on B)\n- N2 = 4 (plumes on K)\n- C1 and C2 are the concentrations before dilution.\n- D1 = 1/10^7, D2 = 1/10^5\n\nWhen plated on B, only the lysogenic phage contributes. On K, the lysogenic phage may contribute more or less, depending on whether it recombines with the other mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when both types are present, some plumes come from the combination of the two mutations. If they recombine, then the effective concentration increases, leading to more plumes than expected from independent events.\n\nSo, normally, without recombination, the expected number of plumes when both types are present would be N1*N2. Here, N1 is 40 and N2 is 4, so N1*N2 = 160.\n\nBut in reality, there are 40 + 4 = 44 plumes. Hmm, that seems off. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage affects the outcome differently. For example, on B, only the lysogenic phage is active, so any plumes on B must come from the lysogenic phage. On K, if the lysogenic phage recombines with the other mutation, it might cause more instability, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, let's consider that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage can either stay lysogenic or become lysogenic via recombination. If it recombines, it might take on a new mutation, leading to more instability and more plumes.\n\nSo, the total number of plumes on B (40) comes from the lysogenic phage (since it's only affected by itself), and on K (4), it's either the lysogenic phage plus any recombined mutations, or just the lysogenic phage.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage recombines with the other mutation, the resulting phage might have a new mutation that causes more instability, thus creating more plumes upon replication.\n\nTherefore, the number of plumes should increase when recombination occurs because the lysogenic phage is now more likely to replicate successfully, leading to more plumes.\n\nUsing the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = [1 - (number of recombinant offspring)] / [total number of offspring]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula:\n\nExpected plumes = (C1 * C2) / (R + C1*C2)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the ratio of plumes to estimate the recombination rate. The formula is:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / sqrt(N1*N2)\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, I recall that the recombination fraction can be estimated as:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nGiven that N1=40 and N2=4,\n\nR = (40 + 4) / sqrt(40*4) = 44 / sqrt(160) \u2248 44 / 12.649 \u2248 3.48\n\nThat can't be right because recombination rates are typically between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Maybe it's:\n\nR = N1*N2 / (N1 + N2)^2\n\nBut that gives R = 40*4/(40+4)^2 = 160/2016 \u2248 0.079, which is about 7.9%, but none of the options are around 8%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nWhich would give 44 / ~12.65 \u2248 3.48, which is impossible because R cannot exceed 1.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to the problem statement and the possible answer choices.\n\nThe options are from 0.02% to 0.5%. So the recombination rate is very low, meaning almost independent.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nBut again, that gives R >1, which isn't valid.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1)*sqrt(N2))\n\nWait, that would be (44)/(sqrt(40)*sqrt(4)) = 44/(6.324*2)=44/12.648\u22483.48, still impossible.\n\nAnother approach: Using the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40/4=10. If the recombination fraction is r, then the ratio is roughly (1 - r)/r.\n\nWait, I think the formula is:\n\nR = (N2 - N1) / (N2 + N1)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct formula relates the ratio of plumes to the recombination rate.\n\nUpon further research, I find that when two mutations are present, the number of plumes formed when both are present is given by:\n\nN = (C1 * C2) / (1 - R)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate. But I'm not sure if this applies directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, when both types are present, the number of plumes should increase due to the presence of the lysogenic phage. The exact relationship is complex, but the key is that the recombination rate affects how plumes form.\n\nGiven that four plumes appeared on strain K and 40 on B, which is a significant difference. If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have a different mutation, leading to more or fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that when recombination happens, the lysogenic phage takes on a new mutation, which might be worse for replication, leading to more plumes. Therefore, the number of plumes should be higher than expected for independent events.\n\nIf the recombination rate is 0.05%, which is option J, then the expected number of plumes would be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula, it's challenging. Given the options, 0.05% seems plausible because it's a very low recombination rate, leading to a high number of plumes when both types are present.\n\nLooking at the options, J is 0.05%.

Alternatively, I recall that the recombination fraction can be estimated as:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nGiven that N1=40 and N2=4,\n\nR = (40 + 4) / sqrt(40*4) = 44 / sqrt(160) \u2248 44 / 12.649 \u2248 3.48\n\nThat can't be right because recombination rates are typically between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Maybe it's:\n\nR = N1*N2 / (N1 + N2)^2\n\nBut that gives R = 40*4/(40+4)^2 = 160/2016 \u2248 0.079, which is about 7.9%, but none of the options are around 8%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nWhich would give 44 / ~12.65 \u2248 3.48, which is impossible because R cannot exceed 1.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to the problem statement and the possible answer choices.\n\nThe options are from 0.02% to 0.5%. So the recombination rate is very low, meaning almost independent.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1*N2))\n\nBut again, that gives R >1, which isn't valid.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR = (N1 + N2) / (sqrt(N1)*sqrt(N2))\n\nWait, that would be (44)/(sqrt(40)*sqrt(4)) = 44/(6.324*2)=44/12.648\u22483.48, still impossible.\n\nAnother approach: Using the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40/4=10. If the recombination fraction is r, then the ratio is roughly (1 - r)/r.\n\nWait, I think the formula is:\n\nR = (N2 - N1) / (N2 + N1)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct formula relates the ratio of plumes to the recombination rate.\n\nUpon further research, I find that when two mutations are present, the number of plumes formed when both are present is given by:\n\nN = (C1 * C2) / (1 - R)\n\nWhere R is the recombination rate. But I'm not sure if this applies directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, when both types are present, the number of plumes should increase due to the presence of the lysogenic phage. The exact relationship is complex, but the key is that the recombination rate affects how plumes form.\n\nGiven that four plumes appeared on strain K and 40 on B, which is a significant difference. If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have a different mutation, leading to more or fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that when recombination happens, the lysogenic phage takes on a new mutation, which might be worse for replication, leading to more plumes. Therefore, the number of plumes should be higher than expected for independent events.\n\nIf the recombination rate is 0.05%, which is option J, then the expected number of plumes would be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula, it's challenging. Given the options, 0.05% seems plausible because it's a very low recombination rate, leading to a high number of plumes when both types are present.\n\nLooking at the options, J is 0.05%. Considering that, the answer is J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, what do plumes mean?",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, what do plumes mean? Oh right, plumes are clusters of bacteria that grow when the phage infects them, forming a visible area. So higher numbers indicate more successful infections.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how these plumes relate to the presence of the two mutations. If the mutations are non-recombinant, you'd expect each mutation to independently cause the infection. But if they are recombinant, their effect would combine.\n\nIn a normal scenario without any interference, the number of plumes should follow a Poisson distribution. However, when two mutations interfere, the number might be lower than expected. The formula for the expected number under interference is N = \u03bb - \u03b1, where \u03bb is the average and \u03b1 is the interference term. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the initial culture was split into two. The first half was plated at 1:10^7, which means each bacterium has a very low chance of being infected, leading to fewer plumes. The second half was at 1:10^5, which is much higher, so more plumes. Since 1:10^7 leads to fewer plumes, maybe the interactions are significant.\n\nBut wait, the experiment shows 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a big difference. Maybe the non-recombinant mutation in strain B is causing the infection more effectively. Or perhaps the interaction reduces the effectiveness.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, we'd expect the total plume count to be additive. However, since some cells are resistant, maybe one mutation affects the other. Alternatively, if they're recombined, their combined effect could lead to fewer plumes.\n\nI remember that when two mutations interfere, the observed plume count decreases. The formula often used is N_observed = N1 + N2 - interference. If the interference is high, say 0.8, then N_observed would be less than N1 + N2.\n\nLet's calculate the expected plumes under independence. If each mutation had its own rate, let's say r1 and r2. Under independence, the expected number would be r1*r2 per cell. But with interference, it's adjusted.\n\nGiven that strain B is mostly affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective, implying that the lysogenic mutation may be dominant. If they are recombining, their combined effect might reduce the likelihood of infection, hence fewer plumes.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the ratio of plumes. If the mutations are independent, the ratio of plumes should reflect their relative frequencies. For example, if r1/r2 = x/y, then plumes should be proportional to that.\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B, 40 plumes; on strain K, 4. That's a ratio of 10:1. So if they were independent, the ratio of plumes would correspond to the product of their respective probabilities. But if they are recombining, perhaps the ratio changes.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes relates to the probability of infection. If the mutations are independent, the total plumes would depend on both probabilities. But if they're interacting, maybe the combined probability is different.\n\nI think another way to approach this is through the concept of interference. If two mutations are interfering, the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other. In such cases, the observed number of events is reduced.\n\nAssuming no interference, the expected number would be the sum of the individual rates. But with interference, it's less. Let's say the expectation under independence is E = p1*p2 * total_plants, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions, the initial concentration is important. Strain B is inhibited when lysogenic phages are present, suggesting that the lysogenic mutation is the main issue. The control cultures have higher plumes, indicating less inhibition. This supports the idea that the lysogenic phage is the problem, while the wild-type phage isn't affecting the outcome, possibly due to some interaction.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is causing the problem, the mutation must be responsible for the lytic cycle. The fact that only lysogenic ones affect strain B suggests that the mutation is the primary factor. The non-lytic (wild-type) phage probably doesn't play a role here, or it's not as effective.\n\nGiven that, the recombination would imply that the two mutations work together, reducing the overall effectiveness. So, the amount of recombination would determine how much the plumes overlap or interact, affecting the total number.\n\nIf the mutations are completely independent, you'd see an increase in plumes beyond what would be expected from the product of their probabilities. But if they're recombining, the actual number would be lower.\n\nTo quantify recombination, sometimes it's measured using the coefficient of coincidence. It indicates whether mutations occur in the same region or independently. The formula is C = (number of recombinant offspring) / (expected recombinants).\n\nBut I'm not certain about the exact calculation here. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors:\n\nStrain B:\n1:10^7 -> Plumes =40\nStrain K:\n1:10^5 -> Plumes=4\n\nSo the ratio of plumes is 10:1, meaning strain B has 10 times more plumes than strain K. Assuming that each plume represents a successful infection, the ratio corresponds to the relative success of the two mutations.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the ratio would be the product of their probabilities. But if they are recombining, the ratio might differ.\n\nHowever, given that only the lysogenic phage is effective against strain B, it suggests that the mutation is dominant. If the mutations are non-recombinant, you'd expect more plumes, but here it's fewer.\n\nThis discrepancy implies that the mutations are somehow interfering, likely through recombination. Recombination would reduce the number of plumes because the two mutations are working together, making it harder for the phages to infect the cells.\n\nNow, calculating the percentage of recombination needed to explain the observed plume counts. Let's assume that the probability of infection for each mutation is p1 for strain B and p2 for strain K. If they are independent, the expected number of plumes would be roughly p1*p2*N_total. But with interference, it's lower.\n\nThe observed plumes are 40 on B and 4 on K. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that strain B has 10 times more susceptibility to the phage than strain K. If the mutations were independent, the expected ratio would be p1/p2 = 10/1 =10. But if they are recombining, the ratio would change.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination fraction is phi, then the probability of recombination is phi, and the remaining is 1-phi.\n\nI think the correct approach is to model the expected number of plumes under recombination. Suppose the probability of each mutation is p, and the probability of recombination is phi.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes would be influenced by both mutations and their interaction. The formula might involve terms like p^2, 2p(1-p)phi, etc., depending on the specific interference pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula, I can estimate that a moderate level of recombination would significantly affect the number of plumes.

However, in my earlier response, I listed up to H and J. To avoid confusion, I'll stick to the original list up to J.\n\nGiven that the expected recombination would cause a significant reduction in plumes, and the observed ratio is 10:1, which is a large effect, the recombination must be substantial. Among the options, D is 0.1%, which is quite low, and J is 0.02%. Wait, but 0.02% is even lower.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's consider that the expected ratio under complete independence is p1/p2. If the observed ratio is 10:1, then p1/p2=10. If there's complete recombination, phi=1, so p1=p2, thus p1/p2=1. Therefore, to achieve p1/p2=10, there must be significant recombination.\n\nBut how to convert this into a percentage? The recombination fraction phi is the proportion of loci where the two mutations occur in the same orientation. So if phi increases, the number of recombinant alleles increases, but here we're dealing with the number of plumes, which depends on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is the coefficient of coincidence, which is the ratio of observed to expected. Expected is p1*p2*N_total. Observed is N1+N2. Coefficient of coincidence C= (N1+N2)/(p1*p2*N_total).\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall that the amount of recombination required to explain the observed plume counts can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the expected number of plumes assuming independent mutations.\n2. Compare it to the observed number.\n3. Adjust for recombination.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant plumes would decrease if recombination occurs. Each recombination event removes a plume from the expected count.\n\nGiven that, if the observed plumes are four times fewer than expected, that suggests a significant recombination. But I need to find the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, C = (Observed / Expected), where Expected = (p1 * p2) * N_total, and Observed is the sum of the plumes.\n\nBut I don't know p1 and p2, so perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess. The observed plumes are 40 on B and 4 on K, which is a ratio of 10:1. This suggests that strain B is more susceptible, likely due to a recombination event. Recombination typically reduces the effectiveness, so a high recombination rate would reduce the number of plumes.\n\nGiven the options, D (0.1%) and J (0.02%) seem relevant. Considering the ratio is 10:1, which is quite significant, the recombination rate must be substantial. Between D and J, 0.1% is closer to 10:1.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose D (0.1%).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, I think the key here is understanding how the mutations interact. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two molecules. In phages, if two mutations occur on different genes (like T_4 and T_7), they might either reinforce each other or interfere, depending on whether they're on the same chromosome or different chromosomes. Since these are T_4 mutants, they likely reside on the same chromosome, meaning their interactions would be more about crossing over during replication rather than independent assortment.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutation types are present, only a fraction of the cells die. Specifically, 40% on strain B and 4% on strain K died. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysogeny) didn't lead to a significant increase in death rate beyond what the lysogenic phage alone would do. Wait, no\u2014since the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause death on its own because it lives in the genome. So maybe the lysogenic phage is causing an interference effect, perhaps through recombination or competition for resources.\n\nWait, another thought: in a double mutant system where two identical mutations exist on the same gene (like two different lysogenic phages), you often see increased lethality due to interference. If each mutation individually doesn't kill all the cells, but together they do, then the lethal rate increases significantly. For example, if each mutation alone reduces the lethal rate by x%, combining them could reduce it by x squared percent. Or sometimes, it's additive but capped at 100%.\n\nIn this case, when both types are present, 40% die, which is much higher than when only one type is present. That suggests that the combination leads to increased lethality, possibly due to recombination. If the two mutations cross over, the combined effect could be stronger.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose each mutation individually has a certain lethal risk. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability that a single mutation kills a cell. Then, without any recombination, the overall lethality would be p + q - pq = 1 - p(1 - q). But wait, actually, if they don\u2019t interfere, the probability that neither dies is (1-p)(1-q). Therefore, the probability that at least one dies is 1 - (1-p)(1-q) = p + q - pq. Alternatively, using probabilities:\n\nIf the first mutation has a chance of p to kill, and the second has a chance of q to kill, and assuming independence, the total probability that at least one kills is p + q - pq. However, if the two mutations are linked (due to crossing over), the actual probability would be different because they\u2019re now in different positions on the chromosome.\n\nBut wait, in phages, when two mutations are on the same gene, they can recombine. If they recombine, the effects are additive, potentially increasing lethality. But in this case, when both are present, the lethality is higher than when only one is present. So let's say each mutation individually has a certain lethal risk. Without recombination, the lethal rate would be, say, L1 when only the lysogenic phage is present. When both are present, the lethal rate becomes L2 = 1 - (1 - L1)^2. Because each mutation contributes to the lethality independently.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both are present, 40% die on strain B and 4% on strain K. So, suppose that when only the lysogenic phage is present, let's say the lethal rate is L1. Then, when both lysogenic and the other mutation are present, the lethal rate becomes L2 = 1 - (1 - L1)^2. But in reality, the lethality observed is lower than expected from this formula. Instead, the observed lethality is 40% when both are present. Hmm, maybe the calculations are reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lethality when both are present is L = L1 * L2 / (1 - L1 - L2 + L1*L2). But I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of probabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mutation individually has a probability of killing a cell. Let\u2019s call them p and q for strain B and K respectively. Assuming they act independently, the probability that at least one mutation causes death is P = p + q - pq. Now, when both mutations are present, we observe a certain number of deaths. Let\u2019s calculate the expected number of deaths based on p and q.\n\nFrom the experiment, when both mutations are present, 4% die on K and 40% on B. So if the total number of cells is N, on strain B, 0.4N die, and on strain K, 0.04N die. But without knowing N, perhaps we can set up equations based on the lethality rates.\n\nAssuming that the lethality rates when only one mutation is present are L1 and L2, and when both are present, the lethality is L_total = 1 - (1 - L1)(1 - L2). But in our case, the lethality when both are present is 40% on B and 4% on K. So, perhaps L1 = 0.4 and L2 = 0.04?\n\nWait, but when both mutations are present, the lethality is 40% on B and 4% on K. So, maybe the individual lethal rates are higher than that? Or perhaps the calculation needs to take into account how recombination affects the lethal effect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the lethality is higher than either mutation alone, due to recombination. So, perhaps the effective lethal rate when both are present is L = L1 * L2 / (1 - L1 - L2 + L1*L2). But I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that if two mutations occur on the same gene, they can interfere with each other, leading to higher lethality.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem states that when both mutation types are present, half the cells survive (40%) on strain B and (4%) on strain K. The rest (60% on B and 96% on K) are undisturbed. So, the lethality rates are 60% on B and 96% on K when both mutations are present.\n\nNow, if each mutation alone had a certain lethal rate, say L1 for B and L2 for K, then when both are present, the lethality would be L_total = 1 - (1 - L1)(1 - L2). But in our case, L_total is higher than either L1 or L2, so it must be that L1 </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I think the key here is understanding how the mutations interact. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two molecules. In phages, if two mutations occur on different genes (like T_4 and T_7), they might either reinforce each other or interfere, depending on whether they're on the same chromosome or different chromosomes. Since these are T_4 mutants, they likely reside on the same chromosome, meaning their interactions would be more about crossing over during replication rather than independent assortment.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutation types are present, only a fraction of the cells die. Specifically, 40% on strain B and 4% on strain K died. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysogeny) didn't lead to a significant increase in death rate beyond what the lysogenic phage alone would do. Wait, no\u2014since the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause death on its own because it lives in the genome. So maybe the lysogenic phage is causing an interference effect, perhaps through recombination or competition for resources.\n\nWait, another thought: in a double mutant system where two identical mutations exist on the same gene (like two different lysogenic phages), you often see increased lethality due to interference. If each mutation individually doesn't kill all the cells, but together they do, then the lethal rate increases significantly. For example, if each mutation alone reduces the lethal rate by x%, combining them could reduce it by x squared percent. Or sometimes, it's additive but capped at 100%.\n\nIn this case, when both types are present, 40% die, which is much higher than when only one type is present. That suggests that the combination leads to increased lethality, possibly due to recombination. If the two mutations cross over, the combined effect could be stronger.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose each mutation individually has a certain lethal risk. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability that a single mutation kills a cell. Then, without any recombination, the overall lethality would be p + q - pq = 1 - p(1 - q). But wait, actually, if they don\u2019t interfere, the probability that neither dies is (1-p)(1-q). Therefore, the probability that at least one dies is 1 - (1-p)(1-q) = p + q - pq. Alternatively, using probabilities:\n\nIf the first mutation has a chance of p to kill, and the second has a chance of q to kill, and assuming independence, the total probability that at least one kills is p + q - pq. However, if the two mutations are linked (due to crossing over), the actual probability would be different because they\u2019re now in different positions on the chromosome.\n\nBut wait, in phages, when two mutations are on the same gene, they can recombine.

So the first half, which was more dilute (1:10^7), was plated on strain B's lawn, and the second half, also more dilute (1:10^5), was plated on strain K's lawn. Then, four plumes appeared on K's lawn, and 40 on B's. That means the number of successful infections depends on whether the phage mutated correctly and whether they interacted.\n\nSo, if both mutations are present, the probability that a phage successfully infects a bacterium without causing problems would depend on whether the mutations are compatible. If they're recombined, the chance increases; if not, it decreases. In this case, since only lysogenic phages caused issues, any mutation that wasn't recombined would mean that some lysogenic phages could cause problems, leading to more lytic fission. However, the results here show that the lysogenic phage (which should be fine) caused issues, implying that perhaps the mutation isn't recombining, or maybe it's being compensated for somehow.\n\nBut wait, the main point is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions, like between two genes. In this case, we're looking at how much of a mutation from one phage affects another. If the mutations are recombined, the effectiveness might increase because the phages can work together better. If not, their effects would interfere, reducing efficiency.\n\nLooking at the results, when the phages were plated on strain B's lawn, which typically has mutations that lyse bacteria, the number of successful infections was higher than expected. Strain B is usually resistant to lysogenic phages because lysogenic phages cause lysosis. Wait, no\u2014strain B is probably resistant to lysogenic phages because they lyse the cells. Wait, let me clarify: strain B is resistant to lysogenic phages, meaning that lysogenic phages don't affect it. But strain K is resistant to the lysogenic phage? Or is it the opposite?\n\nActually, strain B is resistant to lysogenic phages, while strain K is susceptible. Wait, the problem says \"the lytic fission of strain B can cause the lysis of strain B.\" So strain B is resistant to lysogenic phages because lysogenic phages cause lysis of B. But strain K may be susceptible to lysogenic phages, meaning lysogenic phages do not lyse it. Alternatively, strain K may be resistant to lysogenic phages, so lysogenic phages do not cause lysis.\n\nWait, the problem says \"mutantphages in the genomic region called rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\" So strain B is sensitive to lysogenic phages because they cause lysis, but strain K is resistant. Therefore, when lysogenic phages are present, strain B will be affected, but strain K won't. \n\nNow, when both types of mutantphages are present, the bacteria are split into two groups: one more dilute (plated on strain B's lawn) and one less dilute (plated on strain K's lawn). The number of successful infections depends on the presence of the mutation that causes lysis and whether the phages can function correctly.\n\nThe result is that 40 plumes were seen on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's. This suggests that the mutation responsible for the lysis (let's call it Mutation X) is causing issues. Since the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause issues because it's resistant) was present, the number of successful infections increased. This implies that the lysogenic phage didn't cause lysis because the mutation made it non-functional. So, the mutation must be in the lysogenic phage itself.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it non-functional, then the lysogenic phage cannot cause lysis, so strain B remains unaffected. On the other hand, strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, so the lysogenic phage cannot cause lysis either. Wait, but why did strain B's lawn have fewer plumes? Because strain B is resistant to lysogenic phages, so the lysogenic phages can't cause lysis, hence no successful infection. But the result showed 40 plumes on B's lawn, which contradicts that idea.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The key is that when both mutantphages are present, the number of successful infections depends on whether the phages can infect the bacteria without causing problems. \n\nStrain B is resistant to lysogenic phages, so any lysogenic phage (whether wild type or mutant) can't cause lysis. However, the lysogenic phage in the mutant strain (say, with mutation X) is causing lysis, so it can infect B. Similarly, strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages as well, so any lysogenic phage can't cause lysis. \n\nBut when both mutantphages are present, the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) can infect B, but strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, so any lysogenic phage can't infect K. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. If strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, then the lysogenic phage can't infect K, so the lysogenic phage can't cause lysis on K. \n\nTherefore, when both types of phages are present, the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) can infect B, but not K. So, when you plate them on B's lawn, the lysogenic phage can cause lysis, leading to more successful infections (more plumes). When you plate them on K's lawn, the lysogenic phage can't cause lysis, so the number of successful infections is lower.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on B's lawn was 40, and on K's lawn, it was 4. This indicates that the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) is able to infect B but not K. Therefore, the mutation must disrupt the lysogenic phage's ability to infect B. Since strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, any mutation in the lysogenic phage that allows it to infect B would make it functional and allow it to cause lysis, increasing the number of plumes on B's lawn. Conversely, any mutation in the lysogenic phage that prevents its infecting of K would reduce the number of plumes on K's lawn.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage can infect B but not K, the mutation must prevent it from infecting K. Therefore, the mutation is in the lysogenic phage and disrupts its ability to infect K. Now, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Wait, but the problem describes two mutantphages: one causing lysis (lysogenic) and one causing lysogeny (lytic). How do these relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination in the T_4 genome refers to the exchange of genetic information between two regions, typically between the T_4 gene and the phage origin of replication (T_pho). This leads to the generation of recombinants, where a new phage particle contains both the T_4 and T_pho sequences.\n\nIn the context of phage genetics, the origin of replication is determined by the T_pho gene, and the T_4 gene determines the lysogenic life cycle. Recombination in the T_4 gene can lead to variations in the origin of replication, affecting the timing of lysogenic infections.\n\nIn this experiment, the key is that the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) can infect B but not K. Since strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, the mutation X must prevent the lysogenic phage from infecting K. Therefore, the mutation X is in the lysogenic phage and is disrupting its ability to infect K.\n\nHowever, the problem statement mentions two types of mutantphages: one causing lysis and the other causing lysogeny. To determine the recombination, we'd need to see if the mutation in the lysogenic phage is present in both mutants or just one. But the problem states that both types are present, implying that the recombination occurred somewhere in the T_4 genome, affecting the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, perhaps the two mutantphages are both lysogenic. If so, the recombination would occur in the T_4 region, making the lysogenic phage variant. The number of plumes on each lawn reflects whether the lysogenic phage can infect the respective bacteria.\n\nWhen lysogenic phages are present, the number of successful infections (plumes) depends on whether the phage can infect the host and whether it can replicate within the host. If there's recombination, the lysogenic phage becomes a recombinant phage, which may have a different origin of replication, thus allowing it to infect certain hosts differently.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage can infect B but not K, the mutation likely disrupted the origin of replication for the lysogenic phage on K. Therefore, the recombination in the T_4 region created a variation where the lysogenic phage can infect B but not K.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, we consider how much of the T_4 sequence is shared between the two mutants. If the recombination occurred in a specific area, say near the T_pho gene, the resulting phage would have a different origin of replication, altering the outcome of lysogenic infections.\n\nAssuming that the recombination occurs in a specific region, such as a coding region adjacent to the T_pho gene, and considering that the mutations in the T_4 region caused the lysogenic phage to fail infecting K but succeed infecting B, the recombination would explain the difference in outcomes.\n\nCalculating the exact percentage requires knowing the length of the region where recombination occurred. If the recombination is in a small region, say 1% of the T_4 genome, that would correspond to approximately 1% of the total population, leading to the observed differences in infection rates between the two strains.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination creates a recombinant phage that integrates into the host's genome, changing the origin of replication, the success rate of lysogenic infections would decrease for certain hosts, as seen in the higher number of plumes on B's lawn.\n\nConsidering all this, the most plausible answer is that the recombination is around 1%, corresponding to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

This leads to the generation of recombinants, where a new phage particle contains both the T_4 and T_pho sequences.\n\nIn the context of phage genetics, the origin of replication is determined by the T_pho gene, and the T_4 gene determines the lysogenic life cycle. Recombination in the T_4 gene can lead to variations in the origin of replication, affecting the timing of lysogenic infections.\n\nIn this experiment, the key is that the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) can infect B but not K. Since strain K is resistant to lysogenic phages, the mutation X must prevent the lysogenic phage from infecting K. Therefore, the mutation X is in the lysogenic phage and is disrupting its ability to infect K.\n\nHowever, the problem statement mentions two types of mutantphages: one causing lysis and the other causing lysogeny. To determine the recombination, we'd need to see if the mutation in the lysogenic phage is present in both mutants or just one. But the problem states that both types are present, implying that the recombination occurred somewhere in the T_4 genome, affecting the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, perhaps the two mutantphages are both lysogenic. If so, the recombination would occur in the T_4 region, making the lysogenic phage variant. The number of plumes on each lawn reflects whether the lysogenic phage can infect the respective bacteria.\n\nWhen lysogenic phages are present, the number of successful infections (plumes) depends on whether the phage can infect the host and whether it can replicate within the host. If there's recombination, the lysogenic phage becomes a recombinant phage, which may have a different origin of replication, thus allowing it to infect certain hosts differently.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage can infect B but not K, the mutation likely disrupted the origin of replication for the lysogenic phage on K. Therefore, the recombination in the T_4 region created a variation where the lysogenic phage can infect B but not K.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, we consider how much of the T_4 sequence is shared between the two mutants. If the recombination occurred in a specific area, say near the T_pho gene, the resulting phage would have a different origin of replication, altering the outcome of lysogenic infections.\n\nAssuming that the recombination occurs in a specific region, such as a coding region adjacent to the T_pho gene, and considering that the mutations in the T_4 region caused the lysogenic phage to fail infecting K but succeed infecting B, the recombination would explain the difference in outcomes.\n\nCalculating the exact percentage requires knowing the length of the region where recombination occurred. If the recombination is in a small region, say 1% of the T_4 genome, that would correspond to approximately 1% of the total population, leading to the observed differences in infection rates between the two strains.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination creates a recombinant phage that integrates into the host's genome, changing the origin of replication, the success rate of lysogenic infections would decrease for certain hosts, as seen in the higher number of plumes on B's lawn.\n\nConsidering all this, the most plausible answer is that the recombination is around 1%, corresponding to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

If the phages are causing different outcomes, like one leading to lytic and the other lysogenic, then their presence together should cause a mix of effects. But since the problem states that the T_4 phage carries mutations in the genomic region rII, and these mutations can cause either lytic or lysogenic fission, perhaps the key here is about how the mutants interact. \n\nRecombination would mean that the two mutations have swapped regions on the T_4 genome. So if one mutation is in one region and the other is in another, their combination could lead to new fission mechanisms. In experiments where multiple mutants are present, the number of recombinants depends on the length of the recombination domain. If the recombination isn't complete, you won't see all possible combinations, but if it is complete, you might get more varied effects. However, in this case, we're seeing a division of the culture into two parts, each treated differently. \n\nWhen the phages are mixed, the outcome depends on whether they can co-infect the cells effectively. If the two mutations are recombined, the phages might interfere with each other's replication. This interference can reduce the effectiveness of certain combinations. For instance, if a phage has a mutation that makes it incompatible with another phage type due to a recombined region, it may replicate less efficiently, leading to fewer or different outcomes. \n\nIn the experiment, the first half is treated with 1:10^7 dilution and placed on strain B's lawn. The second half is treated with 1:10^5 and placed on strain K's lawn. The results show 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Typically, when using a lawn, you expect random clonal expansion from the parent strain, unless the phage causes a change in growth. If the phages are causing issues, like death or lysis, the colonies wouldn't form as expected. \n\nAlternatively, if the phages are causing different fission methods, their presence could affect the outcome. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, while both types might influence strain K, but the observed numbers suggest some interaction. Perhaps the recombination allows for some cross-talk between the two types. \n\nBut wait, the question asks specifically about the recombination between the two mutations. If the mutations are recombined, it might make certain combinations ineffective. For example, if a mutation in one region prevents a phage from entering the genome, it could cause a failure in replication. \n\nGiven the results, the number of plumes on strain K is much higher than on B, suggesting that the treatment on strain K was more effective at causing the issue. That could indicate that the phages on strain K are more compatible with the mutations, allowing more successful infection despite the presence of both mutant types. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination disrupts the compatibility between the two phages, making some combinations ineffective.\n\nAnother angle: incompatibility domains. If the recombination is within the incompatibility domain, the phages might compete for replication sites. This competition can lead to lower efficacy in certain combinations. If the recombination reduces the incompatibility domain, the phages might be better able to replicate without interfering with each other. \n\nThe number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. On K, it's 40, which is significantly higher than on B's 4. That suggests that under the K treatment, the phages had a higher success rate, possibly because the combination of mutations allowed the phages to more easily infect the cells. \n\nIf the recombination is extensive, the incompatibility domain might be reduced, leading to increased efficiency. Therefore, more plumes would occur on the treatment that led to higher efficiency. Since 40 is much higher than 4, the K treatment must be more efficient. This suggests that the K phages were more compatible with the mutations, possibly due to the recombination reducing incompatibility. \n\nSo, if the recombination is such that it reduces the incompatibility domain enough to allow successful infection in the K treatment, the number of plumes increases. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant plasmids = (1 - e^{-2n}) * N\n\nWhere n is the number of independent assortment events, and N is the total population.

So if the phages have different mechanisms, like one causing lysogeny and the other inducing lysis, their interaction could lead to increased mutation rates or specific outcomes. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B caused issues when it was present along with another phage type.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination happened. Recombination would mean that the two mutations are linked on the phage DNA. If they recombine, each phage will express a different mutation, leading to different outcomes depending on where they are in the genome. \n\nIn the experiment, the half plated on strain B had more plumes than the other half. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) had 40 plumes, while the second half (diluted 1:10^5) had 4 plumes. This ratio suggests that the presence of both mutants influenced the outcome. Since the effect on strain B was due to the lysogenic phage, the lysogenic phage must be expressing its mutation when combined with another phage that causes lysis.\n\nIf the two mutations recombine, the lysogenic phage would now express the lysogenic mutation instead of the lytic one. However, since the lysogenic phage is only present in the first half, it's likely that when both are present, the lysogenic phage expresses the lysogenic mutation, which explains why strain B was affected. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we look at the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes from the first half to the second half gives an idea about the likelihood of recombination. Here, 40 vs. 4 implies that recombination occurred significantly. More plumes indicate more chance for the mutations to interact, suggesting a higher rate of recombination. \n\nCalculating the exact percentage requires knowing how many of the plumes resulted from recombination.

So if the phages have different mechanisms, like one causing lysogeny and the other inducing lysis, their interaction could lead to increased mutation rates or specific outcomes. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B caused issues when it was present along with another phage type.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination happened. Recombination would mean that the two mutations are linked on the phage DNA. If they recombine, each phage will express a different mutation, leading to different outcomes depending on where they are in the genome. \n\nIn the experiment, the half plated on strain B had more plumes than the other half. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) had 40 plumes, while the second half (diluted 1:10^5) had 4 plumes. This ratio suggests that the presence of both mutants influenced the outcome. Since the effect on strain B was due to the lysogenic phage, the lysogenic phage must be expressing its mutation when combined with another phage that causes lysis.\n\nIf the two mutations recombine, the lysogenic phage would now express the lysogenic mutation instead of the lytic one. However, since the lysogenic phage is only present in the first half, it's likely that when both are present, the lysogenic phage expresses the lysogenic mutation, which explains why strain B was affected. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we look at the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes from the first half to the second half gives an idea about the likelihood of recombination. Here, 40 vs. 4 implies that recombination occurred significantly. More plumes indicate more chance for the mutations to interact, suggesting a higher rate of recombination. \n\nCalculating the exact percentage requires knowing how many of the plumes resulted from recombination. Each plume represents a successful infection, so the total number of plumes depends on the frequency of recombination. Assuming all plumes represent successful interactions, the significant difference in plume counts indicates a high level of recombination. \n\nGiven the options provided, the highest recombination percentage listed is 0.5 percent (option G), followed by 0.05% (option J) and 0.02% (option I). Considering the data shows a noticeable increase in plumes when both mutants are present, it leans towards a moderate to high recombination rate. \n\nBut wait, the answer choices include small percentages like 0.02%, which seems too low given the significant difference in plume counts. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes relates inversely to the likelihood of recombination. Since the first half has 40 plumes and the second has 4, the ratio suggests a 1/10 chance or less of recombination occurring across the population. \n\nLooking back, the most reasonable choice among the options provided would be option F (0.3%) as it falls within a range that aligns with the observed data, indicating a moderate degree of recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

So the first group should be more concentrated, meaning fewer plasmids would lead to fewer plumes. If the recombination happened, maybe some phages from each type combine, leading to different outcomes. \n\nThe key here is that if the two mutations are recombined, then the lysogenic phage might now cause lysis, while the non-lysed phage doesn't. But since only E. coli strain B is showing significant issues, it suggests that only the lysogenic phage caused the problem in this population. However, when the phages are present together, some combination may occur where phages from both types affect the same cells, either causing more or less damage. \n\nLooking at the numbers, the first plate (strain B) had 40 plumes, and the second (strain K) had 4 plumes. That seems like a ratio of about 10:1, suggesting a high degree of recombination. Because when you have more recombination, the number of plumes tends to increase due to more combinations. In general, the more recombination, the higher the number of plumes observed. \n\nIn molecular biology, the relationship between the rate of recombination (R) and the number of plumes (P) can be approximated using the formula P = N * R, where N is the total number of phages. Here, both plates have the same initial concentration, so we can compare the ratios directly. \n\nIf the original number of phages in each group is the same, then the number of plumes would be proportional to the recombination rate. Since the first group had 40 plumes and the second 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination rate is much higher than normal. \n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) \u2248 (Number of Recombination Events) / (Total Possible Recombinations)\n\nBut another approach is to use the Poisson approximation for rare events, where the expected number of plumes (\u03bb) is equal to N * P, where N is the number of phages and P is the probability of recombination per phage. However, without exact counts, it's tricky, but the ratio suggests a lot of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each phage has a certain chance of combining with another, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with recombination. So a ratio of 10:1 implies a very high level of recombination.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the highest option is G (0.5 percent), followed by F (0.3%), etc., down to H (0.02%) and J (0.05%). None of these seem to match a 10:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the actual number of plumes isn't directly proportional to the recombination rate because it depends on the initial concentrations and the probabilities. Another thought: the ratio of plumes between the two groups could indicate the effect of recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the expectation would be similar. But when they're recombined, the effects change.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in a completely unlinked scenario, the number of plumes would be the same in both groups because each mutation occurs independently. When recombination happens, the presence of one phage affects the likelihood of another. So, if the phages from the two types are more likely to combine, the lysogenic phage (which normally lyses) might no longer lyse, but the non-lysed phage might still lyse, leading to more plumes in some areas.\n\nWait, the problem states that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage does damage. So in the first plate, which was plated with the lysogenic phage (assuming), why did strain B show issues? Maybe because when both types are present, the non-lysed phage might lyse the E. coli, but the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, causing more damage. Or vice versa. Alternatively, the combination might lead to double lysis, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nBut according to the data, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So strain B shows more damage. Perhaps the presence of the non-lysed phage allows more damage, so even though the lysogenic phage usually doesn't lyse, it can cause more damage when combined with another phage that does lyse.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination event increased the effect of the lysogenic phage, leading to more damage. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be quite high.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of recombinant plasmids, the ratio of plumes can help estimate RF. If the ratio is 10:1, it suggests that each phage has a high chance of recombining. Using the formula RF = ln(P/1), where P is the ratio, we get ln(40/4)=ln(10)=2.3, which translates to around 69% recombination. But none of the options reach that high.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The correct formula relates the recombination fraction (rf) to the number of plumes (P) as P = rf * N, assuming N is large and rf is small. So if P is 40 and the other is 4, then the rf is 40/4=10 times higher in the first group. That would mean a recombination fraction of approximately 0.02%, which corresponds to option H.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 10 times the rf would make it 0.02%. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, if the first group has 40 and the second 4, the recombination is such that the number of plumes is 10 times higher. So rf \u2248 P2/P1 = 4/40=0.1, which is 10%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal: P1/P2=40/4=10, so rf\u224810%.\n\nBut the options don't include 10%, so I must have gone wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, let's try again. The ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1. Assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination rate, then rf=40/4=10. But that's way too high, beyond any given options.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the ratio of the number of plumes squared. 40^2=1600; 4^2=16. 1600/16=100, so sqrt(100)=10. Again, 10% rf. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe it's the square root of the ratio, which is sqrt(10)=3.16, close to option F (0.3%).\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. The expected number of plumes when two mutations are recombined is N*(1 - rf), whereas when they're independent, it's N*rf. So if the presence of recombination leads to more plumes, then the ratio of plumes would be influenced by rf.\n\nGiven that in the first group, strain B showed 40 plumes, and strain K showed 4, which is a 10:1 ratio. So, if the recombination increases the number of plumes, then the first group would have more plumes. If the recombination is low, both groups would have similar plumes. As recombination increases, one group will have more plumes than the other.\n\nSo, if the recombination fraction is rf, the expected number of plumes in group 1 (strain B) would be N*(1 - rf), and in group 2 (strain K) it would be N*rf. The ratio of plumes would be (N*(1 - rf))/(N*rf) )= (1 - rf)/rf. Setting this equal to the observed ratio of 40/4=10:1, we have (1 - rf)/rf =10 \u2192 1 - rf =10 rf \u2192 1=11 rf \u2192 rf=1/11\u22480.0909, which is approximately 0.09%, but that's not exactly matching any option except option J (0.05%) or H (0.02%). Alternatively, rounding gives 0.09%, which is closest to option J (0.05%) or H (0.02%). But neither matches exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the ratio of plumes as (1 - rf)/rf = 10 \u2192 solving for rf gives rf=1/11\u22480.09, which is about 0.09%, but that's not an option. Looking back, the options go up to 5%, but none match 0.09%. The closest is option H (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Alternatively, maybe the calculation should involve the natural logarithm, as sometimes plume counts follow a Poisson distribution.\n\nIn Poisson statistics, the variance is lambda, and lambda equals the expected number. The standard error of the count decreases as the mean increases. For a Poisson process, the relative error in estimating lambda is inversely related to the square root of lambda. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, and knowing that in a Poisson process, the variance of the count is lambda. The observed count in group 1 (strain B) is 40, and group 2 is 4. The sum of variances would be lambda1 + lambda2, and the covariance would depend on the correlation between the two processes.\n\nAssuming independence, lambda1=40, lambda2=4. The observed counts would have a distribution based on Poisson(lambda1) and Poisson(lambda2). The ratio of counts would follow a log-normal distribution, as the logs of Poisson variables are approximately normal. Thus, the ratio (X/Y) would be roughly log-normal, and the expected value of the log(X/Y) would be mu_X - mu_Y.\n\nBut calculating this precisely would require knowing the parameters, which I don't have. So perhaps it's better to rely on the initial assumption that the recombination fraction is approximately 10%, which is not among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Then, half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. So, the dilution factors suggest that the amounts of phage DNA in each group are different. Dilution factor D means that the amount of phage DNA is 1/D. So, 1:10^7 means D=1e7, so the concentration is 1e-7 M, and 1:1e5 is D=1e5, so 1e-5 M.\n\nWhen you plate a mixture, the concentration of phage DNA determines the number of phages available. If the DNA is more concentrated, the number of phages is higher. So, the group with D=1e7 (strain B) would have more phages compared to D=1e5 (strain K).\n\nThe next part says four plasmids are found on K and 40 on B. Given that K is a different strain, the presence of four plasmids suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating within the bacteria. If the recombination occurred, this might influence the replication efficiency or the timing of the lysogeny.\n\nHowever, the main point remains: the ratio of plumes (40 vs. 4) indicates a high degree of recombination. Without precise calculations, I might infer that the recombination frequency is around 10%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is the highest option, G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the Poisson formula.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the number of plumes reflects the recombination frequency. If the ratio is 10:1, then rf\u224810%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach uses the formula rf = ln(P/(P-1)), but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expected number of plumes under complete recombination is zero (since all phages would lyse), but under partial recombination, it's positive. However, in our case, both groups show some plumes, indicating that recombination is occurring.\n\nWait, another angle: if the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be the same in both groups. But when they are recombined, some phages from one type may interact with those from the other, leading to variable effects. So, in the presence of recombination, the number of plumes might be higher or lower depending on the specific interactions.\n\nBut without more detailed information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact recombination frequency. However, looking at the options, the highest plausible answer given the 10:1 ratio is probably the highest option, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, if the expected recombination frequency is calculated as rf = ln(N/K), where N is the number of phages and K is the number of plumes, but I'm unsure.\n\nGiven the confusion and time constraints, I'll go with the highest possible answer, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But since the ratio is 10:1, which suggests a much higher rf, perhaps the intended answer is the highest option, which is G (0.5%).

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

That seems like a lot for K compared to B, especially considering the dilution factors. Maybe I should think about how the dilutions affect the probabilities.\n\nThe recombination rate would determine the likelihood that a mutation from each phage type combines. If they recombine, the offspring phage will have both mutations. Without recombination, they'll either be the same or different. Since only K shows issues, perhaps the recombination leads to a phage that's more likely to cause problems.\n\nIn experiments where multiple phages infect the same bacteria, the combined effect depends on their individual effects and any interactions between them. Here, since only strain B has issues with the lysogenic phage, maybe the recombination makes the lysogenic phage more potent against strain B.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating recombination frequency. It's often expressed as the percentage of recombinant offspring. In bacterial genetics, the probability of recombination between two loci is approximately p = 2pq, where q is the frequency of the second mutation, assuming no interference. However, since we're dealing with mutations causing different outcomes, maybe it's similar but adjusted for the specific scenario.\n\nGiven that the results show higher plumes on strain K, which might indicate that the phage causing lysogenic fission in strain B is more effective against strain K, the recombination could lead to a phage that's more potent against K. Alternatively, if the phage from strain B's lysogenic mutation is strong enough to cause issues in K despite being less active against itself, that implies some form of positive selection or interaction.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes based on recombination rates. Normally, without recombination, you'd expect each half to have the same distribution. But with recombination, certain combinations would occur more frequently. However, in our case, only K shows issues, suggesting that the combination leads to lethality, while others don't.\n\nIf the recombination rate is high, then fewer recombinants would survive, leading to fewer plumes on the respective strains. Conversely, lower recombination rates would result in more plumes on both. But our data shows more plumes on K than on B, which is counterintuitive unless the recombination somehow enhances the lethality on K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple phages increases the chance of multiple mutations, making the lysogenic phage more effective. This might involve some genetic interaction rather than independent mutations.\n\nTo quantify this, let's consider the dilution factors. The first half was plated at 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium has 1e-7 phage DNA. The second half at 1:10^5, which is much higher. The outcome was 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. The total number of plumes would depend on the number of cells, but since the initial population isn't given, we might assume equal numbers in each half. However, the ratio suggests that the half plated on B had a higher chance of producing more plumes due to lower dilution, but only K did.\n\nThis imbalance could be due to the relative strengths of the phages. If the lysogenic phage from strain B is stronger, it might kill more bacteria when plated at lower dilution levels. On the other hand, even though the lysogenic phage might be more potent, the presence of the recombination could make it more lethal on strain K.\n\nBut wait, another thought: If the recombination creates a phage that's more potent, it might outcompete the normal lysogenic phage, leading to higher survival rates on strain B. However, the problem states that only strain B shows issues with the lysogenic phage, implying that the recombination somehow makes the lysogenic phage more effective against strain B. Alternatively, maybe the recombination leads to a phage that's more likely to replicate, increasing its activity.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of recombination might increase the probability that both mutations occur, thereby making the lysogenic phage more potent. If the recombination rate is such that the lysogenic phage has both mutations, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to higher survival rates and more plumes.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact formula or method used to calculate recombination rates, it's challenging. Another angle: the ratio of plumes indicates that the half plated on K had a higher chance of being affected. Since the dilution factor for K is lower (1e5 vs 1e7), the number of phages per bacterium is higher. If the lysogenic phage from B is more effective against K, then even a lower dilution might still lead to more plumes.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination affects the fitness of the offspring phage, potentially changing their ability to replicate within the host. If the offspring phage is more fit, it might replicate more effectively, leading to more plumes. So the observed difference in plume counts could reflect differences in the fitness of the phages based on their recombination status.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate determines whether the lysogenic phage is more fit, we can model the expected number of plumes based on recombination frequency. For example, if the recombination rate is high, fewer recombinants would be produced, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, low recombination means more plumes.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, they are all percentages: A through G. The possible answers are 1%, 2%, etc., down to 0.05%. To find the correct one, I need to estimate the recombination frequency based on the plume data.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from B is more potent against K, the recombination might increase its effectiveness. Suppose the recombination frequency is R. Then, the number of recombinants (offspring with both mutations) would be proportional to R. The more R, the more efficient the combination.\n\nGiven that only K shows issues, the presence of the lysogenic phage with both mutations must be causing problems in K. Therefore, the recombination must be facilitating this lethality.\n\nTo estimate R, perhaps using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (number of susceptible cells * (1 - R)) + (number of resistant cells * R)\n\nBut without knowing the number of susceptible or resistant cells, this might not help directly. However, the key point is that the higher number of plumes on K suggests that the lysogenic phage with both mutations is more likely to replicate and cause lysis, which is more severe against K.\n\nThus, the recombination must enhance the lethality of the lysogenic phage against K. If the recombination rate is such that the lysogenic phage becomes more potent, it would replicate more efficiently, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf the recombination rate is 0.05% (option D), that's very low. If it's 0.02% (option E), also very low. Lower recombination would mean fewer recombinants, so fewer plumes, but our data shows more plumes on K, which might suggest higher recombination. Wait, but the data says more plumes on K, which might imply that the recombination makes the lysogenic phage more effective against K, requiring more replication.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination leads to a more lethal phenotype, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the recombination frequency. So higher recombination leads to fewer plumes, but in our case, higher plumes on K suggest higher recombination.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused again. Let's try a different approach. Suppose the original lysogenic phage from B is not as effective against K as it would be against itself. When recombined with the mutation from strain K, the new phage is more potent, leading to higher replication and more lysis events on K. Thus, more plumes on K.\n\nHow does recombination affect this? If the recombination creates a phage that is more potent, the number of plumes would increase. The recombination frequency determines how likely the offspring are to be made.\n\nSo, if the recombination occurs with a frequency of X%, the number of recombinants would be proportional to X. The more recombinants, the more plumes, but our data shows more plumes on K, which suggests more recombinants. However, in our case, K showed fewer plumes than B, which is the opposite.\n\nWait, no. The first half was plated on B, and the second half on K. The first half had 40 plumes on B, and the second half had 4 on K. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps I misread the description.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half is B's lawn, and the second half is K's lawn. The number of plumes in each is 40 on B and 4 on K. So the first half (on B) had more plumes, and the second half (on K) had fewer. That suggests that the first half (which is B's lawn) had a higher chance of producing more plumes, possibly because the phage was more effective there, or because of some interaction affecting the replication on B's lawn.\n\nSimilarly, the second half (on K) had fewer plumes, indicating that the phage from the first half wasn't as effective there, perhaps due to the recombination affecting the phage's activity.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination led to a more potent phage, the first half (on B) would have a higher chance of replication and thus more plumes. The second half (on K) would have lower plumes because the phage isn't as effective there anymore, possibly due to the recombination making it less potent.\n\nGiven this, the recombination probably increased the fitness of the phage, making it more potent against K, hence fewer plumes on K. How do we translate this into a recombination frequency?\n\nMaybe the number of plumes reflects the number of times the phage replicated and replicated successfully. If the recombination leads to a more potent phage, it would replicate more, leading to more plumes.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, each bacterium would have a certain number of plumes, say P. With recombination, some cells produce more plumes, and others less. The total number of plumes would depend on the proportion of cells that have the recombinant phage.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the number of recombinant cells would be R*N, where N is the total number of cells. Each such cell produces more plumes, say M, while non-recombinant cells produce P.\n\nTotal plumes = (R*N)*M + ((1-R)*N)*P\n\nWe know that on B, the first half had 40 plumes, and on K, 4. Assuming N is the same for both halves, we can write:\n\n40 = R*M + (1-R)*P\n\n4 = (1-R)*M + R*P\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n(40 - 4) = [R*(M-P)] - [(1-R)*(M-P)]\n\n36 = (R - (1-R))*(M - P)\n\n36 = (2R - 1)*(M - P)\n\nWithout knowing M and P, this is tricky. Alternatively, if the recombinant cells have a higher M, then R would need to be small to explain the higher plumes on B.\n\nWait, but according to the data, on B, we have more plumes than on K. So 40 > 4. If the recombinant cells produce more plumes (M > P), then the term R*M dominates over (1-R)*P. So 40 \u2248 R*M, and 4 \u2248 (1-R)*P.\n\nFrom the first approximation, R \u2248 40/M. From the second, 1-R \u2248 4/P => R \u2248 1 - (4/P).\n\nSetting these equal: 40/M \u2248 1 - (4/P)\n\nBut without knowing M and P, it's hard to solve numerically. However, since the problem provides answer choices, perhaps we can infer based on standard values.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is low (e.g., 0.02%), then R is very small, so M \u2248 P. Then, 40 \u2248 (1 - 0.02/2)*P \u2248 0.99*P => P\u224840 / 0.99\u224840.4. Similarly, 4\u22480.02/2 *P\u22480.01*P => P\u224840. Which aligns. So if R is ~0.02%, then the plume count fits this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is approximately 0.02%, which corresponds to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, I think I might have missed the details about the recombination. Recombination refers to how different regions or mutations interact during replication. If the two mutations are linked, their effect would be more pronounced when they occur together. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B, perhaps the recombination allows the lysogenic mutation to take over when the lytic mutation is present. \n\nThe key here is figuring out the fraction of cells where both mutations occurred. If they recombine, each cell has one mutation from each type, so when you mix them, some cells will have no mutation (both), others will have one, and maybe some will have both. But in the context of phage infection, the lysogenic phage (mutant) would replicate only if the host has the lysogenic mutation, right? So if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host chromosome, allowing it to replicate without inducing lysis.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment: when both mutants are present, the strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage takes over and integrates into strain B's DNA, making it susceptible. The other half, which was only partially affected, must have had no recombination. Plating this on strain K shows fewer plumes, indicating less integrated mutation there.\n\nTo determine the recombination rate, we can use the formula for double reciprocal crosses. The number of recombinants should be proportional to the product of the fractions of each mutation occurring independently. Here, strain B is mostly affected when both mutants are present, meaning the lysogenic mutation is present in most cells. Strain K isn't as affected, suggesting the lysogenic mutation isn't present there. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation occurs in strain B as p. Since strain B is mostly affected, p is high. Similarly, the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation doesn't occur in strain K is q. If recombination occurs, then the expected fraction of cells where both mutations are present (which leads to the effect on strain B) should be approximately pq. \n\nFrom the data:\n- On strain B: 40 plumes out of total N.\n- On strain K: 4 plumes out of its own N.\n\nAssuming each plate is dilution-controlled, the number of cells with the mutation depends on the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means that 1/10^7 of the original culture is used. If the mutation occurs in x% of these cells, then the probability that a cell has the mutation is x%.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the chance that a cell has both mutations would be (p)*(q). However, in reality, they might be dependent due to recombination. Assuming recombination, let r be the recombination frequency. Then, the probability of having both mutations is p*q*(1 + r), but this gets complicated. Alternatively, considering the double crossing, the observed effect on strain B being 40 plumes suggests that the lysogenic mutation is present in 40/(total cells * dilution factor)^something. \n\nAlternatively, using the double cross method: the ratio of plumes on B to the expected without recombination (if no recombination, all lysogenic phages die, so none would affect strain B unless they're integrating). Wait, actually, the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of integration, so the effect on strain B would increase. \n\nIn the absence of recombination, strain B would be unaffected, but with recombination, some cells would have the lysogenic mutation, leading to plasmid formation and thus lytic fission. But wait, in the scenario, the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B, implying that the lysogenic mutation is present in those cells. \n\nSo, the number of plumes on strain B is proportional to the number of cells where the lysogenic mutation is present. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be (number of cells with lysogenic mutation) * (number of cells with lysogenic mutation again). Wait, no, each plume corresponds to a cell where the lysogenic phage successfully replicated, integrating into the host.\n\nGiven that strain B is mostly affected, the lysogenic mutation must be present in a majority of cells. Conversely, strain K is less affected, so the lysogenic mutation isn't present in enough cells. \n\nUsing the double cross approach, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (1 - q) * p * (1 - q) * p, where q is the fraction of cells without the lysogenic mutation on strain K. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better way is to consider the probabilities:\n\nLet\u2019s say the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation occurs in strain B is p. The fraction where it doesn\u2019t occur is (1-p).\n\nSimilarly, the fraction of cells where it doesn\u2019t occur in strain K is q. The fraction where it does occur is (1-q).\n\nWhen both mutations are present, the cell has both mutations, leading to the effect on strain B. When only one mutation is present, the cell may still have an effect depending on whether it's lysogenic or not. Wait, but in our case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B. So, if the lysogenic mutation is present, the phage can integrate and replicate without lysis, affecting strain B. If the phage is non-lytic, it just dies, so it wouldn't affect strain B unless it's lysogenic.\n\nBut in this experiment, both types of phage are present. So, when both mutants are present, the cell has both mutations. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage can integrate, causing it to replicate without lysis, thus affecting strain B. If no recombination, the lysogenic phage cannot integrate, so it would replicate and cause lysis, affecting strain B. However, the lysogenic phage also doesn't lyse, so it shouldn't affect strain B directly. Wait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B. That implies that the lysogenic phage can replicate without lysis, hence integrating into the host and causing issues.\n\nTherefore, recombination would allow the lysogenic mutation to become integrated into the host DNA, making the lysogenic phage effective against strain B. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage can't integrate, so it would replicate and lyse the host, which doesn't explain why strain B is affected. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Actually, without recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate and lyse the host, which would kill the host. But in the experiment, strain B is mostly affected, which suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't lyse the host. Therefore, recombination must allow the lysogenic phage to integrate without causing lysis.\n\nSo, the presence of recombination reduces the likelihood of the lysogenic phage lyse the host. Therefore, the fraction of cells where recombination occurs determines how many cells can have the lysogenic mutation without causing lysis.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency r relates to the number of cells where both mutations are present, which affects the number of plumes observed on strain B. \n\nFrom the experiment:\n- On strain B: 40 plumes out of total plumes. Let's assume the total number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells times the dilution factor.\n- On strain K: 4 plumes out of its own number.\n\nAssuming dilution factors of 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively, the number of cells is (plumes)/(dilution factor). So, for strain B, number of cells = 40 / (1e7) = 4e-6. For strain K, it's 4 / (1e5) = 4e-5.\n\nNow, assuming recombination r, the fraction of cells where both mutations are present is r * p * (1 - q), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected number of cells where both mutations are present is (recombination frequency) * (fraction of cells with lysogenic mutation in B) * (fraction of cells without lysogenic mutation in K).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The expected number of plumes on strain B would depend on the probability that the lysogenic phage successfully integrated into the host DNA. If recombination occurs, the integration is more efficient, increasing the chance of successful replication and thus plating on strain B.\n\nThe formula for double reciprocal plating is often given as:\n\nNumber of plumes on B = (number of cells with lysogenic mutation in B) \u00d7 (probability of successful integration)\n\nWhere the probability of successful integration is related to the recombination frequency. Typically, if recombination is complete, integration is very efficient, so the probability is close to 1. If recombination is partial, the probability decreases.\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes on B is much higher than on K. Let's see:\n\nOn B: 40 plumes\nOn K: 4 plumes\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host, so strain B would be unaffected. With recombination, some cells have the lysogenic mutation, so the phage can integrate and replicate without lysis, leading to plating on strain B. Cells without recombination would have the lysogenic phage lyse the host, killing strain B, but according to the problem statement, strain B is mostly affected, so recombination must be happening.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when both mutants are present, strain B is mostly affected, while when only one mutant is present, it's less affected. That suggests that recombination is reducing the overall effect of the lysogenic phage on strain B.\n\nWait, no. If recombination is happening, the lysogenic phage can integrate, so it doesn't lyse the host. Therefore, the presence of recombination reduces the likelihood of the lysogenic phage lyseing the host, thereby protecting strain B. \n\nSo, the number of plumes on strain B would be higher than expected without recombination, because some cells have the lysogenic mutation, which doesn't lyse the host, hence plating on strain B. Conversely, without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host, so strain B wouldn't be affected, but in our case, strain B is mostly affected, so recombination is occurring.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when both mutants are present, strain B is mostly affected, while when only one mutant is present, it's less affected. This suggests that recombination is necessary for the lysogenic phage to function effectively against strain B, otherwise, it would kill the host.\n\nSo, the fraction of cells where recombination occurs determines how many cells can have the lysogenic mutation without lysis. Therefore, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to the number of cells where recombination has occurred, multiplied by the probability that the lysogenic phage successfully integrates.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lyse the host, so strain B wouldn't be affected. With recombination, the lysogenic phage can integrate, so some cells have the lysogenic mutation, leading to plating on strain B.\n\nThe number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Let's assume that the number of cells where recombination occurs is r, and the number of cells without is (1-r). The fraction of cells where recombination occurs is r.\n\nThe expected number of plumes on strain B would be r * (number of cells with lysogenic mutation) * (probability of integration). But I'm not sure how to model this exactly.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for double reciprocal plating:\n\nNumber of plumes on B = (number of cells with lysogenic mutation in B) \u00d7 (probability of integration)\n\nBut without recombination, the probability of integration is zero, so strain B would have no plumes. With recombination, the probability is greater, so strain B has more plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the probability of integration is p, and with recombination, it's p'.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes on strain B is:\n\n( (number of cells with lysogenic mutation in B) ) \u00d7 p'\n\nSimilarly, without recombination, it's (number of cells with lysogenic mutation in B) \u00d7 p.\n\nBut I don't know the exact values, so maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the ratio of plumes on B to K, which could give an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nPlumes on B: 40\nPlumes on K: 4\nRatio: 40 / 4 = 10\n\nThis suggests that recombination is responsible for 10 times more plumes on B compared to K. So, the recombination frequency is probably around 10%, which is option D (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Wait, but 10 times is quite significant, usually recombination frequencies are in percentages like 0.1% or similar.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1% \nB. 2% \nC. 1.5% \nD. 0.1% \nE. 0.2%\nF. 0.3%\nG. 0.5%\nH. 5%\nI. 0.02%\nJ. 0.05%\n\nOption E is 0.2%, which is 10 times 0.02%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, I think I might have missed the details about the recombination. Recombination refers to how different regions or mutations interact during replication. If the two mutations are linked, their effect would be more pronounced when they occur together. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B, perhaps the recombination allows the lysogenic mutation to take over when the lytic mutation is present. \n\nThe key here is figuring out the fraction of cells where both mutations occurred. If they recombine, each cell has one mutation from each type, so when you mix them, some cells will have no mutation (both), others will have one, and maybe some will have both. But in the context of phage infection, the lysogenic phage (mutant) would replicate only if the host has the lysogenic mutation, right? So if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host chromosome, allowing it to replicate without inducing lysis.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment: when both mutants are present, the strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage takes over and integrates into strain B's DNA, making it susceptible. The other half, which was only partially affected, must have had no recombination. Plating this on strain K shows fewer plumes, indicating less integrated mutation there.\n\nTo determine the recombination rate, we can use the formula for double reciprocal crosses. The number of recombinants should be proportional to the product of the fractions of each mutation occurring independently. Here, strain B is mostly affected when both mutants are present, meaning the lysogenic mutation is present in most cells. Strain K isn't as affected, suggesting the lysogenic mutation isn't present there. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation occurs in strain B as p. Since strain B is mostly affected, p is high. Similarly, the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation doesn't occur in strain K is q. If recombination occurs, then the expected fraction of cells where both mutations are present (which leads to the effect on strain B) should be approximately pq. \n\nFrom the data:\n- On strain B: 40 plumes out of total N.\n- On strain K: 4 plumes out of its own N.\n\nAssuming each plate is dilution-controlled, the number of cells with the mutation depends on the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means that 1/10^7 of the original culture is used. If the mutation occurs in x% of these cells, then the probability that a cell has the mutation is x%.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the chance that a cell has both mutations would be (p)*(q). However, in reality, they might be dependent due to recombination. Assuming recombination, let r be the recombination frequency. Then, the probability of having both mutations is p*q*(1 + r), but this gets complicated. Alternatively, considering the double crossing, the observed effect on strain B being 40 plumes suggests that the lysogenic mutation is present in 40/(total cells * dilution factor)^something. \n\nAlternatively, using the double cross method: the ratio of plumes on B to the expected without recombination (if no recombination, all lysogenic phages die, so none would affect strain B unless they're integrating). Wait, actually, the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of integration, so the effect on strain B would increase. \n\nIn the absence of recombination, strain B would be unaffected, but with recombination, some cells would have the lysogenic mutation, leading to plasmid formation and thus lytic fission. But wait, in the scenario, the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B, implying that the lysogenic mutation is present in those cells. \n\nSo, the number of plumes on strain B is proportional to the number of cells where the lysogenic mutation is present. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be (number of cells with lysogenic mutation) * (number of cells with lysogenic mutation again). Wait, no, each plume corresponds to a cell where the lysogenic phage successfully replicated, integrating into the host.\n\nGiven that strain B is mostly affected, the lysogenic mutation must be present in a majority of cells. Conversely, strain K is less affected, so the lysogenic mutation isn't present in enough cells. \n\nUsing the double cross approach, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (1 - q) * p * (1 - q) * p, where q is the fraction of cells without the lysogenic mutation on strain K. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better way is to consider the probabilities:\n\nLet\u2019s say the fraction of cells where the lysogenic mutation occurs in strain B is p. The fraction where it doesn\u2019t occur is (1-p).\n\nSimilarly, the fraction of cells where it doesn\u2019t occur in strain K is q. The fraction where it does occur is (1-q).\n\nWhen both mutations are present, the cell has both mutations, leading to the effect on strain B. When only one mutation is present, the cell may still have an effect depending on whether it's lysogenic or not. Wait, but in our case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues on strain B.

    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, no, actually, the other way around?",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, no, actually, the other way around? Because if you dilute more (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), that means fewer bacteria are present to form colonies. Dilution 1:10^n reduces the number of viable cells exponentially. So, higher dilution would mean fewer colonies. So, the first sample is more diluted, meaning fewer bacteria, and thus fewer plumes (since each plume represents a new phage). So, the first sample should have fewer plumes. In the experiment, the first sample (diluted 1:10^7) had 40 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:10^5) had 4. That seems contradictory unless there's some interaction affecting the replication rates. \n\nWait, maybe the presence of one mutation affects the replication of the other. If the lysogenic phage has an R plasmid, then perhaps the lysogenic phage can replicate better or reactivate the lysogenic state when the lysogenic phage is already present. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might cause more plasmid loss or gain. Hmm. Another possibility is that the recombination refers to the exchange of DNA segments between the two mutants. Recombination frequency typically refers to how often two genes are exchanged during meiosis, measured as a percentage. But in phages, recombination could also refer to the interaction between two different phages causing changes in the host genome.\n\nIn the experiment, since only the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, but both were present, leading to some effect. However, when plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appeared. Strain K is presumably the wild-type phage. Wait, no, strain K isn't specified beyond being another E. coli strain. Maybe strain K is the lysogenic phage or the wild-type, depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination could be measured using the number of co-occurring plasmids. If the two mutations interact, their combined effect might lead to a change in recombination frequency. For instance, if the two mutants have a certain recombination rate, combining them might increase or decrease that rate. In this case, when only lysogenic was present, the effect was seen; when both were present, fewer plumes appeared, suggesting reduced recombination because the combination led to less independent replication or less efficient integration of the mutations.\n\nSo, the number of plumes depends on the efficiency of the mutations. If the two mutations have a high recombination frequency, they are more likely to produce functional phages, so fewer plumes would indicate lower recombination. Conversely, if they have low recombination, fewer plumes wouldn't make sense because it might suggest increased activity.\n\nLooking at the data: 40 plumes in the first sample (diluted 1:10^7), 4 in the second (diluted 1:10^5). The ratio is about 10 times higher in plumes when the phage is more dilute. So, if we assume that the number of plumes correlates with the recombination frequency, the observed ratio implies that the probability of recombination is low.\n\nBut wait, in such experiments, the number of plumes relates inversely to the square root of the dilution factor. The formula for plume density is N = sqrt(D), where D is the dilution factor. So, if you double the dilution, the number of plumes increases by sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414. Here, from 1:10^5 to 1:10^7, the dilution factor quadruples (from 1e5 to 1e7), so the number of plumes should multiply by approximately 2 (sqrt(4)). But in the experiment, the number went from 4 to 40, which is an increase by 10, which is much larger than expected. This discrepancy suggests that the model may not apply here, possibly due to interactions like cross-recruitment or competition between phages.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the Poisson distribution. The expected number of plumes (\u03bb) under random occurrence would be proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two mutants. Since concentration is inversely proportional to dilution factor, \u03bb \u221d (1/D1 * 1/D2)^0.5 = (1/(D1*D2))^0.5. In our case, D1 = 1e7, D2 = 1e5. So, D1*D2 = 1e12, and sqrt(1e12) = 1e6. But the observed number of plumes is 40, which is much smaller than 1e6. This inconsistency indicates that the assumption of random occurrence is incorrect, and instead, the mutations are interacting in some way.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes increased by a factor of 10 when the dilution factor increased by a factor of 100, it suggests that the recombination frequency is low. Specifically, if the recombination frequency (rf) is the probability that the two mutations occur together, then the number of plumes would relate to rf multiplied by the total number of possible combinations. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's challenging to compute the exact rf.\n\nBut looking at the options provided: the amounts given are percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. The correct answer is likely very low, probably below 1%, considering the significant difference in plume counts despite the large dilution factors.\n\nThe options include F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Given the large difference in plume numbers, even small recombination frequencies would lead to noticeable differences. The fact that 4 plumes appeared on K and 40 on B suggests that the recombination is low. Among the choices, 0.02% and 0.05% are the smallest, followed by 0.1%. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is J (0.05%), as it aligns with the observed data.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Because if you dilute more (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), that means fewer bacteria are present to form colonies. Dilution 1:10^n reduces the number of viable cells exponentially. So, higher dilution would mean fewer colonies. So, the first sample is more diluted, meaning fewer bacteria, and thus fewer plumes (since each plume represents a new phage). So, the first sample should have fewer plumes. In the experiment, the first sample (diluted 1:10^7) had 40 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:10^5) had 4. That seems contradictory unless there's some interaction affecting the replication rates. \n\nWait, maybe the presence of one mutation affects the replication of the other. If the lysogenic phage has an R plasmid, then perhaps the lysogenic phage can replicate better or reactivate the lysogenic state when the lysogenic phage is already present. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might cause more plasmid loss or gain. Hmm. Another possibility is that the recombination refers to the exchange of DNA segments between the two mutants. Recombination frequency typically refers to how often two genes are exchanged during meiosis, measured as a percentage. But in phages, recombination could also refer to the interaction between two different phages causing changes in the host genome.\n\nIn the experiment, since only the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, but both were present, leading to some effect. However, when plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appeared. Strain K is presumably the wild-type phage. Wait, no, strain K isn't specified beyond being another E. coli strain. Maybe strain K is the lysogenic phage or the wild-type, depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination could be measured using the number of co-occurring plasmids. If the two mutations interact, their combined effect might lead to a change in recombination frequency. For instance, if the two mutants have a certain recombination rate, combining them might increase or decrease that rate. In this case, when only lysogenic was present, the effect was seen; when both were present, fewer plumes appeared, suggesting reduced recombination because the combination led to less independent replication or less efficient integration of the mutations.\n\nSo, the number of plumes depends on the efficiency of the mutations. If the two mutations have a high recombination frequency, they are more likely to produce functional phages, so fewer plumes would indicate lower recombination. Conversely, if they have low recombination, fewer plumes wouldn't make sense because it might suggest increased activity.\n\nLooking at the data: 40 plumes in the first sample (diluted 1:10^7), 4 in the second (diluted 1:10^5). The ratio is about 10 times higher in plumes when the phage is more dilute. So, if we assume that the number of plumes correlates with the recombination frequency, the observed ratio implies that the probability of recombination is low.\n\nBut wait, in such experiments, the number of plumes relates inversely to the square root of the dilution factor. The formula for plume density is N = sqrt(D), where D is the dilution factor. So, if you double the dilution, the number of plumes increases by sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414. Here, from 1:10^5 to 1:10^7, the dilution factor quadruples (from 1e5 to 1e7), so the number of plumes should multiply by approximately 2 (sqrt(4)). But in the experiment, the number went from 4 to 40, which is an increase by 10, which is much larger than expected. This discrepancy suggests that the model may not apply here, possibly due to interactions like cross-recruitment or competition between phages.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the Poisson distribution. The expected number of plumes (\u03bb) under random occurrence would be proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two mutants. Since concentration is inversely proportional to dilution factor, \u03bb \u221d (1/D1 * 1/D2)^0.5 = (1/(D1*D2))^0.5. In our case, D1 = 1e7, D2 = 1e5. So, D1*D2 = 1e12, and sqrt(1e12) = 1e6. But the observed number of plumes is 40, which is much smaller than 1e6. This inconsistency indicates that the assumption of random occurrence is incorrect, and instead, the mutations are interacting in some way.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes increased by a factor of 10 when the dilution factor increased by a factor of 100, it suggests that the recombination frequency is low. Specifically, if the recombination frequency (rf) is the probability that the two mutations occur together, then the number of plumes would relate to rf multiplied by the total number of possible combinations. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's challenging to compute the exact rf.\n\nBut looking at the options provided: the amounts given are percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. The correct answer is likely very low, probably below 1%, considering the significant difference in plume counts despite the large dilution factors.\n\nThe options include F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Given the large difference in plume numbers, even small recombination frequencies would lead to noticeable differences. The fact that 4 plumes appeared on K and 40 on B suggests that the recombination is low. Among the choices, 0.02% and 0.05% are the smallest, followed by 0.1%. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is J (0.05%), as it aligns with the observed data.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

So let me clarify:\n\n- One half (let's say half of the total population) is plated on strain B's lawn at a dilution of 1:10^7.\n- The other half (the same volume) is plated on strain K's lawn at a dilution of 1:10^5.\n- Results: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, but if you dilute 1:10^7 and plate on strain B, you expect fewer plumes than if you plate on a different strain. Similarly, diluting 1:10^5 would mean more plumes on strain B than on another strain because higher dilution means more cells tested. But wait, the actual counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nLet me think again. If you plate on strain B's lawn at a low dilution (like 1:10^5), you should see more plumes because each phage infects more cells. Conversely, if you plate at a high dilution (like 1:10^7), you'd expect fewer plumes since each phage infects fewer cells. So if you plate on strain B's lawn at 1:10^5, you'd expect more plumes than if you plate on the same strain at a lower dilution. Wait, but according to the results, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That makes sense because the 1:10^7 dilution would lead to fewer plumes, while the 1:10^5 would lead to more.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. In phages, particularly T_4, this could happen during replication\u2014mutations in the prophage DNA might be passed from parent to offspring or even within the phage itself. However, the presence of multiple mutants complicates things.\n\nIn the experiment, the two types of phages cause different outcomes when infecting strain B. Only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, whereas the lysogenic phage also affects strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is causing an issue in strain B, possibly due to recombination with a mutation in strain K. Alternatively, the mutation might be spreading within the phage itself, leading to recombination.\n\nThe key here is determining whether the mutations are independent or linked (recombine). To determine linkage, we calculate the coefficient of coincidence (CoC), which measures the probability of both events occurring together compared to what would be expected if they were independent.\n\nIn this case, the two events are:\n1. The lysogenic phage infects strain B (causing its death).\n2. The lysogenic phage infects strain K (which didn't die).\n\nIf these were independent, the CoC would be 1/(p * q), where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages in the population for B and q for K. However, since both events occur in the same phage, they're likely dependent. Thus, the observed number of plumes depends on whether the mutations are linked.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage caused issues in B, and the same phage caused issues in K, the occurrence of both events (lysogeny affecting B and K) suggests that the mutations are linked, meaning they recombine. The CoC would indicate the likelihood of this happening.\n\nAssuming equal frequencies for both strains, the expected number of plumes would be 100 (since 1:10^5 has 100 times more cells tested than 1:10^7). But instead, we saw 40 on B and 4 on K. This discrepancy suggests that the actual number of plumes isn't as expected, indicating some degree of recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we compare the observed co-occurrence to the expected. The formula for CoC is (observed / expected) * 100%. Here, observed is 4 + 40 = 44, and expected is 100. So CoC = 44/100 = 44%.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because CoC typically ranges from 0% to 100%, and 44% indicates significant linkage. However, the options provided don't include 44%. They go up to 5%. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The problem states \"four plumes are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So total plumes across both plates are 44. But under normal conditions without recombination, you'd have 100 plumes (assuming 10^5 dilution leads to 100 plumes). So 44/100 = 44% CoC suggests a high level of linkage, meaning the mutations recombine significantly.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, then 0.5%. My calculation gives around 44%, which isn't among the options. Maybe I misunderstood the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plumes per plate to estimate the frequency of mutations.\n\nAnother angle: The ratio of plumes on K to B can help determine the effectiveness of the mutations. Since only the lysogenic phage affected B, the mutation must have occurred in such a way that the lysogenic variant spreads and crosses over with a mutation in K. If the mutation in K was present in enough numbers, the chance of crossing over increases.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes (4 on K vs 40 on B), the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the frequency of the mutation and the likelihood of recombination.\n\nPerhaps using the formula: CoC = (number of recombining plumes)/(total plumes). If 4 recombining plumes occur out of 44 total, then CoC \u2248 9.1%. This still doesn't match any option directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. For two loci that are linked, CoC = n_c / (n1 * n2), where n_c is the number of co-occurring cases, n1 and n2 are the numbers of each case individually. Here, n_c = 4 (plumes on K), n1 = 40 (plumes on B), and n2 = 44 (total plumes). So CoC = 4 / (40*44) \u2248 4 / 1760 \u2248 0.227%, which is approximately 0.23%. That corresponds to option E, 0.05%, but that's too low. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells. If the dilution is 1:10^5, each phage infects 100 cells, so 100 plumes. Similarly, 1:10^7 would lead to 10 cells, so 10 plumes. But the experiment shows 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. Under independence, expectation is 100, so CoC = 44/100 = 44%. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Instead, consider the number of plumes as indicators of successful infections. If the mutation causes recombination, the number of successful infections (plumes) will be reduced. The ratio of plumes on K to B reflects the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven that 4 out of 44 plumes are on K, which is less than on B, it suggests that recombination occurs more frequently. Using the formula for recombination frequency (RF): RF = 1 - e^{-2q}, where q is the allele frequency. But without knowing q, this might not be applicable.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes is 4 on K and 40 on B, the ratio suggests that the mutation in K is present in a proportion that allows recombination. If the mutation in K is rare, the chance of it being crossed over by the mutation in B is higher.\n\nGiven the options, the closest plausible answer is D. 0.1 percent, assuming that the CoC is about 0.1%. But my previous calculation suggested around 44%, which isn't matching. Perhaps I need to reconsider the experimental design.\n\nWait, another thought: The number of plumes on each plate represents the number of successful infections. If the mutation in the lysogenic phage causes recombination with the mutation in the other strain, then the plume count will decrease. If the plume counts are inversely related to the square of the recombination frequency, we can model it.\n\nHowever, without detailed calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is C. 1.5 percent, assuming a moderate level of recombination. But I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014the description says four plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, I might have gotten confused earlier. So let me clarify:\n\n- One half (let's say half of the total population) is plated on strain B's lawn at a dilution of 1:10^7.\n- The other half (the same volume) is plated on strain K's lawn at a dilution of 1:10^5.\n- Results: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, but if you dilute 1:10^7 and plate on strain B, you expect fewer plumes than if you plate on a different strain. Similarly, diluting 1:10^5 would mean more plumes on strain B than on another strain because higher dilution means more cells tested. But wait, the actual counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nLet me think again. If you plate on strain B's lawn at a low dilution (like 1:10^5), you should see more plumes because each phage infects more cells. Conversely, if you plate at a high dilution (like 1:10^7), you'd expect fewer plumes since each phage infects fewer cells. So if you plate on strain B's lawn at 1:10^5, you'd expect more plumes than if you plate on the same strain at a lower dilution. Wait, but according to the results, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That makes sense because the 1:10^7 dilution would lead to fewer plumes, while the 1:10^5 would lead to more.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. In phages, particularly T_4, this could happen during replication\u2014mutations in the prophage DNA might be passed from parent to offspring or even within the phage itself. However, the presence of multiple mutants complicates things.\n\nIn the experiment, the two types of phages cause different outcomes when infecting strain B. Only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, whereas the lysogenic phage also affects strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is causing an issue in strain B, possibly due to recombination with a mutation in strain K. Alternatively, the mutation might be spreading within the phage itself, leading to recombination.\n\nThe key here is determining whether the mutations are independent or linked (recombine). To determine linkage, we calculate the coefficient of coincidence (CoC), which measures the probability of both events occurring together compared to what would be expected if they were independent.\n\nIn this case, the two events are:\n1. The lysogenic phage infects strain B (causing its death).\n2. The lysogenic phage infects strain K (which didn't die).\n\nIf these were independent, the CoC would be 1/(p * q), where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages in the population for B and q for K. However, since both events occur in the same phage, they're likely dependent. Thus, the observed number of plumes depends on whether the mutations are linked.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage caused issues in B, and the same phage caused issues in K, the occurrence of both events (lysogeny affecting B and K) suggests that the mutations are linked, meaning they recombine. The CoC would indicate the likelihood of this happening.\n\nAssuming equal frequencies for both strains, the expected number of plumes would be 100 (since 1:10^5 has 100 times more cells tested than 1:10^7). But instead, we saw 40 on B and 4 on K. This discrepancy suggests that the actual number of plumes isn't as expected, indicating some degree of recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we compare the observed co-occurrence to the expected. The formula for CoC is (observed / expected) * 100%. Here, observed is 4 + 40 = 44, and expected is 100. So CoC = 44/100 = 44%.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because CoC typically ranges from 0% to 100%, and 44% indicates significant linkage. However, the options provided don't include 44%. They go up to 5%. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The problem states \"four plumes are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So total plumes across both plates are 44. But under normal conditions without recombination, you'd have 100 plumes (assuming 10^5 dilution leads to 100 plumes). So 44/100 = 44% CoC suggests a high level of linkage, meaning the mutations recombine significantly.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, then 0.5%. My calculation gives around 44%, which isn't among the options. Maybe I misunderstood the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plumes per plate to estimate the frequency of mutations.\n\nAnother angle: The ratio of plumes on K to B can help determine the effectiveness of the mutations. Since only the lysogenic phage affected B, the mutation must have occurred in such a way that the lysogenic variant spreads and crosses over with a mutation in K. If the mutation in K was present in enough numbers, the chance of crossing over increases.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes (4 on K vs 40 on B), the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the frequency of the mutation and the likelihood of recombination.\n\nPerhaps using the formula: CoC = (number of recombining plumes)/(total plumes). If 4 recombining plumes occur out of 44 total, then CoC \u2248 9.1%. This still doesn't match any option directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. For two loci that are linked, CoC = n_c / (n1 * n2), where n_c is the number of co-occurring cases, n1 and n2 are the numbers of each case individually. Here, n_c = 4 (plumes on K), n1 = 40 (plumes on B), and n2 = 44 (total plumes). So CoC = 4 / (40*44) \u2248 4 / 1760 \u2248 0.227%, which is approximately 0.23%. That corresponds to option E, 0.05%, but that's too low. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells. If the dilution is 1:10^5, each phage infects 100 cells, so 100 plumes. Similarly, 1:10^7 would lead to 10 cells, so 10 plumes. But the experiment shows 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. Under independence, expectation is 100, so CoC = 44/100 = 44%. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Instead, consider the number of plumes as indicators of successful infections. If the mutation causes recombination, the number of successful infections (plumes) will be reduced. The ratio of plumes on K to B reflects the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven that 4 out of 44 plumes are on K, which is less than on B, it suggests that recombination occurs more frequently. Using the formula for recombination frequency (RF): RF = 1 - e^{-2q}, where q is the allele frequency. But without knowing q, this might not be applicable.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes is 4 on K and 40 on B, the ratio suggests that the mutation in K is present in a proportion that allows recombination. If the mutation in K is rare, the chance of it being crossed over by the mutation in B is higher.\n\nGiven the options, the closest plausible answer is D. 0.1 percent, assuming that the CoC is about 0.1%. But my previous calculation suggested around 44%, which isn't matching. Perhaps I need to reconsider the experimental design.\n\nWait, another thought: The number of plumes on each plate represents the number of successful infections. If the mutation in the lysogenic phage causes recombination with the mutation in the other strain, then the plume count will decrease. If the plume counts are inversely related to the square of the recombination frequency, we can model it.\n\nHowever, without detailed calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is C. 1.5 percent, assuming a moderate level of recombination. But I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, I remember from my studies that when two mutations are linked, their combination leads to a certain number of recombinant individuals. In a typical double-reciprocal test, if you have two genes, each mutation would create a recombinant allele. The expected outcome depends on the recombination fraction, which is the proportion of times the two alleles are inherited together.\n\nIn this case, the two mutations cause different outcomes when applied together. The lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, while the lytic one does. So, when these two are combined, they should produce a recombinant phage that can lyse E. coli strain B but not K. However, since both types are present, we see that E. coli strain B is more affected than normal, indicating some interaction where the two mutations might be combining to cause an effect. \n\nThe experiment uses a double population approach. The first half is tested on strain B's lawn with the lysogenic phage, and the second half is tested on strain K's lawn with the lytic phage. The results show that 40% of the colonies on strain B's lawn are affected (lysed), and 8% on strain K's lawn are affected. This suggests that when both mutations are present, the combined effect is less than either mutation alone. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the affected strain is B, meaning that when both mutations are present, the phage behaves like strain B, causing lyse on B but not K. But in our experiment, when both types are present, the entire lawn is divided into two parts: one part was treated with the lysogenic phage on B, and another part with the lytic phage on K. The results showed 40% on B and 8% on K. \n\nThis seems contradictory because if both mutations are present, you'd expect both strains to be affected similarly. But instead, only a small portion of the K's lawn was affected. That implies that the presence of both mutants leads to a lower likelihood of the phage being effective compared to each mutation alone. \n\nI think this relates to the concept of interference between the two mutations. If they are independent, the probability of both occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. But here, the observed effect shows that the combined presence reduces the effectiveness, suggesting that they might be interacting or recombining. \n\nAnother angle is the calculation of the recombination frequency. The formula for the double population method is:\n\np = 1 - (q + r + sr)\n\nWhere p is the percentage of recombinant colonies, q and r are the frequencies of the recessive and dominant phenotypes, respectively, s is the interference coefficient, and r is the interference rate. But maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants can help determine the actual recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that in the first treatment (lytic on B), only 20% of colonies were affected (lysed), and in the second treatment (lysogenic on K), about 8% were affected. If there was no recombination, then treating with the lysogenic on B would give the same as treating with the lytic on K, but here they differ. The difference indicates that there's some interaction between the two mutants.\n\nThe classic formula for calculating the recombination fraction (c) is based on the equation:\n\nc = [p1 - (p1 * p2)] / p2\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to use the observed data. Since in the first case, treating with lysogenic on B gives 20% lyse (so 80% do not lyse), and in the second case, treating with lytic on K gives 8% lyse, the expected if there was no recombination would be that the effects are additive. But here, the observed effects are different, leading to a conclusion that there's recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the double population method, the expected number of recombinant colonies would be given by:\n\nExpected recombinant = (number of colonies in first treatment) * (probability of recombination)\n\nIf the two treatments (lytic on B and lytic on K) are independent, the expected recombinant would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. But here, the results don't align with independence; thus, recombination must be occurring.\n\nCalculating the exact recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nc = [ (number of recombinant colonies) ] / [ total number ]\n\nBut in this case, the total number isn't provided directly. Instead, the results are split into two groups: one with 40% on B and 8% on K. Assuming equal numbers in each group, let's say N colonies in each group. Then, the number of recombinant colonies would be N*(0.4 + 0.08 - c), where c is the recombination fraction.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula for the double population method is:\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies = (n1 * n2) * (1 - c)\n\nWhere n1 is the number treated with lysogenic on B, and n2 is the number treated with lytic on K.\n\nAssuming equal numbers, say n1 = n2 = N.\n\nThen, Number of recombinant colonies = N*N*(1 - c) = N\u00b2(1 - c)\n\nFrom the results, the number of recombinant colonies would correspond to the sum of the number affected in both groups minus the non-recombinant ones. But wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed data.\n\nIn the first group (lytic on B): 20% lyse \u2192 80% do not lyse.\nIn the second group (lysogenic on K): 8% lyse \u2192 92% do not lyse.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the expected number of lyse in the second group would also be 20%, but here it's 8%. Thus, the difference suggests that recombination has occurred.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (c):\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhere p1 is the proportion of colonies lyse in the first treatment, and p2 is the proportion in the second treatment.\n\nPlugging in:\n\np1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.08\n\nc = (0.2 - 0.08) / (1 - 0.08) = 0.12 / 0.92 \u2248 0.1304, which is approximately 13%.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is:\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nSo, with p1=0.2, p2=0.08,\n\nc = (0.2-0.08)/(1-0.08)=0.12/0.92\u22480.13, which is about 13%.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. The highest is G (0.5%), which is higher than 13%. Maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the interference. The formula involving interference (h) is:\n\nc = h * (p1 * p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nBut without knowing h, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the formula is c = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/ (1 - p2).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct expression is:\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhich again gives around 13%.\n\nSince 13% is closer to 1% (option A) or 2% (option B). Option A is 1%, which is close to 13%, but perhaps I should check the calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted something. Let me try again.\n\nIf there's recombination, the probability that a colony is recombinant is p1 + p2 - 2*c_p1_p2. But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should refer back to standard formulas.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula for recombination frequency based on double population testing is:\n\nc = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nSo, plugging in p1=0.2, p2=0.08:\n\nNumerator = 0.2 + 0.08 - (0.2*0.08) = 0.28 - 0.016 = 0.264\n\nDenominator = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92\n\nThus, c = 0.264 / 0.92 \u2248 0.2869, which is approximately 28.7%.\n\nThat's way higher than any of the options. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is c = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2) when assuming independent assortment. Given that p1=0.2 and p2=0.08,\n\nc = (0.2 - 0.08) / (1 - 0.08) = 0.12 / 0.92 \u2248 0.130, which is about 13%.\n\nStill, this doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Wait, the total number of colonies in each group would depend on how they were plated. If each half was treated with a certain dilution and then plated, the number of colonies would relate to the concentration.\n\nSuppose each half was treated with a dilution of 1:10^7 and then plated on strain B. If the efficiency of each treatment is e, then the number of colonies would be proportional to e * (1 - e), assuming Poisson distribution.\n\nSimilarly, for the other half treated with 1:10^5 and then on strain K.\n\nLet me denote e1 as the efficiency for treating with lysogenic on B, and e2 for treating with lytic on K.\n\nEfficiency e is calculated as e = p * (1 - p), where p is the probability of lyse.\n\nFor the first group: e1 = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16\n\nFor the second group: e2 = 0.08 * 0.92 = 0.0736\n\nNow, the number of colonies in each group is proportional to e1 and e2, respectively. Let's assume N1 = e1 * N and N2 = e2 * N.\n\nThe ratio of colonies in group 1 to group 2 is N1/N2 = e1/e2 = 0.16 / 0.0736 \u2248 2.1739.\n\nHowever, according to the experiment, group 1 had 40 plasmids and group 2 had 40 plasmids? No, the counts are four and forty. Wait, the problem states that four were found on K and forty on B. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the setup says:\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nSo, group 1: 1:10^7 dilution on strain B, group 2: 1:10^5 dilution on strain K.\n\nIn group 1, 40 colonies on B, and in group 2, 40 colonies on K. Wait, no, it's the other way around. It says four on K and forty on B. So group 1 (lytic on B) had 40 on B, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) had 40 on K. Wait, that seems inconsistent because the amounts are the same.\n\nNo, wait, let me read carefully:\n\n\"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nAh, okay, so group 1 (lytic on B) was plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) was plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the numbers are similar. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps group 1 (lytic on B) resulted in 40 plumes on B's lawn, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) resulted in 40 plumes on K's lawn. But that still doesn't resolve why one is 40 and the other 40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers indicate the total plasmid load. For example, group 1 had a total of 40 plasmids, and group 2 had 40 plasmids as well, but the distribution among strains was different.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. So group 1 had 40 colonies on B, and group 2 had 40 on K. That means the total number of colonies in each group is 40. But group 1 was treated with 1:10^7 on strain B, and group 2 was treated with 1:10^5 on strain K. Therefore, the dilutions suggest that group 1 has a much lower efficiency than group 2, but the results show 40 colonies in each group, implying high efficiency.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the initial assumption about the efficiency may be incorrect. Perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nGroup 1: Diluted 1:10^7 on B. Efficiency e1 = p1*(1-p1)\nGroup 2: Diluted 1:10^5 on K. Efficiency e2 = p2*(1-p2)\n\nTotal colonies in group 1: C1 = N * e1\nTotal colonies in group 2: C2 = N * e2\n\nThe number of colonies that lyse (reproduce effectively) would be:\n\nReproduced in group 1: R1 = C1 * p1\nReproduced in group 2: R2 = C2 * p2\n\nThe number of colonies that lyse (non-reproduced) would be:\n\nNot reproduced in group 1: NR1 = C1 * (1 - p1)\nNot reproduced in group 2: NR2 = C2 * (1 - p2)\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nNR1 = 40\nNR2 = 40\n\nAnd the total number of colonies in each group is such that NR1 = 40 and NR2 = 40.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to find e1 and e2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total plasmid loads in each group are the same. Wait, no, the problem states that group 1 had 40 plasmids on B's lawn, and group 2 had 40 plasmids on K's lawn. So, both groups had the same total plasmid count.\n\nTherefore, C1 = C2 = 40.\n\nBut group 1 was treated with 1:10^7, and group 2 with 1:10^5, which suggests that group 1 should have a much lower efficiency than group 2. However, the results show that group 1 had 40 colonies lyse, and group 2 had 40 as well. This is puzzling.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of plasmids in each group is the same. Let's assume that after dilution, the number of plasmids per cell is the same across both groups. Therefore, the efficiency (e1 and e2) would be related to the dilution factors.\n\nBut this line of reasoning isn't helping. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the key lies in the fact that when both mutations are present, the combined effect is less than either mutation alone, indicating some interaction. The degree of interaction can be estimated using the formula:\n\nInterference h = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nIn this case, p1=0.2 and p2=0.08.\n\nSo,\n\nh = (0.2 + 0.08 - 0.2*0.08) / (1 - 0.08)\nh = (0.28 - 0.016) / 0.92\nh = 0.264 / 0.92 \u2248 0.2869 or ~28.7%\n\nInterference is often expressed as the probability of double crossing. So, if there is significant interference, the actual recombination frequency is reduced.\n\nBut how does this relate to the question? The question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, it's asking for the actual recombination frequency, which could be influenced by interference.\n\nHowever, the options provided are percentages, so likely the correct answer is around 13%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, going back to the basic definition: Recombination frequency (c) is the proportion of offspring that are recombinant (i.e., inherit one chromatid from each parent). In this case, the mutations lead to a recombinant phenotype when treated together, but when treated separately, the effects vary.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected recombinant proportion would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, since the results show that when both are present, fewer recombinants occur, it suggests that the two mutations are linked and recombine more frequently than expected under independent assortment.\n\nUsing the formula for double population testing:\n\nc = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nAs before, with p1=0.2 and p2=0.08,\n\nc \u2248 (0.287) / 0.92 \u2248 0.311 or 31.1%.\n\nThis suggests a significant recombination frequency, which conflicts with the options provided. The available answers are up to 0.5%.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, maybe the formula should account for the fact that the second mutation affects the first, making the overall effect even less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed data.\n\nLet me consider that when both mutations are present, the effect is diminished. The observed number of recombinants (or the lack thereof) suggests that the two mutations are not assorting",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember from my studies that when two mutations are linked, their combination leads to a certain number of recombinant individuals. In a typical double-reciprocal test, if you have two genes, each mutation would create a recombinant allele. The expected outcome depends on the recombination fraction, which is the proportion of times the two alleles are inherited together.\n\nIn this case, the two mutations cause different outcomes when applied together. The lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, while the lytic one does. So, when these two are combined, they should produce a recombinant phage that can lyse E. coli strain B but not K. However, since both types are present, we see that E. coli strain B is more affected than normal, indicating some interaction where the two mutations might be combining to cause an effect. \n\nThe experiment uses a double population approach. The first half is tested on strain B's lawn with the lysogenic phage, and the second half is tested on strain K's lawn with the lytic phage. The results show that 40% of the colonies on strain B's lawn are affected (lysed), and 8% on strain K's lawn are affected. This suggests that when both mutations are present, the combined effect is less than either mutation alone. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the affected strain is B, meaning that when both mutations are present, the phage behaves like strain B, causing lyse on B but not K. But in our experiment, when both types are present, the entire lawn is divided into two parts: one part was treated with the lysogenic phage on B, and another part with the lytic phage on K. The results showed 40% on B and 8% on K. \n\nThis seems contradictory because if both mutations are present, you'd expect both strains to be affected similarly. But instead, only a small portion of the K's lawn was affected. That implies that the presence of both mutants leads to a lower likelihood of the phage being effective compared to each mutation alone. \n\nI think this relates to the concept of interference between the two mutations. If they are independent, the probability of both occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. But here, the observed effect shows that the combined presence reduces the effectiveness, suggesting that they might be interacting or recombining. \n\nAnother angle is the calculation of the recombination frequency. The formula for the double population method is:\n\np = 1 - (q + r + sr)\n\nWhere p is the percentage of recombinant colonies, q and r are the frequencies of the recessive and dominant phenotypes, respectively, s is the interference coefficient, and r is the interference rate. But maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants can help determine the actual recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that in the first treatment (lytic on B), only 20% of colonies were affected (lysed), and in the second treatment (lysogenic on K), about 8% were affected. If there was no recombination, then treating with the lysogenic on B would give the same as treating with the lytic on K, but here they differ. The difference indicates that there's some interaction between the two mutants.\n\nThe classic formula for calculating the recombination fraction (c) is based on the equation:\n\nc = [p1 - (p1 * p2)] / p2\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to use the observed data. Since in the first case, treating with lysogenic on B gives 20% lyse (so 80% do not lyse), and in the second case, treating with lytic on K gives 8% lyse, the expected if there was no recombination would be that the effects are additive. But here, the observed effects are different, leading to a conclusion that there's recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the double population method, the expected number of recombinant colonies would be given by:\n\nExpected recombinant = (number of colonies in first treatment) * (probability of recombination)\n\nIf the two treatments (lytic on B and lytic on K) are independent, the expected recombinant would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. But here, the results don't align with independence; thus, recombination must be occurring.\n\nCalculating the exact recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nc = [ (number of recombinant colonies) ] / [ total number ]\n\nBut in this case, the total number isn't provided directly. Instead, the results are split into two groups: one with 40% on B and 8% on K. Assuming equal numbers in each group, let's say N colonies in each group. Then, the number of recombinant colonies would be N*(0.4 + 0.08 - c), where c is the recombination fraction.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula for the double population method is:\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies = (n1 * n2) * (1 - c)\n\nWhere n1 is the number treated with lysogenic on B, and n2 is the number treated with lytic on K.\n\nAssuming equal numbers, say n1 = n2 = N.\n\nThen, Number of recombinant colonies = N*N*(1 - c) = N\u00b2(1 - c)\n\nFrom the results, the number of recombinant colonies would correspond to the sum of the number affected in both groups minus the non-recombinant ones. But wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed data.\n\nIn the first group (lytic on B): 20% lyse \u2192 80% do not lyse.\nIn the second group (lysogenic on K): 8% lyse \u2192 92% do not lyse.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the expected number of lyse in the second group would also be 20%, but here it's 8%. Thus, the difference suggests that recombination has occurred.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (c):\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhere p1 is the proportion of colonies lyse in the first treatment, and p2 is the proportion in the second treatment.\n\nPlugging in:\n\np1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.08\n\nc = (0.2 - 0.08) / (1 - 0.08) = 0.12 / 0.92 \u2248 0.1304, which is approximately 13%.\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is option J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is:\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nSo, with p1=0.2, p2=0.08,\n\nc = (0.2-0.08)/(1-0.08)=0.12/0.92\u22480.13, which is about 13%.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. The highest is G (0.5%), which is higher than 13%. Maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the interference. The formula involving interference (h) is:\n\nc = h * (p1 * p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nBut without knowing h, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the formula is c = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/ (1 - p2).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct expression is:\n\nc = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhich again gives around 13%.\n\nSince 13% is closer to 1% (option A) or 2% (option B). Option A is 1%, which is close to 13%, but perhaps I should check the calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted something. Let me try again.\n\nIf there's recombination, the probability that a colony is recombinant is p1 + p2 - 2*c_p1_p2. But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should refer back to standard formulas.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula for recombination frequency based on double population testing is:\n\nc = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nSo, plugging in p1=0.2, p2=0.08:\n\nNumerator = 0.2 + 0.08 - (0.2*0.08) = 0.28 - 0.016 = 0.264\n\nDenominator = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92\n\nThus, c = 0.264 / 0.92 \u2248 0.2869, which is approximately 28.7%.\n\nThat's way higher than any of the options. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is c = (p1 - p2) / (1 - p2) when assuming independent assortment. Given that p1=0.2 and p2=0.08,\n\nc = (0.2 - 0.08) / (1 - 0.08) = 0.12 / 0.92 \u2248 0.130, which is about 13%.\n\nStill, this doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Wait, the total number of colonies in each group would depend on how they were plated. If each half was treated with a certain dilution and then plated, the number of colonies would relate to the concentration.\n\nSuppose each half was treated with a dilution of 1:10^7 and then plated on strain B. If the efficiency of each treatment is e, then the number of colonies would be proportional to e * (1 - e), assuming Poisson distribution.\n\nSimilarly, for the other half treated with 1:10^5 and then on strain K.\n\nLet me denote e1 as the efficiency for treating with lysogenic on B, and e2 for treating with lytic on K.\n\nEfficiency e is calculated as e = p * (1 - p), where p is the probability of lyse.\n\nFor the first group: e1 = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16\n\nFor the second group: e2 = 0.08 * 0.92 = 0.0736\n\nNow, the number of colonies in each group is proportional to e1 and e2, respectively. Let's assume N1 = e1 * N and N2 = e2 * N.\n\nThe ratio of colonies in group 1 to group 2 is N1/N2 = e1/e2 = 0.16 / 0.0736 \u2248 2.1739.\n\nHowever, according to the experiment, group 1 had 40 plasmids and group 2 had 40 plasmids? No, the counts are four and forty. Wait, the problem states that four were found on K and forty on B. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the setup says:\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nSo, group 1: 1:10^7 dilution on strain B, group 2: 1:10^5 dilution on strain K.\n\nIn group 1, 40 colonies on B, and in group 2, 40 colonies on K. Wait, no, it's the other way around. It says four on K and forty on B. So group 1 (lytic on B) had 40 on B, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) had 40 on K. Wait, that seems inconsistent because the amounts are the same.\n\nNo, wait, let me read carefully:\n\n\"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nAh, okay, so group 1 (lytic on B) was plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) was plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the numbers are similar. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps group 1 (lytic on B) resulted in 40 plumes on B's lawn, and group 2 (lysogenic on K) resulted in 40 plumes on K's lawn. But that still doesn't resolve why one is 40 and the other 40.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers indicate the total plasmid load. For example, group 1 had a total of 40 plasmids, and group 2 had 40 plasmids as well, but the distribution among strains was different.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. So group 1 had 40 colonies on B, and group 2 had 40 on K. That means the total number of colonies in each group is 40. But group 1 was treated with 1:10^7 on strain B, and group 2 was treated with 1:10^5 on strain K. Therefore, the dilutions suggest that group 1 has a much lower efficiency than group 2, but the results show 40 colonies in each group, implying high efficiency.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the initial assumption about the efficiency may be incorrect. Perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nGroup 1: Diluted 1:10^7 on B. Efficiency e1 = p1*(1-p1)\nGroup 2: Diluted 1:10^5 on K. Efficiency e2 = p2*(1-p2)\n\nTotal colonies in group 1: C1 = N * e1\nTotal colonies in group 2: C2 = N * e2\n\nThe number of colonies that lyse (reproduce effectively) would be:\n\nReproduced in group 1: R1 = C1 * p1\nReproduced in group 2: R2 = C2 * p2\n\nThe number of colonies that lyse (non-reproduced) would be:\n\nNot reproduced in group 1: NR1 = C1 * (1 - p1)\nNot reproduced in group 2: NR2 = C2 * (1 - p2)\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nNR1 = 40\nNR2 = 40\n\nAnd the total number of colonies in each group is such that NR1 = 40 and NR2 = 40.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to find e1 and e2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total plasmid loads in each group are the same. Wait, no, the problem states that group 1 had 40 plasmids on B's lawn, and group 2 had 40 plasmids on K's lawn. So, both groups had the same total plasmid count.\n\nTherefore, C1 = C2 = 40.\n\nBut group 1 was treated with 1:10^7, and group 2 with 1:10^5, which suggests that group 1 should have a much lower efficiency than group 2. However, the results show that group 1 had 40 colonies lyse, and group 2 had 40 as well. This is puzzling.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of plasmids in each group is the same. Let's assume that after dilution, the number of plasmids per cell is the same across both groups. Therefore, the efficiency (e1 and e2) would be related to the dilution factors.\n\nBut this line of reasoning isn't helping. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the key lies in the fact that when both mutations are present, the combined effect is less than either mutation alone, indicating some interaction. The degree of interaction can be estimated using the formula:\n\nInterference h = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nIn this case, p1=0.2 and p2=0.08.\n\nSo,\n\nh = (0.2 + 0.08 - 0.2*0.08) / (1 - 0.08)\nh = (0.28 - 0.016) / 0.92\nh = 0.264 / 0.92 \u2248 0.2869 or ~28.7%\n\nInterference is often expressed as the probability of double crossing. So, if there is significant interference, the actual recombination frequency is reduced.\n\nBut how does this relate to the question? The question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, it's asking for the actual recombination frequency, which could be influenced by interference.\n\nHowever, the options provided are percentages, so likely the correct answer is around 13%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, going back to the basic definition: Recombination frequency (c) is the proportion of offspring that are recombinant (i.e., inherit one chromatid from each parent). In this case, the mutations lead to a recombinant phenotype when treated together, but when treated separately, the effects vary.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected recombinant proportion would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, since the results show that when both are present, fewer recombinants occur, it suggests that the two mutations are linked and recombine more frequently than expected under independent assortment.\n\nUsing the formula for double population testing:\n\nc = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (1 - p2)\n\nAs before, with p1=0.2 and p2=0.08,\n\nc \u2248 (0.287) / 0.92 \u2248 0.311 or 31.1%.\n\nThis suggests a significant recombination frequency, which conflicts with the options provided. The available answers are up to 0.5%.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, maybe the formula should account for the fact that the second mutation affects the first, making the overall effect even less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed data.\n\nLet me consider that when both mutations are present, the effect is diminished. The observed number of recombinants (or the lack thereof) suggests that the two mutations are not assorting",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, actually, let me correct myself.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, actually, let me correct myself. When you plate on a lawn of strain X, any plasmid that integrates into the phage genome will cause a lytic burst if it's wild-type (because it can replicate), but if it's resistant (like a mutation), it won't lyse and will cause a lysogenic response. So in this case, when the phage is plated on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phage should cause a problem, while the wild-type phage would just lyse without causing issues. However, since the phages are in different dilutions, maybe the number of phages present affects whether they integrate.\n\nThe experiment says that half the cells (when plated on strain B's lawn) resulted in a saturated count of 40 plumes, meaning most cells have integrated the mutation from the lysogenic phage. The other half, when plated on strain K's lawn, had only 4 plumes, indicating fewer integrations. Wait, no\u2014the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So for the first group, they're plated on B's lawn, expecting lysogenic effects, but the second group is plated on K's lawn, where only the lysogenic phage might cause problems, but the presence of the wild-type phage could lead to some integration too. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. When the phages are present at low concentrations (1:10^5), the chance of integration is lower. So if the lysogenic phage is present, it might integrate into the phage genome, leading to more lysogenic response on strain B. But wait, the initial statement said that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage caused issues. Maybe the presence of both types leads to some competition, but the key point is about recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, after treating the E. coli strain B with the two phages, the outcome was that the strain B was mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage must be integrating into the phage genome. Because if the lysogenic phage didn't integrate, it wouldn't cause issues, so all the cells would look normal. But since some cells did show lysis, integration must have occurred. Now, how much integration happened depends on the ratio of the two phages.\n\nWhen the phages are plated on different backgrounds (strain B vs. strain K), the level of integration changes. For example, if the lysogenic phage is more abundant, it has a higher chance of integrating. If the lysogenic is less abundant, integration is lower. The test used is called the \"phenotype test,\" where if a certain threshold is reached, it indicates recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombinant offspring is:\n\n% Recombination = ((q1 + q2 - Q)) / (2)\n\nWhere q1 and q2 are the frequencies of each mutation in the gametes, and Q is the frequency of the heterozygote.\n\nBut in this scenario, we don't have q1 and q2 directly. Instead, we have the results from two plates. Each plate represents a generation of infection. The first group (plated on strain B) showed a high degree of integration, while the second group (plated on strain K) showed moderate integration. The difference in the number of plumes gives an indication of the relative levels of integration.\n\nIn the first plate, the strain B cells were mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage genome. In the second plate, when the phages were plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appeared instead of 40 on strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated more efficiently against strain K than against strain B. Therefore, the recombination occurs because the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage genome, and its ability to do so varies depending on the host strain.\n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we compare the observed frequencies of the two mutations in the offspring. The expected outcome under complete recombination would be a certain proportion, but in reality, incomplete recombination happens, leading to a mix of parental and recombinant genotypes. The percentage of recombinant individuals can be estimated using statistical methods based on the observed counts.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Strain B: 40 plumes (most cells integrated)\n- Strain K: 4 plumes (less integration)\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated more efficiently against strain K than against strain B. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of recombinant plumes would be around half of the total plumes. However, since the observed numbers differ significantly, it indicates partial recombination. The exact calculation requires knowing the allele frequencies and applying the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler method is to calculate the percentage of each type compared to the total. For the first group (strain B), the percentage of recombinant plumes is 40/44 (since 40+4=44). For the second group (strain K), it's 4/44. Using these percentages, we can infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nCalculating:\n- For strain B: (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%\n- For strain K: (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.1%\n\nThese percentages suggest that the lysogenic phage integrates more efficiently against strain K, implying some recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\nA. 1 percent\nB. 2 percent\nC. 1.5 percent\nD. 0.1 percent\nE. 0.2 percent\nF. 0.3 percent\nG. 0.5 percent\nH. 5 percent\nI. 0.02 percent\nJ. 0.05 percent\n\nNone of these options match the calculated approximately 90-10% values. It seems I made a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the results. The experiment involved two groups: one with low dilution (1:10^7) and another with even lower dilution (1:10^5). The first group, when plated on strain B, showed 40 plumes, likely due to full integration. The second group, when plated on strain K, showed 4 plumes, indicating only partial integration. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrates partially when present alongside the wild-type phage, implying some degree of recombination.\n\nThe standard method to determine the percentage of recombination is to compare the observed frequencies. If the two mutations are partially linked, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the crossover frequency. However, without specific allele frequencies, it's challenging to apply the Hardy-Weinberg formula directly.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of recombinant to parental plumes. For the first group (strain B):\n- Recombinant = 40\n- Parental = 4\n- Total = 44\nSo, recombination rate r = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nFor the second group (strain K):\n- Recombinant = 4\n- Parental = 40\n- Total = 44\nRecombination rate r = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%\n\nThis indicates a very high degree of recombination. None of the answer choices reflect such a high value, which makes me think I might have misunderstood the problem.\n\nPerhaps the question asks for the percentage of each mutation within the population rather than the recombination itself. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the level of integration in terms of plasmids, not recombination.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Given that the recombination rate appears to be around 90%, which isn't among the options, I suspect there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of each mutation in the population, not recombination. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are percentages like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 5%. Since my calculated recombination rates are over 90%, none of these options fit. Perhaps the question intended to ask about the frequency of each mutation, not recombination.\n\nLooking back, the problem states: \"determine the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, the closest would be H. 5 percent, but I thought the recombination was over 90%. Alternatively, perhaps the actual recombination is lower, and the confusion arises from the experimental design.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to interpret this is that when both phages are present, the E. coli strain B shows significant recombination, as seen through the increased number of plumes on strain B compared to strain K. The exact calculation might involve comparing the frequency of the mutations in the offspring.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are partially linked, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the equation:\n\nr = (q1 * q2) / p1 * p2\n\nBut without knowing the allele frequencies, it's tricky. Alternatively, the percentage of recombinant plumes can be approximated.\n\nFrom the first group (strain B):\n- Recombinant plumes = 40\n- Total plumes = 44\n- Recombinant frequency = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nFrom the second group (strain K):\n- Recombinant plumes = 4\n- Total plumes = 44\n- Recombinant frequency = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%\n\nSince the lysogenic phage integrates more efficiently against strain K, the recombination frequency is highest against that strain, which aligns with the higher recombinant frequency (90.9%).\n\nHowever, the answer options don't include anything close to 90%. The closest is option H (5%) and G (0.5%). This discrepancy suggests that either the interpretation is incorrect, or I've made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of each mutation within the population, not recombination. For example, if in the population, 1% have the lysogenic phage mutation and 5% have the wild-type, then the recombination would depend on their interaction.\n\nBut given the ambiguity and the provided options, I think the intended answer might be H. 5 percent, assuming that the recombination rate is lower than expected, possibly due to experimental factors or a misunderstanding in the experiment's design.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The test used is called the \"phenotype test,\" where if a certain threshold is reached, it indicates recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombinant offspring is:\n\n% Recombination = ((q1 + q2 - Q)) / (2)\n\nWhere q1 and q2 are the frequencies of each mutation in the gametes, and Q is the frequency of the heterozygote.\n\nBut in this scenario, we don't have q1 and q2 directly. Instead, we have the results from two plates. Each plate represents a generation of infection. The first group (plated on strain B) showed a high degree of integration, while the second group (plated on strain K) showed moderate integration. The difference in the number of plumes gives an indication of the relative levels of integration.\n\nIn the first plate, the strain B cells were mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage genome. In the second plate, when the phages were plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appeared instead of 40 on strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated more efficiently against strain K than against strain B. Therefore, the recombination occurs because the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage genome, and its ability to do so varies depending on the host strain.\n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we compare the observed frequencies of the two mutations in the offspring. The expected outcome under complete recombination would be a certain proportion, but in reality, incomplete recombination happens, leading to a mix of parental and recombinant genotypes. The percentage of recombinant individuals can be estimated using statistical methods based on the observed counts.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Strain B: 40 plumes (most cells integrated)\n- Strain K: 4 plumes (less integration)\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated more efficiently against strain K than against strain B. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of recombinant plumes would be around half of the total plumes. However, since the observed numbers differ significantly, it indicates partial recombination. The exact calculation requires knowing the allele frequencies and applying the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler method is to calculate the percentage of each type compared to the total. For the first group (strain B), the percentage of recombinant plumes is 40/44 (since 40+4=44). For the second group (strain K), it's 4/44. Using these percentages, we can infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nCalculating:\n- For strain B: (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%\n- For strain K: (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.1%\n\nThese percentages suggest that the lysogenic phage integrates more efficiently against strain K, implying some recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\nA. 1 percent\nB. 2 percent\nC. 1.5 percent\nD. 0.1 percent\nE. 0.2 percent\nF. 0.3 percent\nG. 0.5 percent\nH. 5 percent\nI. 0.02 percent\nJ. 0.05 percent\n\nNone of these options match the calculated approximately 90-10% values. It seems I made a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the results. The experiment involved two groups: one with low dilution (1:10^7) and another with even lower dilution (1:10^5). The first group, when plated on strain B, showed 40 plumes, likely due to full integration. The second group, when plated on strain K, showed 4 plumes, indicating only partial integration. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrates partially when present alongside the wild-type phage, implying some degree of recombination.\n\nThe standard method to determine the percentage of recombination is to compare the observed frequencies. If the two mutations are partially linked, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the crossover frequency. However, without specific allele frequencies, it's challenging to apply the Hardy-Weinberg formula directly.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of recombinant to parental plumes. For the first group (strain B):\n- Recombinant = 40\n- Parental = 4\n- Total = 44\nSo, recombination rate r = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nFor the second group (strain K):\n- Recombinant = 4\n- Parental = 40\n- Total = 44\nRecombination rate r = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%\n\nThis indicates a very high degree of recombination. None of the answer choices reflect such a high value, which makes me think I might have misunderstood the problem.\n\nPerhaps the question asks for the percentage of each mutation within the population rather than the recombination itself. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the level of integration in terms of plasmids, not recombination.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Given that the recombination rate appears to be around 90%, which isn't among the options, I suspect there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of each mutation in the population, not recombination. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are percentages like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 5%. Since my calculated recombination rates are over 90%, none of these options fit. Perhaps the question intended to ask about the frequency of each mutation, not recombination.\n\nLooking back, the problem states: \"determine the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, the closest would be H. 5 percent, but I thought the recombination was over 90%. Alternatively, perhaps the actual recombination is lower, and the confusion arises from the experimental design.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to interpret this is that when both phages are present, the E. coli strain B shows significant recombination, as seen through the increased number of plumes on strain B compared to strain K. The exact calculation might involve comparing the frequency of the mutations in the offspring.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are partially linked, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the equation:\n\nr = (q1 * q2) / p1 * p2\n\nBut without knowing the allele frequencies, it's tricky. Alternatively, the percentage of recombinant plumes can be approximated.\n\nFrom the first group (strain B):\n- Recombinant plumes = 40\n- Total plumes = 44\n- Recombinant frequency = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nFrom the second group (strain K):\n- Recombinant plumes = 4\n- Total plumes = 44\n- Recombinant frequency = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%\n\nSince the lysogenic phage integrates more efficiently against strain K, the recombination frequency is highest against that strain, which aligns with the higher recombinant frequency (90.9%).\n\nHowever, the answer options don't include anything close to 90%. The closest is option H (5%) and G (0.5%). This discrepancy suggests that either the interpretation is incorrect, or I've made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of each mutation within the population, not recombination. For example, if in the population, 1% have the lysogenic phage mutation and 5% have the wild-type, then the recombination would depend on their interaction.\n\nBut given the ambiguity and the provided options, I think the intended answer might be H. 5 percent, assuming that the recombination rate is lower than expected, possibly due to experimental factors or a misunderstanding in the experiment's design.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

In phages, especially T_4, different mutants might recombine to produce more efficient phages. If two mutants recombine, the resulting phage would have better activity, maybe even lysogenic if one was lysogenic and the other was not. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutants are present, the bacteria respond differently depending on where you plate them. On strain B's lawn, only the lysogenic phage worked, meaning that the non-lytic phage didn't cause issues. However, on strain K's lawn, which is presumably resistant to the non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes, while the non-lycic one caused fewer. This suggests that the non-lytic phage is somehow interacting with the lysogenic phage.\n\nIn such experiments, the number of recombinations is often estimated using the formula r = (n1 + n2 - n3)/N, where n1 and n2 are the counts under each condition, n3 is the count in the control group, and N is the total population. Wait, no, actually, for reciprocal plating, the formula is r = (n1 * n2 - n3)/(n1 + n2), but I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, when both mutants are present, the number of recombinations can be estimated as (n1 + n2 - n3)/N, where n1 and n2 are the number of successful plating on each strain, and n3 is the number in the control (which isn't mentioned here).\n\nBut let me think again. In this case, the non-lycic phage is causing issues on K, so perhaps it's combining with the lysic phage. Each mutation has a certain probability of being recombined. If two mutations are present, the probability of recombination is p, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on p.\n\nWait, another approach is the equation for the number of recombinant offspring, which is (p)^2 * N, but since we're dealing with plating density, it's adjusted accordingly. Maybe the formula used here is n1 + n2 - n3 \u2248 (some function of p). I recall that when you have two strains, the number of recombinants can be approximated by r = (n1 + n2 - n3)/N, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the first scenario, only the lysogenic phage works on strain B, indicating that the non-lytic phage didn't cause any issues on strain B. But on strain K, the non-lytic phage caused 40 plumes, which suggests that it recombined with the lysogenic phage on K. So the number of recombinations would determine how many plumes appeared on K.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes on K, and the non-lycic caused 40 * (probability of recombining once?), wait, no. Actually, when you plate a mixture of two mutants on a strain, the number of plumes depends on whether the mutants can combine. For example, if the lysogenic phage (L) is present and the non-lytic (NL) is present, and they recombine at rate r, then the total phage would have a mix of L and NL, each with their own probabilities.\n\nBut in the experiment, when you plate the lysogenic phage on strain K, which is resistant to the non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage must be combining with the non-lytic phage from the other sample. So the number of plumes observed on K would be proportional to the number of recombination events. Since on strain B, only the lysogenic phage worked, implying that the non-lycic phage didn't recombine on B, suggesting that the non-lycic phage didn't interact with the lysogenic phage on B.\n\nTherefore, the number of recombination events is determined by how much the non-lycic phage interacts with the lysogenic phage. Each recombination event increases the likelihood of the phage being active enough to cause a plume. So the ratio of plumes on K to those on B can give us an idea of the recombination efficiency.\n\nBut the problem states that four plumes were found on K and 40 on B. Assuming that the number of plumes relates to the number of successful interactions (i.e., recombination events), the ratio would suggest that K had four times as many recombination events as B. But since B didn't react to the non-lycic phage, all the plumes on B came from the lysogenic phage itself without recombination.\n\nSo, if the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40, and assuming that these are directly related to the number of recombination events, then the ratio is 1:10. That suggests that each recombination event on K leads to ten times as many plumes as on B. But I'm not sure if this is the right way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes indicates the number of times the phages combined. If the non-lycic phage combines with the lysogenic phage on K, creating a mixed phage that can replicate and replicate further, producing more plumes. So the number of plumes on K would be higher than on B because it's a more efficient phage due to recombination.\n\nGiven that, the increase from 40 on B to 4 on K suggests that the combination led to a decrease in the number of plumes, which contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I got it backward. Perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes on K compared to B. But in this case, on B, the lysogenic phage alone caused 40 plumes, while on K, the non-lycic phage caused 4, which is less. That seems counterintuitive because recombination should make the phage more efficient, reducing the chance of plating.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the experiment works. The non-lycic phage is present in one sample and the lysogenic in the other. When you plate them together, the phages should undergo recombination. The number of plumes on K is lower than on B, which makes sense because the lysogenic phage alone on B produces more plumes due to its ability to lyse and replicate without needing to combine.\n\nBut why is K showing fewer plumes despite the presence of recombination? Because the non-lycic phage is now recombining with the lysogenic phage, making a mixed phage. The original lysogenic phage may not need to recombine because it can lyse and replicate on its own. The non-lycic phage, on the other hand, requires the lysogenic phage to recombine before it can lyse effectively.\n\nSo, the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes because the mixed phage is less likely to lyse and replicate properly. Therefore, the number of plumes on K is lower because the recombination has made the phage less effective. Now, how do we calculate the recombination frequency?\n\nI remember that in such experiments, the number of recombination events can be estimated by the formula:\n\nr = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N\n\nWhere:\n- n1 is the number of successful plating on the first strain,\n- n2 is the number on the second,\n- n3 is the number in the control,\n\nand N is the total number of plating cells.\n\nIn this case, n1 is 40 (lysogenic on K), n2 is 4 (non-lytic on B), and n3 is 0 (since it's a reciprocal experiment). So plugging in:\n\nr = (40 + 4 - 0) / N\n\nBut wait, what's N here? It's the total number of plating cells. If each strain had, say, 100 plating cells, then N would be 200. But since we don't know N, maybe we assume that it's the same for both strains, or that it cancels out. Alternatively, sometimes the formula uses the product of the numbers, like n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the number of plating cells. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombination events can be calculated using the observed plumes. Since K showed fewer plumes, it implies that the recombination reduced the efficiency. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can consider the difference in pluming.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred 1/10th as often on K as on B. If the lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes, and the non-lycic causes 4, the ratio suggests that the recombination event reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. So the recombination frequency would correspond to a 1% change, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another formula I've heard is that the number of recombination events can be estimated by the formula r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N, where n3 is the number in control. Here, n3 is zero. So r = (40 + 4) / N. Without knowing N, it's hard to compute exactly, but perhaps we can approximate.\n\nAssuming that N is large enough that r is small, but given the options are percentages, maybe we can infer that a 1% recombination frequency corresponds to r = 0.01, so plugging back:\n\nr = (44) / N = 0.01 => N=4400. But without knowing N, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / (n1 + n2 + n3), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurs once every 10 plating attempts. So the recombination frequency is 10%, but looking at the options, H is 5%, which is closer. Alternatively, the ratio could mean that the recombination happened once per 100 plating attempts, which is 1%.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting confused here. Another way is to realize that the number of recombination events is proportional to the number of times the two mutations interact. If the lysogenic phage causes 40 plumes on B, and the non-lycic causes 4 on K, then the recombination must have increased the number of plumes on K relative to B, but since it decreased, perhaps the opposite is true.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes on B, meaning that it's the most efficient. The non-lycic phage plus lysogenic phage causes 4 plumes on K, which is less efficient, meaning that the recombination reduced the pluming efficiency. So the recombination event caused the phage to become less efficient, hence fewer plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, perhaps the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10, which suggests that the recombination happened 10% of the time. Looking at the options, G is 1.5%, C is 1.5%. Wait, 10% isn't listed. The closest is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombination events can be estimated using the formula:\n\nr = (n1 + n2 - n3) / (n1 + n2)\n\nHere, n1 = 40 (lysogenic on K), n2 = 4 (non-lytic on B), n3 = 0.\n\nSo r = (40 + 4) / (40 + 4) = 44/44 = 1. But this doesn't seem right because r can't exceed 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N, where N is the total number of plating cells. If we assume that each strain had the same number of plating cells, say 100 each, then N=200. Then r=(40+4)/200=44/200=0.22, which is 22%. But none of the options are close to 22%.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2) / (n1 + n2 + n3). If n3=0, then r=44/(44)=1, which still doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of recombination events is proportional to the number of plumes. Since on K, the number of plumes is 4, and on B, it's 40, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred 10% of the time, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, the recombination frequency is 1%, which is option D.\n\nWait, another possibility: the number of plumes reflects the number of successful recombination events. If on K, the non-lycic phage recombines 10% of the time, then it causes 10% of the potential plumes to occur, thus resulting in 4 plumes (assuming 40 potential plumes). On B, the non-lycic phage recombines 100% of the time, causing 40 plumes. But that doesn't align with the data.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the standard method for calculating recombination frequency in such experiments. Upon recalling, the standard method uses the formula:\n\nr = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the number of successful plating on each strain, and n3 is the number in the control. In this case, n3=0, so r=(40+4)/N.\n\nWithout knowing N, perhaps we can assume that N is the total number of plating cells, which would be the sum of all plating cells from both strains. If each strain had, say, 100 plating cells, then N=200. Thus, r=(44)/200=0.22, which is approximately 22%, but this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10, meaning that the recombination event reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. If each recombination event on K reduces the plume count by a factor of 10, then the recombination frequency would be 1%, which is option D.\n\nThat makes sense because 1% recombination would reduce the plume count by 10x, matching the observed data. So the answer should be D.0.01 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombination events can be calculated using the observed plumes. Since K showed fewer plumes, it implies that the recombination reduced the efficiency. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can consider the difference in pluming.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred 1/10th as often on K as on B. If the lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes, and the non-lycic causes 4, the ratio suggests that the recombination event reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. So the recombination frequency would correspond to a 1% change, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another formula I've heard is that the number of recombination events can be estimated by the formula r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N, where n3 is the number in control. Here, n3 is zero. So r = (40 + 4) / N. Without knowing N, it's hard to compute exactly, but perhaps we can approximate.\n\nAssuming that N is large enough that r is small, but given the options are percentages, maybe we can infer that a 1% recombination frequency corresponds to r = 0.01, so plugging back:\n\nr = (44) / N = 0.01 => N=4400. But without knowing N, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / (n1 + n2 + n3), but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurs once every 10 plating attempts. So the recombination frequency is 10%, but looking at the options, H is 5%, which is closer. Alternatively, the ratio could mean that the recombination happened once per 100 plating attempts, which is 1%.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting confused here. Another way is to realize that the number of recombination events is proportional to the number of times the two mutations interact. If the lysogenic phage causes 40 plumes on B, and the non-lycic causes 4 on K, then the recombination must have increased the number of plumes on K relative to B, but since it decreased, perhaps the opposite is true.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes on B, meaning that it's the most efficient. The non-lycic phage plus lysogenic phage causes 4 plumes on K, which is less efficient, meaning that the recombination reduced the pluming efficiency. So the recombination event caused the phage to become less efficient, hence fewer plumes.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, perhaps the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10, which suggests that the recombination happened 10% of the time. Looking at the options, G is 1.5%, C is 1.5%. Wait, 10% isn't listed. The closest is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombination events can be estimated using the formula:\n\nr = (n1 + n2 - n3) / (n1 + n2)\n\nHere, n1 = 40 (lysogenic on K), n2 = 4 (non-lytic on B), n3 = 0.\n\nSo r = (40 + 4) / (40 + 4) = 44/44 = 1. But this doesn't seem right because r can't exceed 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N, where N is the total number of plating cells. If we assume that each strain had the same number of plating cells, say 100 each, then N=200. Then r=(40+4)/200=44/200=0.22, which is 22%. But none of the options are close to 22%.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is r = (n1 + n2) / (n1 + n2 + n3). If n3=0, then r=44/(44)=1, which still doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of recombination events is proportional to the number of plumes. Since on K, the number of plumes is 4, and on B, it's 40, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the recombination event occurred 10% of the time, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, the recombination frequency is 1%, which is option D.\n\nWait, another possibility: the number of plumes reflects the number of successful recombination events. If on K, the non-lycic phage recombines 10% of the time, then it causes 10% of the potential plumes to occur, thus resulting in 4 plumes (assuming 40 potential plumes). On B, the non-lycic phage recombines 100% of the time, causing 40 plumes. But that doesn't align with the data.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the standard method for calculating recombination frequency in such experiments. Upon recalling, the standard method uses the formula:\n\nr = (n1 + n2 - n3) / N\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the number of successful plating on each strain, and n3 is the number in the control. In this case, n3=0, so r=(40+4)/N.\n\nWithout knowing N, perhaps we can assume that N is the total number of plating cells, which would be the sum of all plating cells from both strains. If each strain had, say, 100 plating cells, then N=200. Thus, r=(44)/200=0.22, which is approximately 22%, but this isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10, meaning that the recombination event reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. If each recombination event on K reduces the plume count by a factor of 10, then the recombination frequency would be 1%, which is option D.\n\nThat makes sense because 1% recombination would reduce the plume count by 10x, matching the observed data. So the answer should be D.0.01 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

I'm trying to recall how these numbers relate to recombination rates. \n\nIn experimental biology, the number of plumes indicates whether the phage type causes a lytic or lysogenic effect. If the phage is lysogenic, it should cause a lytic fission, leading to more plumes because each phage affects multiple cells. Conversely, if it's lysogenic, it might not affect as much? Wait, no\u2014lytic phages would lyse many cells, creating more free-standing phages, hence more plumes. Lysogenic phages cause replication within the cell, so they might not lyse the cell effectively. Hmm, maybe I got that backwards.\n\nBut according to the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phages caused more damage, so they probably lyse the cells. So when you mix the two mutants, the lysogenic phage from strain B would lyse the E. coli, causing more plumes than the lysogenic phage from strain K. However, since the first sample had higher plumes (40 vs. 4), perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B has a different mutation that leads to even greater disruption.\n\nRecombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In phages, this could mean that the two mutations have occurred at different sites along the T4 gene. Recombination frequency (RF) is often measured using double mutants where the two mutations interfere with each other, like in recombinant DNA experiments. RF is usually expressed as a percentage, such as 1%, meaning that 1% of the time, the two mutations don't interfere with each other.\n\nIn this context, the recombination between the two mutations in T4 would determine how effective the combination of lysogenic phages is. If the two mutations are tightly linked (high RF), then mixing them wouldn't create strong double mutants; instead, they might just interact without creating significant disruption. However, if the RF is low (say, 1%), then mixing the two phages would create a double mutant that disrupts the target E. coli more effectively.\n\nLooking back at the data: when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected (40 plumes). This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a certain degree of disruption, while the lysogenic phage from strain K isn't as disruptive. But wait, the dilution factors are different: 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5. Dilution affects how much of the phage is present per cell. A higher dilution factor means fewer phages per cell, which reduces the chance of them interacting or causing significant effects. \n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked (low RF), then mixing them would produce a more effective double mutant, disrupting the target E. coli more. If they're less related, the effect would be less. Since the first sample (strain B with higher dilution) resulted in 40 plumes, and the second sample (strain K with lower dilution) resulted in 4 plumes, it seems like the double mutant is better when the dilutions are higher. That implies that the double mutant is more effective when the phages are more concentrated, which aligns with low RF. Because if they were highly recombined, their effects might cancel each other out, reducing the effectiveness of the double mutant.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for calculating the expected number of plumes. Each plume represents a new phage infection event. If there's complete interference (no recombination), each phage would cause a unique set of events, potentially increasing the number of plumes compared to individual events. However, in reality, the number of plumes depends on the concentration of the phages and their ability to infect cells. \n\nThe observed plume counts suggest that the double mutant is more effective when the phages are more concentrated.

The key point here is that the presence of recombination between the two mutations leads to an increase in the effectiveness of the double mutant.

It should be that the first half is on strain B's lawn, and the second half is on strain K's lawn. So the initial population is split equally: half on strain B's lawn at high dilution, and half on strain K's lawn at lower dilution. Then each is plated again. \n\nThe number of plumes on each lawn depends on how many times the phage has replicated before lysis. If the mutation allows replication (lysogenic), then more plumes would form as the phage replicates during growth. If it doesn't allow replication (lytic), fewer plumes might form because the phage dies immediately upon replication. \n\nIn the case where only lysogenic phages infect strain B, you'd expect more plumes than if only lytic ones did. But since the initial infection caused only strain B to be affected, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B is interacting with the lytic phage from strain K? Or maybe it's about whether the mutations are in different regions affecting each type differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to a situation where only one strain can handle both mutations effectively, leading to higher expression. But wait, the data shows that the lysogenic phage (from strain B) isn't affected, while the lytic phage (from strain K) is. That suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate, so it doesn't cause lysis, hence doesn't affect strain B. But the lytic phage does replicate and lyses the cell, so it affects strain B. \n\nBut why is the other half (on strain K) affected more? Because when you plate on strain K's lawn, you have the same number of cells as strain B, right? Unless the DNA damage changes the susceptibility or growth rate. Maybe the combination of both mutations causes some sort of double-strand break or other defect that increases replication rates or something else. \n\nWait, let me think in terms of the experiment. The first half is on strain B's lawn at high dilution (1:10^7), meaning the concentration is very low. Since the phage is lysogenic, it shouldn't lyse the cells because it doesn't replicate. So you wouldn't get any plumes on strain B's lawn. But the second half is on strain K's lawn at lower dilution (1:10^5), meaning even less phage around. However, the lytic phage from strain K will replicate and lyse the cells, causing plumes. But here, we saw 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which contradicts my earlier thought because if it's on strain B's lawn, the phage shouldn't be lysogenic. Wait, no\u2014maybe I got it wrong. \n\nLet me clarify: the first half is on strain B's lawn, so any plumes would come from phages that can replicate and lyse strain B's cells. The second half is on strain K's lawn, so any plumes would come from phages that can replicate and lyse strain K's cells. But the data shows 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which implies that these plumes are from phages that can lyse strain B. That makes sense because those phages are lysogenic. But wait, if all the phages in the first half are lysogenic, they shouldn't contribute to the plumes on strain B's lawn. Therefore, perhaps the initial division was such that half of the phages are lysogenic (only on strain B's lawn) and half are lytic (only on strain K's lawn). But the problem states that both types are present, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the experiment involved two independent sets of phages: one set is lysogenic (only infecting strain B) and another set is lytic (only infecting strain K). They are mixed together. When they grow, the mixture may lead to some double-strand breaks or other issues. Alternatively, the presence of both mutations might cause some kind of interference where the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently because of the lytic phage's replication, leading to reduced replication efficiency. This could increase the likelihood of double-strand breaks, increasing plasmid replication rates beyond normal, thereby allowing more plumes. \n\nAnother angle is considering the double strand break (DSB) repair mechanism. If the phage carries a mutation that disrupts DSB repair, it might replicate faster. In the context of the experiment, perhaps the lysogenic phage (from strain B) doesn't replicate well due to the lytic phage (from strain K) interfering with its replication, leading to less replication and thus fewer plumes. Conversely, the lytic phage (from strain K) replicates and causes more plumes. \n\nBut according to the data, on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, and on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the other half is plated on strain K, which resulted in 4 plumes, and the first half (strain B) had 40 plumes. Wait, but if the first half is on strain B's lawn, then the plumes should come from lysogenic phages, which don't replicate, so why did you get 40 plumes on strain B's lawn? That seems contradictory. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Perhaps the first half is on strain B's lawn, and the second half is on strain K's lawn, but both are plated with the same number of cells. So when you plate on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phages (which can only infect strain B) won't cause lysis because their replication is prevented by the lack of lysogenic phage to prevent replication. Therefore, you wouldn't get any plumes on strain B's lawn. But the problem reports 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which suggests otherwise. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when you plate on strain B's lawn, the cells are susceptible to the lysogenic phage, so the plumes come from phages that can lyse strain B's cells. But if the lysogenic phage is not replicating, then why would it cause plumes? Oh, I see now. If the lysogenic phage can replicate without any protection against it, it would cause plumes. But in reality, lysogenic phages require a prophage to protect themselves from replication. If the phage isn't protected, it can replicate and lyse the cells. So if the lysogenic phage isn't replicated properly (due to the lytic phage from strain K interfering), then it can't lyse strain B's cells, resulting in no plumes. But the data shows 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which indicates that the lysogenic phage did replicate and lyse, causing plumes. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently. The problem mentions that the lytic phage from strain K causes more plumes (4) compared to the lysogenic phage from strain B (40). So the presence of the lytic phage from strain K is making more plumes, suggesting that it's more effective at replicating and causing lysis. Now, when both types are present, the effect on the other strain depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. \n\nPerhaps the interaction between the two mutants leads to some kind of competition for replication sites. If the lysogenic phage from strain B is trying to replicate but the lytic phage from strain K interferes by preventing it, then the lysogenic phage may have trouble replicating, resulting in fewer plumes. On the other hand, the lytic phage from strain K, being unaffected by the lysogenic phage (since it doesn't lyse strain B's cells), replicates more quickly and causes more plumes. \n\nSo, when you mix the two types, the lysogenic phage from strain B can't replicate efficiently because the lytic phage from strain K prevents it, leading to fewer plumes. Meanwhile, the lytic phage from strain K doesn't rely on the lysogenic phage to replicate, so it causes more plumes. \n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 40 plumes on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's. So when both types are present, the total plumes are 44. Each half is 44/2 = 22 plumes per half. But in the first half (strain B's lawn), 40 plumes were found, which is almost the entire sample. Wait, that can't be right because the total is 44, and the first half should have 22 plumes. Similarly, the second half (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes, which is much less than 22. \n\nWait, I must have misunderstood the setup. Perhaps each half is treated separately, and then the plumes are combined. So when you plate on strain B's lawn, you get 40 plumes, and when you plate on strain K's lawn, you get 4. Adding them up gives 44 plumes in total, which is expected when both types are present. \n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination between the mutations? Recombination refers to the interaction between the two mutations. If the mutations are in separate regions, they might influence each other's replication. For example, if the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant M1) can replicate better when the lytic phage from strain K (mutant M2) is present, it might reduce the effectiveness of M1 replication. Conversely, M2 replication might be enhanced by the presence of M1. \n\nWhen both M1 and M2 are present, the interactions can change the outcome. If M1 and M2 are in close proximity, they might influence each other's activity. For instance, M1 might be able to replicate more efficiently because M2 is interfering, reducing the overall number of plumes. \n\nTo quantify this, we can use the concept of interference. Interference occurs when one mutation reduces the likelihood of another mutation occurring. In this case, the lytic phage from strain K (M2) might interfere with the replication of the lysogenic phage from strain B (M1). \n\nThe formula for calculating the degree of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = 1 - (1 - r)^n\n\nWhere 'r' is the fraction of cells that exhibit the double mutation, and 'n' is the number of cells. However, in our case, we're dealing with plume counts rather than individual events, so we need a different approach. \n\nInstead, we can use the equation derived from the law of interference:\n\nm = m1 * m2 / (m1 + m2 - m1*m2)\n\nWhere 'm' is the observed mean plume density, 'm1' and 'm2' are the densities expected under normal conditions. Assuming that without either mutation, the plume density remains the same, we can solve for the recombination coefficient 'r'.\n\nGiven:\nm = 4 (plumes on strain B)\nm1 = 40 (plumes on strain B)\nm2 = 4 (plumes on strain K)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because m1 should be the expected plume density when only M1 is present. Actually, when only M1 is present, plumes would come solely from M1, so m1 = 40. Similarly, when only M2 is present, plumes come from M2, so m2 = 4. But when both are present, the observed plumes are a function of both. \n\nUsing the formula:\n\nm = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4 = (40 * 4) / (40 + 4)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4 = 160 / 44 \u2248 3.636\n\nThat's not correct because 4 \u2260 3.636. So perhaps my approach is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, using the standard interference formula for two mutations:\n\nR = 1 - e^{-r}\n\nWhere R is the recombination frequency, and 'r' is the probability of recombination. But I'm not sure if this applies directly here. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If the presence of M2 (lytic phage from K) enhances M1 (lysogenic phage from B) replication, then the plume count for M1 alone should be higher than what it would be without interference. \n\nAssuming that in the absence of M2, the plumes would come solely from M1, so m1 = 40. With M2 present, the plumes decrease because some of M1's replication is hindered. \n\nIf the plumes are reduced by a factor equal to the interference, say 0.8, then m1_with_m2 = m1_without_m2 * 0.8 = 40 * 0.8 = 32. But in reality, the observed plumes on strain B's lawn are 40, which includes both M1 and M2. So this line of reasoning might not be helpful.\n\nPerhaps I should look for an equation that relates the observed plume count (m) to the expected plume counts (m1 and m2) and the recombination coefficient (r). \n\nAccording to the law of interference, the observed mean plume density (m) when both mutations are present is given by:\n\nm = (m1 + m2 - m1*m2)/(m1 + m2)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the exact formula. The correct formula for the expectation when two mutations interfere is:\n\nm = m1 + m2 - (m1*m2)/k\n\nWhere k is the inhibition coefficient, representing the reduction in replication caused by the second mutation. However, without knowing k, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, assuming that the presence of M2 reduces the likelihood of M1 replication by a certain factor, say 'e'. Then, the expected plumes from M1 alone would be m1 = m1_without_m2 * e. \n\nIn our case, m1_without_m2 = 40 (plumes on strain B's lawn without any interference). When M2 is present, the plumes on strain B's lawn would be m1_with_m2 = 40 * e. Similarly, without M1, the plumes on strain K's lawn would be m2_without_m1 = 4 * e. But when both are present, the plumes on strain B's lawn would include both M1 and M2. \n\nHowever, this still doesn't give us enough information to solve for 'e' or 'r'. \n\nMaybe instead, we can assume that the recombination coefficient 'r' is the probability that the two mutations occur in the same region, leading to interference. The observed plume count can then be related to 'r' through a formula involving exponentials. \n\nFor example, the probability of seeing both mutations is:\n\nP = e^{-r}\n\nAnd the observed plume count is proportional to P. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nGiven the options provided (from 0.01% to 0.5%), and considering that the presence of the lytic phage from strain K significantly increases the plume count on strain B's lawn, indicating a strong positive correlation between the two mutations, the recombination coefficient 'r' should be relatively high. \n\nLooking at the options, the highest value is F. 0.5%, followed by E. 0.2%, etc. Based on the significant enhancement of plumes on strain B's lawn when both mutations are present, it suggests a moderate level of recombination. \n\nTherefore, choosing option F (0.5%) seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, no, actually, it says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that. It should be that the first half is on strain B's lawn, and the second half is on strain K's lawn. So the initial population is split equally: half on strain B's lawn at high dilution, and half on strain K's lawn at lower dilution. Then each is plated again. \n\nThe number of plumes on each lawn depends on how many times the phage has replicated before lysis. If the mutation allows replication (lysogenic), then more plumes would form as the phage replicates during growth. If it doesn't allow replication (lytic), fewer plumes might form because the phage dies immediately upon replication. \n\nIn the case where only lysogenic phages infect strain B, you'd expect more plumes than if only lytic ones did. But since the initial infection caused only strain B to be affected, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B is interacting with the lytic phage from strain K? Or maybe it's about whether the mutations are in different regions affecting each type differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to a situation where only one strain can handle both mutations effectively, leading to higher expression. But wait, the data shows that the lysogenic phage (from strain B) isn't affected, while the lytic phage (from strain K) is. That suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate, so it doesn't cause lysis, hence doesn't affect strain B. But the lytic phage does replicate and lyses the cell, so it affects strain B. \n\nBut why is the other half (on strain K) affected more? Because when you plate on strain K's lawn, you have the same number of cells as strain B, right? Unless the DNA damage changes the susceptibility or growth rate. Maybe the combination of both mutations causes some sort of double-strand break or other defect that increases replication rates or something else. \n\nWait, let me think in terms of the experiment. The first half is on strain B's lawn at high dilution (1:10^7), meaning the concentration is very low. Since the phage is lysogenic, it shouldn't lyse the cells because it doesn't replicate. So you wouldn't get any plumes on strain B's lawn. But the second half is on strain K's lawn at lower dilution (1:10^5), meaning even less phage around. However, the lytic phage from strain K will replicate and lyse the cells, causing plumes. But here, we saw 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which contradicts my earlier thought because if it's on strain B's lawn, the phage shouldn't be lysogenic. Wait, no\u2014maybe I got it wrong. \n\nLet me clarify: the first half is on strain B's lawn, so any plumes would come from phages that can replicate and lyse strain B's cells. The second half is on strain K's lawn, so any plumes would come from phages that can replicate and lyse strain K's cells. But the data shows 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which implies that these plumes are from phages that can lyse strain B. That makes sense because those phages are lysogenic. But wait, if all the phages in the first half are lysogenic, they shouldn't contribute to the plumes on strain B's lawn. Therefore, perhaps the initial division was such that half of the phages are lysogenic (only on strain B's lawn) and half are lytic (only on strain K's lawn). But the problem states that both types are present, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the experiment involved two independent sets of phages: one set is lysogenic (only infecting strain B) and another set is lytic (only infecting strain K). They are mixed together. When they grow, the mixture may lead to some double-strand breaks or other issues. Alternatively, the presence of both mutations might cause some kind of interference where the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently because of the lytic phage's replication, leading to reduced replication efficiency. This could increase the likelihood of double-strand breaks, increasing plasmid replication rates beyond normal, thereby allowing more plumes. \n\nAnother angle is considering the double strand break (DSB) repair mechanism. If the phage carries a mutation that disrupts DSB repair, it might replicate faster. In the context of the experiment, perhaps the lysogenic phage (from strain B) doesn't replicate well due to the lytic phage (from strain K) interfering with its replication, leading to less replication and thus fewer plumes. Conversely, the lytic phage (from strain K) replicates and causes more plumes. \n\nBut according to the data, on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, and on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the other half is plated on strain K, which resulted in 4 plumes, and the first half (strain B) had 40 plumes. Wait, but if the first half is on strain B's lawn, then the plumes should come from lysogenic phages, which don't replicate, so why did you get 40 plumes on strain B's lawn? That seems contradictory. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Perhaps the first half is on strain B's lawn, and the second half is on strain K's lawn, but both are plated with the same number of cells. So when you plate on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phages (which can only infect strain B) won't cause lysis because their replication is prevented by the lack of lysogenic phage to prevent replication. Therefore, you wouldn't get any plumes on strain B's lawn. But the problem reports 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which suggests otherwise. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when you plate on strain B's lawn, the cells are susceptible to the lysogenic phage, so the plumes come from phages that can lyse strain B's cells. But if the lysogenic phage is not replicating, then why would it cause plumes? Oh, I see now. If the lysogenic phage can replicate without any protection against it, it would cause plumes. But in reality, lysogenic phages require a prophage to protect themselves from replication. If the phage isn't protected, it can replicate and lyse the cells. So if the lysogenic phage isn't replicated properly (due to the lytic phage from strain K interfering), then it can't lyse strain B's cells, resulting in no plumes. But the data shows 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, which indicates that the lysogenic phage did replicate and lyse, causing plumes. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently. The problem mentions that the lytic phage from strain K causes more plumes (4) compared to the lysogenic phage from strain B (40). So the presence of the lytic phage from strain K is making more plumes, suggesting that it's more effective at replicating and causing lysis. Now, when both types are present, the effect on the other strain depends on whether they interfere with each other's replication. \n\nPerhaps the interaction between the two mutants leads to some kind of competition for replication sites. If the lysogenic phage from strain B is trying to replicate but the lytic phage from strain K interferes by preventing it, then the lysogenic phage may have trouble replicating, resulting in fewer plumes. On the other hand, the lytic phage from strain K, being unaffected by the lysogenic phage (since it doesn't lyse strain B's cells), replicates more quickly and causes more plumes. \n\nSo, when you mix the two types, the lysogenic phage from strain B can't replicate efficiently because the lytic phage from strain K prevents it, leading to fewer plumes. Meanwhile, the lytic phage from strain K doesn't rely on the lysogenic phage to replicate, so it causes more plumes. \n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 40 plumes on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's. So when both types are present, the total plumes are 44. Each half is 44/2 = 22 plumes per half. But in the first half (strain B's lawn), 40 plumes were found, which is almost the entire sample. Wait, that can't be right because the total is 44, and the first half should have 22 plumes. Similarly, the second half (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes, which is much less than 22. \n\nWait, I must have misunderstood the setup. Perhaps each half is treated separately, and then the plumes are combined. So when you plate on strain B's lawn, you get 40 plumes, and when you plate on strain K's lawn, you get 4. Adding them up gives 44 plumes in total, which is expected when both types are present. \n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination between the mutations? Recombination refers to the interaction between the two mutations. If the mutations are in separate regions, they might influence each other's replication. For example, if the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant M1) can replicate better when the lytic phage from strain K (mutant M2) is present, it might reduce the effectiveness of M1 replication. Conversely, M2 replication might be enhanced by the presence of M1. \n\nWhen both M1 and M2 are present, the interactions can change the outcome. If M1 and M2 are in close proximity, they might influence each other's activity. For instance, M1 might be able to replicate more efficiently because M2 is interfering, reducing the overall number of plumes. \n\nTo quantify this, we can use the concept of interference. Interference occurs when one mutation reduces the likelihood of another mutation occurring. In this case, the lytic phage from strain K (M2) might interfere with the replication of the lysogenic phage from strain B (M1). \n\nThe formula for calculating the degree of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = 1 - (1 - r)^n\n\nWhere 'r' is the fraction of cells that exhibit the double mutation, and 'n' is the number of cells. However, in our case, we're dealing with plume counts rather than individual events, so we need a different approach. \n\nInstead, we can use the equation derived from the law of interference:\n\nm = m1 * m2 / (m1 + m2 - m1*m2)\n\nWhere 'm' is the observed mean plume density, 'm1' and 'm2' are the densities expected under normal conditions. Assuming that without either mutation, the plume density remains the same, we can solve for the recombination coefficient 'r'.\n\nGiven:\nm = 4 (plumes on strain B)\nm1 = 40 (plumes on strain B)\nm2 = 4 (plumes on strain K)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because m1 should be the expected plume density when only M1 is present. Actually, when only M1 is present, plumes would come solely from M1, so m1 = 40. Similarly, when only M2 is present, plumes come from M2, so m2 = 4. But when both are present, the observed plumes are a function of both. \n\nUsing the formula:\n\nm = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4 = (40 * 4) / (40 + 4)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4 = 160 / 44 \u2248 3.636\n\nThat's not correct because 4 \u2260 3.636. So perhaps my approach is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, using the standard interference formula for two mutations:\n\nR = 1 - e^{-r}\n\nWhere R is the recombination frequency, and 'r' is the probability of recombination. But I'm not sure if this applies directly here. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If the presence of M2 (lytic phage from K) enhances M1 (lysogenic phage from B) replication, then the plume count for M1 alone should be higher than what it would be without interference. \n\nAssuming that in the absence of M2, the plumes would come solely from M1, so m1 = 40. With M2 present, the plumes decrease because some of M1's replication is hindered. \n\nIf the plumes are reduced by a factor equal to the interference, say 0.8, then m1_with_m2 = m1_without_m2 * 0.8 = 40 * 0.8 = 32. But in reality, the observed plumes on strain B's lawn are 40, which includes both M1 and M2. So this line of reasoning might not be helpful.\n\nPerhaps I should look for an equation that relates the observed plume count (m) to the expected plume counts (m1 and m2) and the recombination coefficient (r). \n\nAccording to the law of interference, the observed mean plume density (m) when both mutations are present is given by:\n\nm = (m1 + m2 - m1*m2)/(m1 + m2)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the exact formula. The correct formula for the expectation when two mutations interfere is:\n\nm = m1 + m2 - (m1*m2)/k\n\nWhere k is the inhibition coefficient, representing the reduction in replication caused by the second mutation. However, without knowing k, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, assuming that the presence of M2 reduces the likelihood of M1 replication by a certain factor, say 'e'. Then, the expected plumes from M1 alone would be m1 = m1_without_m2 * e. \n\nIn our case, m1_without_m2 = 40 (plumes on strain B's lawn without any interference). When M2 is present, the plumes on strain B's lawn would be m1_with_m2 = 40 * e. Similarly, without M1, the plumes on strain K's lawn would be m2_without_m1 = 4 * e. But when both are present, the plumes on strain B's lawn would include both M1 and M2. \n\nHowever, this still doesn't give us enough information to solve for 'e' or 'r'. \n\nMaybe instead, we can assume that the recombination coefficient 'r' is the probability that the two mutations occur in the same region, leading to interference. The observed plume count can then be related to 'r' through a formula involving exponentials. \n\nFor example, the probability of seeing both mutations is:\n\nP = e^{-r}\n\nAnd the observed plume count is proportional to P.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, I remember that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two strands of DNA. In phages, particularly T_4, this would mean that the two mutation genes have swapped places within the T4 genome. This allows the phages to recognize each other during replication, either causing them to lyse (if they replicate their own T4) or to integrate their genes into the phage's genome (lysogenic).\n\nThe dilution factors are important here. Diluting the phages more (i.e., adding more buffer) increases the chance of recombination because it reduces the chance that two identical mutations will cause both to replicate without causing issues. If the phages were non-recombinant, we'd expect fewer plumes at higher dilutions because recombination would make them more likely to replicate without causing problems, leading to fewer plumes (since the phages don't lyse cells as much).\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B's lawn, there were 40 plumes. On strain K's lawn, there were only 4 plumes. Since the two strains are different, the lower number on K might indicate that the recombination isn't occurring in the way expected for strain B. Wait, actually, if there was complete recombination, the plume counts should be similar because recombination would allow both mutants to replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes than expected from non-recombined phages. So if K has fewer plumes, maybe the phages there didn't undergo recombination, meaning the original mutations aren't interacting correctly.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in T_4. So perhaps the presence of more plumes on one strain indicates more successful replication without issues, suggesting less recombination. However, the data shows that on strain B, there are more plumes (40 vs. 4 on K), which could suggest that the phages on strain B underwent more recombination because they replicated better (fewer plumes). That would mean the two mutations are not recombining; instead, they're independent.\n\nWait, but the question states that when both types are present, the strain B is mostly affected. That implies some degree of interaction where the lysogenic phage is replicating successfully, while the lytic one isn't. Maybe the recombination occurred in such a way that the phages on strain B are integrating the lysogenic mutation into their T4 genome, allowing them to replicate without causing issues, hence more plumes? Or perhaps the opposite\u2014maybe the lysogenic phage integrates its mutation, making it more effective at replicating without affecting the host, thus creating more plumes where it shouldn't, whereas the lytic phage isn't integrated, causing more damage.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the numbers. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That seems like a significant difference, almost ten times more plumes on strain B. If there was no recombination, the plume density would be around the same because both mutants would replicate without issues. But since there are many more plumes on B, that suggests that the phages on B are replicating successfully more often, possibly because they have a mutation that makes them more efficient at replicating without causing issues, or because they are integrating their mutation effectively.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would lead to increased plume counts because the phages on both strains would replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. If there's no recombination, you'd see more plumes because the phages are failing to replicate properly. The fact that there are fewer plumes on K compared to B suggests that recombination did occur because the phages on B were more likely to replicate without issues, resulting in fewer plumes. But wait, the opposite: if recombination happened, the phages would replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. So if there are more plumes on B, it suggests that the phages on B had some issue, perhaps recombination, allowing them to replicate without problems, which leads to more plumes. But in reality, if the phages have recombined, they should replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, having fewer plumes on K might imply that the phages on K didn't experience recombination, meaning the two mutations are independent.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The presence of more plumes on strain B compared to K suggests that the phages on B are replicating successfully more often, meaning that the mutations didn't recombine. Because when recombination happens, the phages should replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. So if K has fewer plumes, it means that the phages there didn't recombine, implying that the two mutations are independent. Conversely, if there were more plumes on K, that would support recombination because the phages on K weren't replicating well. But according to the data, K has fewer plumes, which supports that recombination hasn't occurred between the two mutations. \n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking about the amount of recombination, not whether it occurred. So even if there's no recombination, we can still calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for calculating recombination frequency is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the total number of offspring would be the sum of plumes on both plates, which is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant offspring would be the plumes on K, which is 4, assuming those on B are non-recombinant and not contributing to recombination. Alternatively, if all plumes on K are recombinants, then 4/44 * 100% \u2248 9.09%, which is close to 10%. However, looking back, the options include 0.05%, which is very low, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the fraction of the time that the two mutations interact, i.e., the proportion of double mutant cells. The formula for recombination frequency is indeed the number of recombinant individuals divided by the total. Here, the total is 44, and the recombinant is 4. So 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which rounds to approximately 10%, but none of the options match exactly. However, considering that the answer choices are fractions of 1%, perhaps I've misapplied the concept.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of plumes per liter. For example, on strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the phages on strain B are replicating more successfully, indicating that the mutations may have been integrated or that the phages on B are more efficient at replicating without issues. But if the phages on B underwent recombination, they would replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, the observed increase in plumes on B compared to K suggests that recombination did not occur, meaning the mutations are independent.\n\nHowever, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If there was no recombination, the recombination frequency would be zero. But if there was partial recombination, the frequency would be small. The given data doesn't directly show the frequency; it shows the distribution of plumes, which relates to how many cells showed recombination. Each recombination event would create a new plume pattern, so the number of plumes can help determine the extent of recombination.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is much lower, it suggests that fewer cells underwent recombination, meaning the recombination frequency is low. Among the options provided, 0.05% and 0.02% are quite low. But I thought earlier that 4/44 is approximately 9%, which isn't an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nLet me reconsider the experimental design. When the phages are plated on strain B's lawn, the majority of the plumes (40 out of 44) are on strain B. This suggests that most of the time, the phages on strain B replicated without issues, meaning no recombination. Conversely, when plated on strain K's lawn, only 4 out of 44 were found, indicating that fewer cells replicated successfully, which would align with recombination occurring. However, the exact number of recombinant cells isn't directly measured; instead, the plume count reflects the likelihood of replication success.\n\nIf the plume count corresponds to the number of successful replications, then the absence of plumes on strain K suggests that recombination didn't happen. Thus, the recombination frequency would be zero. But since zero isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that each recombination event creates a new plume pattern, and the number of such events affects the plume distribution. The more recombination events, the more variations in plume patterns, leading to more plumes on both strains. However, in this case, strain B has more plumes, which might indicate more successful replication, implying less recombination.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to translate the plume counts into a percentage of recombination. Another angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells that experienced recombination. Each recombination event would lead to a specific pattern of plumes. Without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to relate plume counts directly to recombination frequency.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the ratio of plumes on K to the total. 4 plumes on K, 40 on B, total 44. So 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is roughly 10%. But the closest option to 10% isn't available. Looking at the options, 0.05% and 0.02% are too low, and 0.1% is closer to 10% than 100%. However, the actual calculation doesn't fit any of the options perfectly. It's possible that the correct answer is 0.05%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship between plume counts and recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency using plume counts. Upon recalling, the standard method uses the number of recombinant cells (those that have undergone recombination) over the total number of cells. If each recombinant cell produces a unique combination of alleles, the plume counts would reflect this. However, without knowing the exact number of recombinant cells, it's hard to compute the exact frequency. Given the data, the most plausible answer among the options is D. 0.02%, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that if there's no recombination, the plume counts would be equal, but since they're unequal, recombination must have occurred partially. However, the exact value isn't clear from the given information.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two strands of DNA. In phages, particularly T_4, this would mean that the two mutation genes have swapped places within the T4 genome. This allows the phages to recognize each other during replication, either causing them to lyse (if they replicate their own T4) or to integrate their genes into the phage's genome (lysogenic).\n\nThe dilution factors are important here. Diluting the phages more (i.e., adding more buffer) increases the chance of recombination because it reduces the chance that two identical mutations will cause both to replicate without causing issues. If the phages were non-recombinant, we'd expect fewer plumes at higher dilutions because recombination would make them more likely to replicate without causing problems, leading to fewer plumes (since the phages don't lyse cells as much).\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B's lawn, there were 40 plumes. On strain K's lawn, there were only 4 plumes. Since the two strains are different, the lower number on K might indicate that the recombination isn't occurring in the way expected for strain B. Wait, actually, if there was complete recombination, the plume counts should be similar because recombination would allow both mutants to replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes than expected from non-recombined phages. So if K has fewer plumes, maybe the phages there didn't undergo recombination, meaning the original mutations aren't interacting correctly.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in T_4. So perhaps the presence of more plumes on one strain indicates more successful replication without issues, suggesting less recombination. However, the data shows that on strain B, there are more plumes (40 vs. 4 on K), which could suggest that the phages on strain B underwent more recombination because they replicated better (fewer plumes). That would mean the two mutations are not recombining; instead, they're independent.\n\nWait, but the question states that when both types are present, the strain B is mostly affected. That implies some degree of interaction where the lysogenic phage is replicating successfully, while the lytic one isn't. Maybe the recombination occurred in such a way that the phages on strain B are integrating the lysogenic mutation into their T4 genome, allowing them to replicate without causing issues, hence more plumes? Or perhaps the opposite\u2014maybe the lysogenic phage integrates its mutation, making it more effective at replicating without affecting the host, thus creating more plumes where it shouldn't, whereas the lytic phage isn't integrated, causing more damage.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the numbers. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That seems like a significant difference, almost ten times more plumes on strain B. If there was no recombination, the plume density would be around the same because both mutants would replicate without issues. But since there are many more plumes on B, that suggests that the phages on B are replicating successfully more often, possibly because they have a mutation that makes them more efficient at replicating without causing issues, or because they are integrating their mutation effectively.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would lead to increased plume counts because the phages on both strains would replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. If there's no recombination, you'd see more plumes because the phages are failing to replicate properly. The fact that there are fewer plumes on K compared to B suggests that recombination did occur because the phages on B were more likely to replicate without issues, resulting in fewer plumes. But wait, the opposite: if recombination happened, the phages would replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. So if there are more plumes on B, it suggests that the phages on B had some issue, perhaps recombination, allowing them to replicate without problems, which leads to more plumes. But in reality, if the phages have recombined, they should replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, having fewer plumes on K might imply that the phages on K didn't experience recombination, meaning the two mutations are independent.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The presence of more plumes on strain B compared to K suggests that the phages on B are replicating successfully more often, meaning that the mutations didn't recombine. Because when recombination happens, the phages should replicate without issues, leading to fewer plumes. So if K has fewer plumes, it means that the phages there didn't recombine, implying that the two mutations are independent. Conversely, if there were more plumes on K, that would support recombination because the phages on K weren't replicating well. But according to the data, K has fewer plumes, which supports that recombination hasn't occurred between the two mutations. \n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking about the amount of recombination, not whether it occurred. So even if there's no recombination, we can still calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for calculating recombination frequency is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the total number of offspring would be the sum of plumes on both plates, which is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant offspring would be the plumes on K, which is 4, assuming those on B are non-recombinant and not contributing to recombination. Alternatively, if all plumes on K are recombinants, then 4/44 * 100% \u2248 9.09%, which is close to 10%. However, looking back, the options include 0.05%, which is very low, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the fraction of the time that the two mutations interact, i.e., the proportion of double mutant cells. The formula for recombination frequency is indeed the number of recombinant individuals divided by the total. Here, the total is 44, and the recombinant is 4. So 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which rounds to approximately 10%, but none of the options match exactly. However, considering that the answer choices are fractions of 1%, perhaps I've misapplied the concept.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of plumes per liter. For example, on strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the phages on strain B are replicating more successfully, indicating that the mutations may have been integrated or that the phages on B are more efficient at replicating without issues. But if the phages on B underwent recombination, they would replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, the observed increase in plumes on B compared to K suggests that recombination did not occur, meaning the mutations are independent.\n\nHowever, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. If there was no recombination, the recombination frequency would be zero. But if there was partial recombination, the frequency would be small. The given data doesn't directly show the frequency; it shows the distribution of plumes, which relates to how many cells showed recombination. Each recombination event would create a new plume pattern, so the number of plumes can help determine the extent of recombination.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is much lower, it suggests that fewer cells underwent recombination, meaning the recombination frequency is low. Among the options provided, 0.05% and 0.02% are quite low. But I thought earlier that 4/44 is approximately 9%, which isn't an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nLet me reconsider the experimental design. When the phages are plated on strain B's lawn, the majority of the plumes (40 out of 44) are on strain B. This suggests that most of the time, the phages on strain B replicated without issues, meaning no recombination. Conversely, when plated on strain K's lawn, only 4 out of 44 were found, indicating that fewer cells replicated successfully, which would align with recombination occurring. However, the exact number of recombinant cells isn't directly measured; instead, the plume count reflects the likelihood of replication success.\n\nIf the plume count corresponds to the number of successful replications, then the absence of plumes on strain K suggests that recombination didn't happen. Thus, the recombination frequency would be zero. But since zero isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that each recombination event creates a new plume pattern, and the number of such events affects the plume distribution. The more recombination events, the more variations in plume patterns, leading to more plumes on both strains. However, in this case, strain B has more plumes, which might indicate more successful replication, implying less recombination.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to translate the plume counts into a percentage of recombination. Another angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells that experienced recombination. Each recombination event would lead to a specific pattern of plumes. Without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to relate plume counts directly to recombination frequency.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the ratio of plumes on K to the total. 4 plumes on K, 40 on B, total 44. So 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is roughly 10%. But the closest option to 10% isn't available. Looking at the options, 0.05% and 0.02% are too low, and 0.1% is closer to 10% than 100%. However, the actual calculation doesn't fit any of the options perfectly. It's possible that the correct answer is 0.05%, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship between plume counts and recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency using plume counts. Upon recalling, the standard method uses the number of recombinant cells (those that have undergone recombination) over the total number of cells. If each recombinant cell produces a unique combination of alleles, the plume counts would reflect this. However, without knowing the exact number of recombinant cells, it's hard to compute the exact frequency. Given the data, the most plausible answer among the options is D. 0.02%, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that if there's no recombination, the plume counts would be equal, but since they're unequal, recombination must have occurred partially. However, the exact value isn't clear from the given information.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, actually, no\u2014since the phages cause issues, maybe it's about the timing of their replication.",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014since the phages cause issues, maybe it's about the timing of their replication. If the lysogenic phage doesn't die immediately, it might take time to replicate, while the lytic phage dies quickly. So if you have two different replication times, the phages might not interfere as much. But here, the phages are in the same population, so perhaps the recombination affects how often they take turns replicating.\n\nNow, the results say that when the dilution is 1:10^7, only 4 plumes are found on strain B. That means most of the phages didn't replicate enough to kill the bacteria. Similarly, on strain K, only 40 plumes were found, meaning fewer than 40% of the phages replicated enough to affect the bacteria. Wait, but wait, 40 plumes on K? Since the total number of phages would be the same for both strains, if more plumes appeared on K, that suggests that the lysogenic phage was active more often. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. The key here is the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the replication events occurred in the same order for both phages. If they do, then each phage takes over replication roles without interfering. If they don't, then they might interfere, leading to reduced efficiency.\n\nIn the scenario where both phages are present, the presence of one mutation could influence the replication of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage is active, it might allow the replication of the lysogenic phage to occur earlier, preventing the lysogenic phage from taking over too soon. This could lead to less efficient use of resources, but since the phages are in the same population, it depends on how they interleave.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the phages are in high dilution (1:10^7), only 4 plumes are found on strain B. This implies that at lower dilutions, more plumes appeared on B. At higher dilutions, fewer plumes appeared on B. This suggests that at lower concentrations, the lysogenic phage is more effective, possibly due to it being active later, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate before the lysogenic one dies off.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, with lower dilutions, more plumes appeared, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more active early on. At higher dilutions, fewer plumes appeared on K, suggesting that at higher concentrations, the lysogenic phage isn't as effective anymore.\n\nSo, the difference in plume counts between the two halves indicates the relative activity of the phages. The fact that at lower dilutions, more plumes appear on strain B (where the lysogenic phage has been active longer) compared to strain K (where the lysogenic phage has been active more recently) suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active on B, leading to more plumes appearing on B.\n\nBut what's relevant here is the degree of recombination. Recombination would mean that the replication events happen in a different order for the two phages. However, since we're dealing with two mutants, the interference effect determines the likelihood of co-inhibition.\n\nIf the two mutations are perfectly complementary (no recombination), then both phages would inhibit each other entirely. But in reality, they likely have partial recombination, meaning each phage takes over a replication role, reducing the chance of co-inhibition.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can look at the number of plumes observed. The formula for estimating recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of plumes observed / total number of plumes expected)^2 * 100%\n\nHere, the total number of plumes expected would be the sum of plumes observed on both strains, assuming perfect inhibition. However, since only some plumes appeared on each, the RF can be calculated based on the ratio of plumes observed on the more active strain to the total.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability of co-inhibition, which relates to the product of the probabilities of each phage independently causing death.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the probability that the lysogenic phage kills the bacteria, and q as the probability that the lysogenic phage is active enough to replicate. Then, the expected number of plumes would depend on these probabilities.\n\nGiven that at low dilution, more plumes appeared on strain B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active on B, implying that q is higher on B. Conversely, on strain K, q is lower because fewer plumes appeared there.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the following formula derived from the experimental data:\n\nRF = [(plumes on strain B)/(total plumes)]\u00b2 \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere total plumes = plumes on B + plumes on K.\n\nFrom the experiment:\nPlumes on B = 4\nPlumes on K = 40\nTotal plumes = 4 + 40 = 44\n\nSo,\n\nRF = (4/44)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 (0.0909)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 8.26%\n\nHmm, that's around 8%, which isn't among the options provided. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes observed is proportional to the probability of co-inhibition. The expected number of plumes should be (p*q), assuming independent replications. But since the phages are in the same population, perhaps p and q are related through the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother method is to use the formula:\n\n(1 - rf) = (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere rf is the recombination frequency. Solving for rf gives:\n\nrf = 1 - [(1 - p)(1 - q)]\n\nBut I need to find p and q based on the observations.\n\nAt low dilution (high activity):\n\n- Strain B: More plumes \u2192 suggests higher p.\n- Strain K: Fewer plumes \u2192 suggests lower q.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the replication rates. Let's assume that the lysogenic phage is active (replicates) with probability q and the lysogenic phage dies (does not replicate) with probability 1-q.\n\nSimilarly, the lysogenic phage is active on strain B and K, respectively.\n\nThe number of plumes would reflect the co-inhibition caused by the combination of the two phages' replication attempts.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is active more on strain B, it's more likely to replicate, thus causing more plumes on B. Conversely, on K, the lysogeny is active less, so fewer plumes.\n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities p and q, which relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. It's more about the product of probabilities.\n\nBut given the numbers, let's try another angle. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of co-inhibitory events. Each plume represents a case where both phages successfully replicated and killed the bacteria.\n\nAssuming that the plumes are directly proportional to the probability of co-inhibition, which is (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes can be modeled as N = (1 - r)*P, where P is the probability of co-inhibition without recombination. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes, which is (1 - r) * P, where P is the probability of co-inhibition without any interference.\n\nBut without knowing P, it's tricky. Alternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate rf using the formula:\n\nrf = [ (p + q - 2pq) ] ?\n\nNo, that seems off. Let me think again.\n\nEach plume represents a successful co-inhibition event. The number of such events is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage successfully replicating and killing the bacteria.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- The probability that the lysogenic phage (L) replicates and kills the bacterium is L_replicate.\n- The probability that the lysogenic phage is active enough to replicate is L_active.\n\nThen, the probability of co-inhibition (both L replicating and killing) is L_replicate * L_active.\n\nHowever, the actual occurrence is influenced by recombination. If there's complete recombination (rf=1), then L_active = 0, so co-inhibition is impossible, resulting in zero plumes. If there's no recombination (rf=0), then L_active = 1, and co-inhibition occurs fully, giving maximum plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, some plumes appeared on both strains, indicating that some co-inhibition happened, but not all.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: at low dilution, more plumes on B (strain B has higher activity of L), and fewer on K. This suggests that at lower dilutions, the lysogenic phage is more active on B, increasing the likelihood of co-inhibition, hence more plumes on B.\n\nAt higher dilutions, fewer plumes on both strains suggest that the lysogenic phages aren't as active anymore, possibly due to reduced competition or decreased availability of the other phage.\n\nNow, to estimate rf, we can use the formula:\n\nrf = [ (number of plumes on B) / (number of plumes on B + number of plumes on K) ) ]\u00b2 \u00d7 100%\n\nWhich is similar to the initial approach.\n\nUsing the numbers:\n\nNumber of plumes on B = 4\nNumber of plumes on K = 40\nTotal = 44\n\nSo,\n\nrf = (4/44)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 (0.0909)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 0.0826 \u00d7 100% \u2248 8.26%\n\nThis is approximately 8%, which isn't an option provided. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, but that's much lower. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check the experiment details. It says that when the phages are plated on B, the majority is affected, and on K, only 40 plumes. So at low dilution, more plumes on B, fewer on K.\n\nPerhaps the calculation should involve the ratios of plumes. Maybe it's not just the squares, but another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nrf = [ (plumes on B) / (plumes on B + plumes on K) ) ] \u00d7 100%\n\nBut that would give (4/44)*100%\u22489%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the formula is:\n\n rf = (plumes on B) / (plumes on B + plumes on K) )\n\nWhich would be 4/(4+40)=4/44\u22489%, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reciprocal: 40/(4+40)=90%. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the efficiency of co-inhibition. The number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage replicating and killing. So, let's define:\n\np = probability that lysogenic phage L1 replicates and kills.\n\nq = probability that lysogenic phage L2 replicates and kills.\n\nBut if they are perfectly complementary, then L2 is active when L1 is inactive, and vice versa. The probability of co-inhibition would be p*q*(1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if they are perfectly complementary, there's no overlap (r=0), so co-inhibition is full, p*q. If they are recombined (r>0), then co-inhibition reduces to p*q*(1 - r).\n\nBut in our case, we observe some plumes, so co-inhibition did occur.\n\nWe can write:\n\nplumes_on_B = p * q * (1 - r)\nplumes_on_K = p * q * (1 - r)\n\nWait, but that would imply that plumes_on_B equals plumes_on_K, which isn't the case. So perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on B, the lysogenic phage is more active, so its replication rate is higher. On K, it's less active.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nplumes_on_B = (q_B) * (1 - r) * p\nplumes_on_K = (q_K) * (1 - r) * p\n\nWhere q_B and q_K are the probabilities that the respective lysogenic phages are active.\n\nThen, the ratio of plumes would be:\n\nplumes_on_B / plumes_on_K = q_B / q_K\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nplumes_on_B = 4\nplumes_on_K = 40\nRatio = 4/40 = 0.1\n\nThus,\n\nq_B / q_K = 0.1\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage on B is more active (higher q_B) than on K (lower q_K). From the experimental results, q_B > q_K.\n\nNow, the recombination frequency r is defined as the fraction of cases where the two phages interfere with each other. In this context, r is the proportion of co-inhibitory events that are prevented by recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula is needed. The standard formula relating plume counts to recombination frequency is:\n\nrf = ( (plumes_on_B) / (plumes_on_B + plumes_on_K) ) * 100%\n\nWhich is similar to before. Using the numbers:\n\nrf \u2248 (4 / 44) * 100% \u2248 9%\n\nStill not matching any options. The closest is F. 0.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. The problem states that the two mutants are present simultaneously, and the results show half is plated on B and half on K. Wait, no\u2014the description says \"the resultingly sateis divided in half.\" Wait, no\u2014it says, \"the resultingly sateis divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the division is into two groups: one group is treated with the first type of mutant, and another group is treated with the second type, but this isn't clear. Or perhaps the initial division splits the sample into two, each part being treated with one mutant and then split further.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to plate a mixture of both mutants, but no\u2014the problem says two types of mutant phages are present simultaneously. So, when you plate them together, they may interact, causing some plumes to appear on both strains.\n\nBut regardless, the experiment is that half of the mixed culture is treated with mutant phage X (which is lysogenic) and the other half with mutant Y (also lysogenic), and then each is tested separately against their respective bacterial strains.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, when you plate a mix of both mutants, some plumes will appear on both strains because of interference. Then, half of those samples are treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y.\n\nWait, now that complicates things. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\n\"A plate of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly sateis divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B. Determine the amount of recombination between the two mutationsin this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nSo, initially, a mixed culture of both mutant phages is plated on E. coli strain B. This creates some interactions, producing plumes on both strains. These are then split into two halves: one half is treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y. The number of plumes on each half is counted.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial treatment includes both mutants, but upon mixing, some plumes appear on both strains. Then, half of these are treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y.\n\nBut without more clarity, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial division is into two, each half being treated with one mutant. So, one half is treated with mutant X, the other with mutant Y.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency comes into play when the two phages interact during replication. The more recombination, the less co-inhibition occurs, leading to more plumes.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes increases with higher recombination frequency. So, when recombination is high, more plumes appear on both strains.\n\nGiven that, the formula for rf is:\n\nrf = ( (plumes_on_B) / (plumes_on_B + plumes_on_K) ) \u00d7 100%\n\nAs before, this gives approximately 9%, which isn't an option. Perhaps I'm missing something in the experimental design.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the dilution factors. The first plating is at 1:10^7, and the second at 1:10^5. The interaction between these dilutions determines the effectiveness of each phage's replication.\n\nWhen the phages are in different dilutions, their interactions become less significant. However, when they are at the same dilution, their interference becomes more pronounced.\n\nGiven that, the plumes on B are more numerous because the phages are more active, which aligns with the idea that higher dilution leads to higher plumes count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should account for the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of co-inhibition, which is (1 - r) multiplied by the individual probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nplumes = (1 - r) * p * q\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of each phage individually causing co-inhibition.\n\nAssuming that when the two phages are in the same strain, there's no recombination (r=0), so plumes = p * q.\n\nWhen they are recombined (r>0), plumes = (1 - r) * p * q.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that p_B * (1 - r) = 0.1 * p_K * (1 - r).\n\nAssuming p_K = p_B (same probability for each phage), then 1 = 0.1, which isn't possible.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014since the phages cause issues, maybe it's about the timing of their replication. If the lysogenic phage doesn't die immediately, it might take time to replicate, while the lytic phage dies quickly. So if you have two different replication times, the phages might not interfere as much. But here, the phages are in the same population, so perhaps the recombination affects how often they take turns replicating.\n\nNow, the results say that when the dilution is 1:10^7, only 4 plumes are found on strain B. That means most of the phages didn't replicate enough to kill the bacteria. Similarly, on strain K, only 40 plumes were found, meaning fewer than 40% of the phages replicated enough to affect the bacteria. Wait, but wait, 40 plumes on K? Since the total number of phages would be the same for both strains, if more plumes appeared on K, that suggests that the lysogenic phage was active more often. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. The key here is the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the replication events occurred in the same order for both phages. If they do, then each phage takes over replication roles without interfering. If they don't, then they might interfere, leading to reduced efficiency.\n\nIn the scenario where both phages are present, the presence of one mutation could influence the replication of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage is active, it might allow the replication of the lysogenic phage to occur earlier, preventing the lysogenic phage from taking over too soon. This could lead to less efficient use of resources, but since the phages are in the same population, it depends on how they interleave.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the phages are in high dilution (1:10^7), only 4 plumes are found on strain B. This implies that at lower dilutions, more plumes appeared on B. At higher dilutions, fewer plumes appeared on B. This suggests that at lower concentrations, the lysogenic phage is more effective, possibly due to it being active later, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate before the lysogenic one dies off.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, with lower dilutions, more plumes appeared, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more active early on. At higher dilutions, fewer plumes appeared on K, suggesting that at higher concentrations, the lysogenic phage isn't as effective anymore.\n\nSo, the difference in plume counts between the two halves indicates the relative activity of the phages. The fact that at lower dilutions, more plumes appear on strain B (where the lysogenic phage has been active longer) compared to strain K (where the lysogenic phage has been active more recently) suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active on B, leading to more plumes appearing on B.\n\nBut what's relevant here is the degree of recombination. Recombination would mean that the replication events happen in a different order for the two phages. However, since we're dealing with two mutants, the interference effect determines the likelihood of co-inhibition.\n\nIf the two mutations are perfectly complementary (no recombination), then both phages would inhibit each other entirely. But in reality, they likely have partial recombination, meaning each phage takes over a replication role, reducing the chance of co-inhibition.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can look at the number of plumes observed. The formula for estimating recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of plumes observed / total number of plumes expected)^2 * 100%\n\nHere, the total number of plumes expected would be the sum of plumes observed on both strains, assuming perfect inhibition. However, since only some plumes appeared on each, the RF can be calculated based on the ratio of plumes observed on the more active strain to the total.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability of co-inhibition, which relates to the product of the probabilities of each phage independently causing death.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the probability that the lysogenic phage kills the bacteria, and q as the probability that the lysogenic phage is active enough to replicate. Then, the expected number of plumes would depend on these probabilities.\n\nGiven that at low dilution, more plumes appeared on strain B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active on B, implying that q is higher on B. Conversely, on strain K, q is lower because fewer plumes appeared there.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the following formula derived from the experimental data:\n\nRF = [(plumes on strain B)/(total plumes)]\u00b2 \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere total plumes = plumes on B + plumes on K.\n\nFrom the experiment:\nPlumes on B = 4\nPlumes on K = 40\nTotal plumes = 4 + 40 = 44\n\nSo,\n\nRF = (4/44)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 (0.0909)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 8.26%\n\nHmm, that's around 8%, which isn't among the options provided. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes observed is proportional to the probability of co-inhibition. The expected number of plumes should be (p*q), assuming independent replications. But since the phages are in the same population, perhaps p and q are related through the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother method is to use the formula:\n\n(1 - rf) = (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere rf is the recombination frequency. Solving for rf gives:\n\nrf = 1 - [(1 - p)(1 - q)]\n\nBut I need to find p and q based on the observations.\n\nAt low dilution (high activity):\n\n- Strain B: More plumes \u2192 suggests higher p.\n- Strain K: Fewer plumes \u2192 suggests lower q.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the replication rates. Let's assume that the lysogenic phage is active (replicates) with probability q and the lysogenic phage dies (does not replicate) with probability 1-q.\n\nSimilarly, the lysogenic phage is active on strain B and K, respectively.\n\nThe number of plumes would reflect the co-inhibition caused by the combination of the two phages' replication attempts.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is active more on strain B, it's more likely to replicate, thus causing more plumes on B. Conversely, on K, the lysogeny is active less, so fewer plumes.\n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities p and q, which relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. It's more about the product of probabilities.\n\nBut given the numbers, let's try another angle. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of co-inhibitory events. Each plume represents a case where both phages successfully replicated and killed the bacteria.\n\nAssuming that the plumes are directly proportional to the probability of co-inhibition, which is (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes can be modeled as N = (1 - r)*P, where P is the probability of co-inhibition without recombination. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to use the formula for the expected number of plumes, which is (1 - r) * P, where P is the probability of co-inhibition without any interference.\n\nBut without knowing P, it's tricky. Alternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate rf using the formula:\n\nrf = [ (p + q - 2pq) ] ?\n\nNo, that seems off. Let me think again.\n\nEach plume represents a successful co-inhibition event. The number of such events is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage successfully replicating and killing the bacteria.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- The probability that the lysogenic phage (L) replicates and kills the bacterium is L_replicate.\n- The probability that the lysogenic phage is active enough to replicate is L_active.\n\nThen, the probability of co-inhibition (both L replicating and killing) is L_replicate * L_active.\n\nHowever, the actual occurrence is influenced by recombination. If there's complete recombination (rf=1), then L_active = 0, so co-inhibition is impossible, resulting in zero plumes. If there's no recombination (rf=0), then L_active = 1, and co-inhibition occurs fully, giving maximum plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, some plumes appeared on both strains, indicating that some co-inhibition happened, but not all.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: at low dilution, more plumes on B (strain B has higher activity of L), and fewer on K. This suggests that at lower dilutions, the lysogenic phage is more active on B, increasing the likelihood of co-inhibition, hence more plumes on B.\n\nAt higher dilutions, fewer plumes on both strains suggest that the lysogenic phages aren't as active anymore, possibly due to reduced competition or decreased availability of the other phage.\n\nNow, to estimate rf, we can use the formula:\n\nrf = [ (number of plumes on B) / (number of plumes on B + number of plumes on K) ) ]\u00b2 \u00d7 100%\n\nWhich is similar to the initial approach.\n\nUsing the numbers:\n\nNumber of plumes on B = 4\nNumber of plumes on K = 40\nTotal = 44\n\nSo,\n\nrf = (4/44)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 (0.0909)\u00b2 \u00d7 100% \u2248 0.0826 \u00d7 100% \u2248 8.26%\n\nThis is approximately 8%, which isn't an option provided. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, but that's much lower. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check the experiment details. It says that when the phages are plated on B, the majority is affected, and on K, only 40 plumes. So at low dilution, more plumes on B, fewer on K.\n\nPerhaps the calculation should involve the ratios of plumes. Maybe it's not just the squares, but another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nrf = [ (plumes on B) / (plumes on B + plumes on K) ) ] \u00d7 100%\n\nBut that would give (4/44)*100%\u22489%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the formula is:\n\n rf = (plumes on B) / (plumes on B + plumes on K) )\n\nWhich would be 4/(4+40)=4/44\u22489%, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reciprocal: 40/(4+40)=90%. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the efficiency of co-inhibition. The number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage replicating and killing. So, let's define:\n\np = probability that lysogenic phage L1 replicates and kills.\n\nq = probability that lysogenic phage L2 replicates and kills.\n\nBut if they are perfectly complementary, then L2 is active when L1 is inactive, and vice versa. The probability of co-inhibition would be p*q*(1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if they are perfectly complementary, there's no overlap (r=0), so co-inhibition is full, p*q. If they are recombined (r>0), then co-inhibition reduces to p*q*(1 - r).\n\nBut in our case, we observe some plumes, so co-inhibition did occur.\n\nWe can write:\n\nplumes_on_B = p * q * (1 - r)\nplumes_on_K = p * q * (1 - r)\n\nWait, but that would imply that plumes_on_B equals plumes_on_K, which isn't the case. So perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on B, the lysogenic phage is more active, so its replication rate is higher. On K, it's less active.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nplumes_on_B = (q_B) * (1 - r) * p\nplumes_on_K = (q_K) * (1 - r) * p\n\nWhere q_B and q_K are the probabilities that the respective lysogenic phages are active.\n\nThen, the ratio of plumes would be:\n\nplumes_on_B / plumes_on_K = q_B / q_K\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nplumes_on_B = 4\nplumes_on_K = 40\nRatio = 4/40 = 0.1\n\nThus,\n\nq_B / q_K = 0.1\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage on B is more active (higher q_B) than on K (lower q_K). From the experimental results, q_B > q_K.\n\nNow, the recombination frequency r is defined as the fraction of cases where the two phages interfere with each other. In this context, r is the proportion of co-inhibitory events that are prevented by recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula is needed. The standard formula relating plume counts to recombination frequency is:\n\nrf = ( (plumes_on_B) / (plumes_on_B + plumes_on_K) ) * 100%\n\nWhich is similar to before. Using the numbers:\n\nrf \u2248 (4 / 44) * 100% \u2248 9%\n\nStill not matching any options. The closest is F. 0.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. The problem states that the two mutants are present simultaneously, and the results show half is plated on B and half on K. Wait, no\u2014the description says \"the resultingly sateis divided in half.\" Wait, no\u2014it says, \"the resultingly sateis divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the division is into two groups: one group is treated with the first type of mutant, and another group is treated with the second type, but this isn't clear. Or perhaps the initial division splits the sample into two, each part being treated with one mutant and then split further.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to plate a mixture of both mutants, but no\u2014the problem says two types of mutant phages are present simultaneously. So, when you plate them together, they may interact, causing some plumes to appear on both strains.\n\nBut regardless, the experiment is that half of the mixed culture is treated with mutant phage X (which is lysogenic) and the other half with mutant Y (also lysogenic), and then each is tested separately against their respective bacterial strains.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, when you plate a mix of both mutants, some plumes will appear on both strains because of interference. Then, half of those samples are treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y.\n\nWait, now that complicates things. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\n\"A plate of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly sateis divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B. Determine the amount of recombination between the two mutationsin this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nSo, initially, a mixed culture of both mutant phages is plated on E. coli strain B. This creates some interactions, producing plumes on both strains. These are then split into two halves: one half is treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y. The number of plumes on each half is counted.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial treatment includes both mutants, but upon mixing, some plumes appear on both strains. Then, half of these are treated with mutant X, and the other half with mutant Y.\n\nBut without more clarity, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial division is into two, each half being treated with one mutant. So, one half is treated with mutant X, the other with mutant Y.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency comes into play when the two phages interact during replication. The more recombination, the less co-inhibition occurs, leading to more plumes.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes increases with higher recombination frequency. So, when recombination is high, more plumes appear on both strains.\n\nGiven that, the formula for rf is:\n\nrf = ( (plumes_on_B) / (plumes_on_B + plumes_on_K) ) \u00d7 100%\n\nAs before, this gives approximately 9%, which isn't an option. Perhaps I'm missing something in the experimental design.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the dilution factors. The first plating is at 1:10^7, and the second at 1:10^5. The interaction between these dilutions determines the effectiveness of each phage's replication.\n\nWhen the phages are in different dilutions, their interactions become less significant. However, when they are at the same dilution, their interference becomes more pronounced.\n\nGiven that, the plumes on B are more numerous because the phages are more active, which aligns with the idea that higher dilution leads to higher plumes count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should account for the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of co-inhibition, which is (1 - r) multiplied by the individual probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nplumes = (1 - r) * p * q\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of each phage individually causing co-inhibition.\n\nAssuming that when the two phages are in the same strain, there's no recombination (r=0), so plumes = p * q.\n\nWhen they are recombined (r>0), plumes = (1 - r) * p * q.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 4/40 = 0.1, which suggests that p_B * (1 - r) = 0.1 * p_K * (1 - r).\n\nAssuming p_K = p_B (same probability for each phage), then 1 = 0.1, which isn't possible.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

    "chunk_resampled": "Hmm, so if the two mutations recombine, then the lysogenic phage would cause an issue when it interacts with the lytic phage.",
    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so if the two mutations recombine, then the lysogenic phage would cause an issue when it interacts with the lytic phage. In the first half, dilution is high (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells per well, so less chance of seeing multiple plumes due to dilution. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, which seems like a lot considering the low dilution. On strain K, there are only 4 plumes, indicating more dilution since it's plated on a higher dilution. That might suggest that the lysogenic phage from strain B is interacting with the lytic phage in the second half, leading to more plumes on strain B's lawn. \n\nWait, no, actually, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage should still cause issues because it's part of the same phage type. So if both are present, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to cause any effect because it's already lysogenic. Or maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that the lysogenic phage causes the strain B to be affected, but not strain K. So when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B is affected, but when only lytic phage is present, strain K is unaffected. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strains are probably being affected by the interaction of these phages, causing more mutations. But in this case, the experiment shows that when both are present, some of the E. coli in the B culture have been lysed, while those in K haven't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is somehow causing a mutation in the lytic phage in the K culture, but wait, no, the phages themselves don't mutate; their host DNA changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to more mutations in the E. coli. But according to the results, half the bacteria in each culture show different numbers of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with the lytic phage, that could lead to double mutants, but the experiment isn't showing that directly. Instead, it's showing that when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture has more plumes (40 vs. 4), implying more mutations. However, the K culture has fewer plumes (4 vs. 40?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Then four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So perhaps when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture are more affected (more plumes), while those in K are less affected (fewer plumes). That makes sense because the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so when both are present, more plumes are seen on the B lawn, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is contributing to the mutation in the B strain, but when only the lytic phage is present, the E. coli are unaffected (only 4 on K, meaning the lytic phage didn't cause mutations).\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination of the two mutations? Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, leading to new combinations. In phages, this often means that the lysogenic and lytic phages interact, causing the host's gene structure to change. The number of plumes observed depends on the degree of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture have more plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations in the E. coli. Since the lytic phage alone doesn't affect E. coli strain K, this suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with the lytic phage in such a way that it induces mutations in the host. The degree of interaction or recombination can be inferred from the difference in plume counts between the two groups (B and K).\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent, we'd expect similar plume counts because neither would affect the other. However, since the B group has more plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is more likely to induce mutations in the E. coli, possibly through recombination with the lytic phage.\n\nThe formula for calculating the number of recombinant offspring in a dihybrid cross is:\n\nNumber of recombinants = N \u00d7 (p \u00d7 q + r \u00d7 s)\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of each chromosome segment, and r and s are the probabilities of the other segments. But in this context, it's simpler to use:\n\nRecombination frequency (%) = [ (number of recombinant individuals / total number) \u00d7 100 ]\n\nHowever, in our case, we're dealing with the proportion of plumes caused by the interaction. Each plume represents a mutation event. The ratio of plumes on B to K indicates the relative contribution of each phage type.\n\nGiven that half of the bacteria are plated on B and half on K, but the results are split further into two groups: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. It's possible that the interaction leads to some plumes on B and none on K, but according to the data, only 4 on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, no, actually, when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture are affected (40 plumes), and those in K are not (4 plumes). So the difference in plume counts reflects the effect of the interaction between the two phages.\n\nTo estimate the recombination rate, we can compare the expected plume distribution under complete independence versus under recombination. Under complete independence, we'd expect equal plumes on both groups, but here, B has more plumes than K. Assuming that the lysogenic phage from B is the one causing mutations, the plumes on B indicate that the interaction is significant.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is much more effective at inducing mutations in the host compared to the lytic phage. To quantify this, we can calculate the probability of recombination needed to achieve this ratio.\n\nAssuming that each plume corresponds to a unit of recombination, the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the recombination rate. The relationship between the recombination frequency and the number of plumes can be approximated as follows:\n\nRecombinant plumes = Total plumes \u00d7 Recombination frequency\n\nBut in this case, the difference is not straightforward because the total plumes are distributed differently between the two groups.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the interaction leads to a certain fraction of the plumes appearing on the B group. The ratio of 40 to 4 suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is responsible for about 80% of the mutations. If the recombination rate is high enough to cause 80% of the plumes on B, this could imply a significant level of recombination.\n\nTo find the exact percentage, let's assume that the recombination occurs at a rate 'r'. The expected number of recombinants in a dihybrid cross is given by:\n\nExpected recombinants = (n \u00d7 p \u00d7 q \u00d7 r \u00d7 s) \u00d7 100\n\nBut without knowing n, p, q, r, s, it's tricky. Alternatively, we can model the situation as follows:\n\nEach plume represents a mutation event. The lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations in the host, and the lytic phage from K is not affecting the host. Therefore, the interaction between the two phages causes the mutation in the host, leading to plumes on the B group.\n\nThe number of plumes on B is proportional to the number of interactions between the lysogenic phage from B and the lytic phage from K. If the recombination rate is 'r', then the number of interactions increases with r.\n\nFrom the data, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which is 10:1. Assuming that each lysogenic phage from B contributes to more plumes, we can set up the equation:\n\n(100% + r \u00d7 100%) : (100% - r \u00d7 100%) = 40 : 4\n\nThis assumes that the lysogenic phage from B can either fully contribute (100%) or partially contribute (r \u00d7 100%). Solving for r gives us the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote x as the percentage of plumes contributed by full recombination:\nx = (100 + r)/2\nand y = (100 - r)/2\n\nAccording to the ratio:\ny/x = 4/40 = 1/10\n\nSo,\n[(100 - r)/2] / [(100 + r)/2] = 1/10\nSimplify:\n(100 - r)/(100 + r) = 1/10\nCross-multiply:\n10(100 - r) = 1(100 + r)\n1000 - 10r = 100 + r\nBring terms together:\n-10r - r = 100 - 1000\n-11r = -900\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n11r = 900\nr \u2248 900 / 11 \u2248 81.8%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the options provided go up to 5%. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nPerhaps another approach: If the lysogenic phage from B causes mutations in the host, and the lytic phage from K doesn't affect the host, then the interaction leads to more plumes on the B group. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage from B is contributing significantly more plumes.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate 'r' affects the plume count, and the expected plume count on B is proportional to (100 + r)/2 * total plumes, and on K it's proportional to (100 - r)/2 * total plumes. Given that the total plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, the ratio is 10:1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(100 + r)/2 : (100 - r)/2 = 40 : 4 = 10 : 1\n\nSo,\n\n(100 + r)/ (100 - r) = 10/1\n100 + r = 10(100 - r)\n100 + r = 1000 - 10r\nAdd 10r to both sides and subtract 100:\n11r = 900\nr = 900 / 11 \u2248 81.8%\n\nAgain, this is over 80%, which contradicts the answer choices. Perhaps the assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the recombination rate 'r' relates to the difference in plume counts. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the ratio would reflect that. For example, if 80% of the mutations are due to recombination, then the plumes on B would be higher.\n\nBut looking back at the data, the lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations, leading to more plumes on B. The exact calculation needs to be done carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nPlume count on B = Plume count due to lysogenic phage from B\nPlume count on K = Plume count due to lytic phage from K\n\nThe difference is 40 vs. 4, which is a factor of 10 increase. Assuming that the lysogenic phage from B contributes 10 times more plumes than the lytic phage from K, we can write:\n\n(Plume_B) = 10 \u00d7 (Plume_K)\n\nWhich implies that the lysogenic phage from B is causing 10 times more mutations than the lytic phage from K.\n\nNow, assuming that the recombination rate 'r' is the proportion of mutations caused by interaction, the expected number of mutations would be influenced by 'r'.\n\nIf the recombination rate is 'r', then the expected number of mutations is proportional to 'r'. Therefore, if the lysogenic phage from B causes 10 times more mutations than the lytic phage from K, then 'r' must account for this difference.\n\nMathematically,\n\nMutations from B = r \u00d7 (total mutations)\nMutations from K = (1 - r) \u00d7 (total mutations)\n\nGiven that Mutions from B = 10 \u00d7 Mutions from K,\n\nr \u00d7 (total mutations) = 10 \u00d7 (1 - r) \u00d7 (total mutations)\n\nCancel out (total mutations):\n\nr = 10(1 - r)\nr = 10 - 10r\nAdd 10r to both sides:\n\n11r = 10\nr = 10 / 11 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%\n\nAgain, this suggests a very high recombination rate, which isn't among the answer choices. The closest option is D (0.1%), but that's way too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the concept. The recombination frequency is typically expressed as a percentage, but in some contexts, it's used as a fraction. Let me check the possible answers.\n\nThe options are percentages: 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., down to 0.5%. The highest is 5%.\n\nLooking back at my calculations, I got approximately 90.9%, which is not among the options. This suggests that my initial assumption about the relationship between the plume counts and the recombination rate may be flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead of a simple ratio, I need to consider the actual probability of recombination required to produce the observed plume distribution. Let's denote 'r' as the probability of recombination. If the lysogenic phage from B is involved in recombining with the lytic phage from K, then the expected number of plumes would depend on 'r'.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage from B can either fully recombine (100%) or not (0%), the expected number of plumes would be proportional to 'r'. If the lysogenic phage from B causes mutations in the host, the expected number of plumes would be higher when 'r' is higher.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage from B is causing 80% of the mutations (as per the data: 40 vs. 4), the expected 'r' would be 80%, but this is again inconsistent with the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the difference in plume counts is indicative of the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage from B is causing 80% of the mutations, then the plume count difference reflects this. Therefore, the recombination rate 'r' is 80%, which is 80 per 100, or 0.8, but this isn't an option. The closest is F (0.3%).\n\nBut 80% is quite high, and the answer choices don't include anything close. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the recombination rate is the difference between the plume counts divided by the total. So (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, which is 81.8%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the ratio of plumes on B to K and solve for the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the plume count difference would be 80% - 20% = 60%, but this doesn't align with the observed 80% vs. 4%.\n\nI'm stuck here because my calculations keep leading to a recombination rate above 80%, which isn't among the options. Maybe I need to reconsider the experimental design.\n\nWhen both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture have more plumes (40) compared to the K culture (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is more active in causing mutations in the E. coli than the lytic phage from K. The difference in plume counts is 40 vs. 4, which is a 10-fold difference. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the difference would be 80% - 20% = 60%, but this doesn't match the 80% observed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination rate as the difference between the plume counts divided by the sum. So:\n\n(40 - 4) / (40 + 4) = 36 / 44 = 0.818 or 81.8%, which is a high recombination rate. But this is not among the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is calculated based on the ratio of plumes, ignoring the absolute differences. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the plume count difference reflects that. Therefore, the recombination rate is 80%, but this isn't available.\n\nGiven the options, the closest lower bound is F (0.3%), but this seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G (0.5%), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try a different angle. Suppose the recombination rate 'r' determines the number of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the plume count difference would correspond to that. So, the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is contributing 10 times as much as the lytic phage from K. If the recombination rate 'r' is the proportion of mutations caused by interaction, then:\n\n(100 + r)/2 : (100 - r)/2 = 40 : 4 = 10 : 1\n\nAs before, solving this gives r \u2248 81.8%, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since it's a multiple-choice question, I must choose the closest option, even though it's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is calculated as the difference between the plume counts divided by the total, which is 36/",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so if the two mutations recombine, then the lysogenic phage would cause an issue when it interacts with the lytic phage. In the first half, dilution is high (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells per well, so less chance of seeing multiple plumes due to dilution. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, which seems like a lot considering the low dilution. On strain K, there are only 4 plumes, indicating more dilution since it's plated on a higher dilution. That might suggest that the lysogenic phage from strain B is interacting with the lytic phage in the second half, leading to more plumes on strain B's lawn. \n\nWait, no, actually, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage should still cause issues because it's part of the same phage type. So if both are present, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to cause any effect because it's already lysogenic. Or maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that the lysogenic phage causes the strain B to be affected, but not strain K. So when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B is affected, but when only lytic phage is present, strain K is unaffected. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strains are probably being affected by the interaction of these phages, causing more mutations. But in this case, the experiment shows that when both are present, some of the E. coli in the B culture have been lysed, while those in K haven't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is somehow causing a mutation in the lytic phage in the K culture, but wait, no, the phages themselves don't mutate; their host DNA changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to more mutations in the E. coli. But according to the results, half the bacteria in each culture show different numbers of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with the lytic phage, that could lead to double mutants, but the experiment isn't showing that directly. Instead, it's showing that when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture has more plumes (40 vs. 4), implying more mutations. However, the K culture has fewer plumes (4 vs. 40?), which doesn't make sense. Wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Then four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So perhaps when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture are more affected (more plumes), while those in K are less affected (fewer plumes). That makes sense because the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so when both are present, more plumes are seen on the B lawn, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is contributing to the mutation in the B strain, but when only the lytic phage is present, the E. coli are unaffected (only 4 on K, meaning the lytic phage didn't cause mutations).\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination of the two mutations? Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, leading to new combinations. In phages, this often means that the lysogenic and lytic phages interact, causing the host's gene structure to change. The number of plumes observed depends on the degree of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIn this case, the experiment shows that when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture have more plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations in the E. coli. Since the lytic phage alone doesn't affect E. coli strain K, this suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with the lytic phage in such a way that it induces mutations in the host. The degree of interaction or recombination can be inferred from the difference in plume counts between the two groups (B and K).\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent, we'd expect similar plume counts because neither would affect the other. However, since the B group has more plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is more likely to induce mutations in the E. coli, possibly through recombination with the lytic phage.\n\nThe formula for calculating the number of recombinant offspring in a dihybrid cross is:\n\nNumber of recombinants = N \u00d7 (p \u00d7 q + r \u00d7 s)\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of each chromosome segment, and r and s are the probabilities of the other segments. But in this context, it's simpler to use:\n\nRecombination frequency (%) = [ (number of recombinant individuals / total number) \u00d7 100 ]\n\nHowever, in our case, we're dealing with the proportion of plumes caused by the interaction. Each plume represents a mutation event. The ratio of plumes on B to K indicates the relative contribution of each phage type.\n\nGiven that half of the bacteria are plated on B and half on K, but the results are split further into two groups: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. It's possible that the interaction leads to some plumes on B and none on K, but according to the data, only 4 on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, no, actually, when both phages are present, the E. coli in the B culture are affected (40 plumes), and those in K are not (4 plumes). So the difference in plume counts reflects the effect of the interaction between the two phages.\n\nTo estimate the recombination rate, we can compare the expected plume distribution under complete independence versus under recombination. Under complete independence, we'd expect equal plumes on both groups, but here, B has more plumes than K. Assuming that the lysogenic phage from B is the one causing mutations, the plumes on B indicate that the interaction is significant.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is much more effective at inducing mutations in the host compared to the lytic phage. To quantify this, we can calculate the probability of recombination needed to achieve this ratio.\n\nAssuming that each plume corresponds to a unit of recombination, the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the recombination rate. The relationship between the recombination frequency and the number of plumes can be approximated as follows:\n\nRecombinant plumes = Total plumes \u00d7 Recombination frequency\n\nBut in this case, the difference is not straightforward because the total plumes are distributed differently between the two groups.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the interaction leads to a certain fraction of the plumes appearing on the B group. The ratio of 40 to 4 suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is responsible for about 80% of the mutations. If the recombination rate is high enough to cause 80% of the plumes on B, this could imply a significant level of recombination.\n\nTo find the exact percentage, let's assume that the recombination occurs at a rate 'r'. The expected number of recombinants in a dihybrid cross is given by:\n\nExpected recombinants = (n \u00d7 p \u00d7 q \u00d7 r \u00d7 s) \u00d7 100\n\nBut without knowing n, p, q, r, s, it's tricky. Alternatively, we can model the situation as follows:\n\nEach plume represents a mutation event. The lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations in the host, and the lytic phage from K is not affecting the host. Therefore, the interaction between the two phages causes the mutation in the host, leading to plumes on the B group.\n\nThe number of plumes on B is proportional to the number of interactions between the lysogenic phage from B and the lytic phage from K. If the recombination rate is 'r', then the number of interactions increases with r.\n\nFrom the data, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which is 10:1. Assuming that each lysogenic phage from B contributes to more plumes, we can set up the equation:\n\n(100% + r \u00d7 100%) : (100% - r \u00d7 100%) = 40 : 4\n\nThis assumes that the lysogenic phage from B can either fully contribute (100%) or partially contribute (r \u00d7 100%). Solving for r gives us the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote x as the percentage of plumes contributed by full recombination:\nx = (100 + r)/2\nand y = (100 - r)/2\n\nAccording to the ratio:\ny/x = 4/40 = 1/10\n\nSo,\n[(100 - r)/2] / [(100 + r)/2] = 1/10\nSimplify:\n(100 - r)/(100 + r) = 1/10\nCross-multiply:\n10(100 - r) = 1(100 + r)\n1000 - 10r = 100 + r\nBring terms together:\n-10r - r = 100 - 1000\n-11r = -900\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n11r = 900\nr \u2248 900 / 11 \u2248 81.8%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the options provided go up to 5%. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nPerhaps another approach: If the lysogenic phage from B causes mutations in the host, and the lytic phage from K doesn't affect the host, then the interaction leads to more plumes on the B group. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage from B is contributing significantly more plumes.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate 'r' affects the plume count, and the expected plume count on B is proportional to (100 + r)/2 * total plumes, and on K it's proportional to (100 - r)/2 * total plumes. Given that the total plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, the ratio is 10:1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(100 + r)/2 : (100 - r)/2 = 40 : 4 = 10 : 1\n\nSo,\n\n(100 + r)/ (100 - r) = 10/1\n100 + r = 10(100 - r)\n100 + r = 1000 - 10r\nAdd 10r to both sides and subtract 100:\n11r = 900\nr = 900 / 11 \u2248 81.8%\n\nAgain, this is over 80%, which contradicts the answer choices. Perhaps the assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the recombination rate 'r' relates to the difference in plume counts. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the ratio would reflect that. For example, if 80% of the mutations are due to recombination, then the plumes on B would be higher.\n\nBut looking back at the data, the lysogenic phage from B is causing mutations, leading to more plumes on B. The exact calculation needs to be done carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nPlume count on B = Plume count due to lysogenic phage from B\nPlume count on K = Plume count due to lytic phage from K\n\nThe difference is 40 vs. 4, which is a factor of 10 increase. Assuming that the lysogenic phage from B contributes 10 times more plumes than the lytic phage from K, we can write:\n\n(Plume_B) = 10 \u00d7 (Plume_K)\n\nWhich implies that the lysogenic phage from B is causing 10 times more mutations than the lytic phage from K.\n\nNow, assuming that the recombination rate 'r' is the proportion of mutations caused by interaction, the expected number of mutations would be influenced by 'r'.\n\nIf the recombination rate is 'r', then the expected number of mutations is proportional to 'r'. Therefore, if the lysogenic phage from B causes 10 times more mutations than the lytic phage from K, then 'r' must account for this difference.\n\nMathematically,\n\nMutations from B = r \u00d7 (total mutations)\nMutations from K = (1 - r) \u00d7 (total mutations)\n\nGiven that Mutions from B = 10 \u00d7 Mutions from K,\n\nr \u00d7 (total mutations) = 10 \u00d7 (1 - r) \u00d7 (total mutations)\n\nCancel out (total mutations):\n\nr = 10(1 - r)\nr = 10 - 10r\nAdd 10r to both sides:\n\n11r = 10\nr = 10 / 11 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%\n\nAgain, this suggests a very high recombination rate, which isn't among the answer choices.

The closest is F (0.3%).\n\nBut 80% is quite high, and the answer choices don't include anything close. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the recombination rate is the difference between the plume counts divided by the total. So (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, which is 81.8%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the ratio of plumes on B to K and solve for the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage from B causes 80% of the mutations, then the plume count difference would be 80% - 20% = 60%, but this doesn't align with the observed 80% vs. 4%.\n\nI'm stuck here because my calculations keep leading to a recombination rate above 80%, which isn't among the options.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, what do plumes mean?",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, what do plumes mean? Plumes are small circular aggregates of colonies that appear when cells are lysed. So if a phage infects a cell, you get a plume. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B probably infects strain K, causing a plume on strain K's lawn. Conversely, the lysogenic phage from strain K would cause a plume on strain B's lawn. \n\nBut why did the first half have more plumes (40) than the second half (4)? That makes sense because the first half was diluted more (1:10^7), so fewer phages present to cause plumes. The second half had less dilution (1:10^5), meaning more phages available to infect the cells. \n\nNow, I remember that when two phages interfere with each other, their recombination rate affects how often they co-infect a target cell. Recombination means they exchange genetic material, so when they attack the same cell, they either work together (co-domino effect) or oppose each other (domino effect). If they're tightly linked (high recombination), they'll attack the same cell multiple times, leading to higher rates of co-infection. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of plumes at the end of an experiment is:\n\nNumber of plumes = (Total phages in sample)^2 / (Population density of bacteria)\n\nBut since we have different dilutions in the two samples, let's see:\n\nFor the first sample (strain B):\n- Dilution factor: 1/1e7\n- Phage count: Let\u2019s assume N.\n- Cells plated: N * (1/1e7)\n- Expected plumes: (N^2) / (cells * density) \u2248 40\n\nFor the second sample (strain K):\n- Dilution factor: 1/1e5\n- Phage count: M.\n- Cells plated: M * (1/1e5)\n- Expected plumes: (M^2) / (cells * density) \u2248 4\n\nAssuming similar conditions except for dilution, maybe N is larger than M. Let's say N = M + X, where X is the difference due to dilution.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination coefficient. The recombination coefficient (Rc) is calculated using the formula:\n\nRc = (Number of plumes in control sample - Number of plumes in interference sample) / Total possible plumes\n\nWait, no, another way: The observed plumes should be reduced by Rc^2 compared to the expected if they were independent.\n\nLet me think differently. When two phages interfere, the probability that they both infect the same cell is Rc^2. So the expected number of co-infections (plumes) would be proportional to Rc^2.\n\nGiven that the first sample has more plumes (40 vs 4), which aligns with Rc^2 being larger, suggesting a lower Rc (since Rc is the proportion of time they are together).\n\nSo Rc = sqrt(Number of plumes in interference / Number of plumes without interference)\n\nIn our case, without interference, the total plumes would be 40 + 4 = 44. Wait, no\u2014that might not be correct. Actually, if the interference leads to more plumes, it implies that Rc is low because they don't interfere as much.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plumes in interference sample to control gives Rc squared.\n\nSo Rc^2 = 4 / (40 + 4) = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nThus, Rc \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.3\n\nThis means they overlap about 30% of the time. Now, recombination coefficient Rc is related to the number of recombined genes. For T_4 phages, the number of genes involved in recombination is usually 3 (some regions of the T4 gene). The maximum possible recombinant fraction is 1/(2^n), where n is the number of recombined genes. For 3 genes, max is 1/8=12.5%.\n\nIf Rc is 0.3, then the actual recombinant fraction is Rc^2 = 0.09, which corresponds to 9%, but wait, the calculation above gave Rc^2\u22480.0909, which is approximately 9%. However, considering the actual numbers, the observed plumes may differ slightly due to experimental factors. But the options given are up to 0.5%, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula directly. The expected number of plumes when interference occurs is given by (total phages)^2 / (population density * dilution factor). Since both samples are placed in the same culture, their population densities are the same. Let's denote D1 and D2 as the dilution factors (1e7 and 1e5 respectively). Then:\n\nExpected plumes in sample 1 (interference): (N^2)/D1 = 40\nExpected plumes in sample 2 (no interference): (M^2)/D2 = 4\n\nAssuming N = M + x, but since D1 > D2, and N^2/D1 = 40, while M^2/D2 = 4, we can relate them.\n\nLet\u2019s express N as M*(sqrt(D1/D2)))*something. Alternatively, solve for M and N.\n\nFrom sample 1:\nN^2 = 40*D1 = 40*1e7 = 4e8\n\nSample 2:\nM^2 = 4*D2 = 4*1e5 = 4e5\n\nTaking square roots:\nN \u2248 sqrt(4e8) = 63245.55\nM \u2248 sqrt(4e5) = 632.4555\n\nSo M/N \u2248 632.4555 / 63245.55 \u2248 0.01\n\nWhich is 1%, so Rc \u2248 1%\n\nLooking back, the options include F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Wait, my calculation gives Rc \u2248 1%, which isn't among the choices. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate Rc as follows:\n\nThe expected number of plumes when no interference is (N^2)/(D1*N_pop), but I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe formula for the number of plumes when two phages interfere is:\n\nPlumes = (Total phages)^2 / (Population density * (D1 + D2))\n\nBut since we have two samples, perhaps the expectation is additive.\n\nWait, no, actually, when two phages interfere, the probability that both infect the same cell is Rc^2. Therefore, the expected number of plumes should decrease by Rc^2 compared to the non-interfering scenario.\n\nIn our case, the first sample (with D1) has more plumes, indicating that Rc^2 is smaller, so less overlapping.\n\nCalculating Rc^2:\n\nRc^2 = (number of plumes in sample 2) / (number of plumes in sample 1) = 4 / 40 = 0.1\n\nSo Rc = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, which is about 31.6%. But that seems too high because recombination coefficients are usually around 10-20% for most regions.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. If the number of plumes decreases when interference occurs, Rc^2 = (plumes without interference) / (plumes with interference) = 4 / 40 = 0.1. So Rc = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, which is 31.6%, which is way beyond typical values for T4 phages.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach it differently. Perhaps the number of recombination events per phage is important.\n\nEach T4 phage carries several genes involved in recombination. Typically, there are three genes involved. The maximum recombinant fraction is 1/(2^n), where n is the number of genes. For three genes, it's 1/8=12.5%. So if the observed recombination fraction is close to 12.5%, the recombination coefficient Rc would be sqrt(12.5%) \u2248 3.5%. But that's still higher than typical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach. Let's think about the probability of recombination occurring during phage infection. The recombination coefficient R is defined such that the probability of co-infection is R^2.\n\nIn our case, when both phages interfere, the expected number of plumes is reduced by R^2. From the data, without interference, the expected number is 40, but with interference, it's 4. So the reduction is 4/40 = 0.1. Thus, R^2 = 0.1, so R \u2248 0.316, which is about 31.6%. This is very high, exceeding typical values for T4 phages, which usually have a maximum R of ~12.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the exact relationship. The number of plumes caused by phage A attacking phage B is proportional to (n_A * n_B) / (N * D), where N is the population density and D is the dilution factor. But since both samples are in the same culture, N cancels out.\n\nSo for the two samples:\n\nSample 1 (D1=1e7, interference):\nn1^2 / (D1 * N) = 40\n\nSample 2 (D2=1e5, no interference):\nn2^2 / (D2 * N) = 4\n\nDividing Sample 2 by Sample 1:\n\n(n2^2 / D2) / (n1^2 / D1) ) = 4 / 40 = 0.1\n\nSince n2^2 / D2 = (4 * D2) / n2^2 ?\n\nWait, I think I got lost here. Let me write equations properly.\n\nFrom Sample 1:\nn1^2 = 40 * D1 * N\n\nFrom Sample 2:\nn2^2 = 4 * D2 * N\n\nDivide Sample 2 equation by Sample 1:\n(n2^2 / n1^2) = (4 * D2) / (40 * D1) = (4/40)*(D2/D1) = (1/10)*(1e5 / 1e7) = (1/10)*(1/10) = 1/100\n\nThus, n2/n1 = 1/10\n\nTherefore, n2 = n1 /10\n\nBut n1 = sqrt(40 * D1 * N) = sqrt(40 * 1e7 * N)\n\nn2 = sqrt(4 * D2 * N) = sqrt(4 * 1e5 * N)\n\nSubstituting n2 = n1 /10:\n\nsqrt(4 * 1e5 * N) = (1/10) * sqrt(40 * 1e7 * N)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n4 * 1e5 * N = (1/100) * 40 * 1e7 * N\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: 4e5 * N\nRight side: (4e6) * N\n\nBut 4e5 \u2260 4e6, which suggests a mistake. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two phages interfere, the expected number of co-infections (plumes) is proportional to (n1 * n2) / (N * D). Since N cancels out, the ratio becomes (n1 * n2) / (D). Given that D1 and D2 are different, the ratios must balance.\n\nFrom Sample 1 and Sample 2, the expected plumes are 40 and 4 respectively. Assuming the populations are the same, the ratio of plumes is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the product of n1 and n2 is in the same ratio as the dilution factors. Since D1 is 1e7 and D2 is 1e5, the ratio of D1:D2 is 100:1. To maintain the plume ratio of 10:1, the product n1*n2 must also be in a 100:1 ratio. Which it is, since n1^2/D1 = n2^2/D2 => (n1/n2)^2 = D1/D2 => (n1/n2) = sqrt(D1/D2) = sqrt(100/1) = 10.\n\nThus, n1 = 10 * n2. So n1 is ten times n2.\n\nNow, using the plume counts:\n\nFrom Sample 1: n1^2 / D1 = 40 \u2192 (10n2)^2 / 1e7 = 40 \u2192 100n2^2 = 40 * 1e7 \u2192 n2^2 = 4e6 \u2192 n2 = 200\n\nThen n1 = 10 * 200 = 2000\n\nCheck Sample 2: n2^2 / D2 = 200^2 / 1e5 = 4e4 /1e5 = 0.4 \u2192 but Sample 2 expects 4 plumes, so this doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula.\n\nActually, the number of plumes is proportional to (n1 * n2) / (D). So for Sample 1, (2000 * 200) / 1e7 = 400,000 / 1e7 = 0.4, but according to the data, it's 40 plumes. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to adjust. Let me define k as the constant of proportionality, so:\n\nk * (n1 * n2) / D = plumes\n\nFor Sample 1:\nk * (2000 * 200) / 1e7 = 40 \u2192 k * 4e6 /1e7 = k * 0.4 = 40 \u2192 k = 100\n\nFor Sample 2:\nk * (n2^2) / D2 = 4 \u2192 100 * (n2^2) /1e5 = 4 \u2192 n2^2 = (4 *1e5)/100 = 4e3 \u2192 n2 = 20\n\nThen n1 = 10 * n2 = 200\n\nNow check Sample 1:\nk * (200 * 200) /1e7 = 100 * 4e4 /1e7 = 4e6 /1e7 = 0.4, but expected 40. Doesn't match. Something's wrong.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to set up the equations:\n\nFrom Sample 1: (n1^2) / (D1 * N) = 40 \u2192 n1^2 = 40 * D1 * N\n\nFrom Sample 2: (n2^2) / (D2 * N) = 4 \u2192 n2^2 = 4 * D2 * N\n\nDivide Sample 2 by Sample 1:\n\n(n2^2 / n1^2) = (4 * D2) / (40 * D1) \u2192 (n2 / n1)^2 = (D2) / (10 * D1)\n\nGiven D1=1e7, D2=1e5:\n\n(n2 / n1)^2 = 1e5 / (10 *1e7) = 1e5 /1e8 = 1e-3 \u2192 n2 /n1 = sqrt(1e-3)= approx 0.0316\n\nThus, n2 = n1 * 0.0316\n\nNow, n1^2 = 40 * D1 * N \u2192 n1^2 = 40 *1e7 * N \u2192 n1 = sqrt(4e8 * N)\n\nSimilarly, n2^2 =4 * D2 * N \u2192 n2 = sqrt(4e5 * N)\n\nUsing n2 = n1 *0.0316,\n\nsqrt(4e5 * N) = sqrt(4e8 * N) *0.0316\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n4e5 * N = (4e8 * N) * (0.0316)^2 \u2192 4e5 =4e8 *0.0010 (approx 0.001) \u2192 4e5 \u22484e5, which holds true.\n\nSo, now, knowing that n2 = n1 *0.0316, let's find the actual values.\n\nAssume N is such that n1 is integer. Let's take N=1e5 (arbitrary choice):\n\nn1 = sqrt(40 *1e7 *1e5) = sqrt(4e12) = 2e6\n\nn2 = sqrt(4 *1e5 *1e5) = sqrt(4e10) = 2e5\n\nCheck if n2 =n1*0.0316:\n\n2e5 =2e6 *0.0316\u2192 2e5\u22486.32e4\u2192 No, doesn't hold.\n\nThus, scaling N to make it consistent.\n\nWe have:\n\nn1 =2e6\n\nn2=2e5\n\nFrom earlier, n2 =n1 *0.0316 \u2192 2e5=2e6 *0.0316 \u2192 2e5=6.32e4\u2192 Not matching.\n\nThus, my initial assumption is incorrect. It seems that the only way these equations hold is if the product (n1 *n2) relates to the dilution factors appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the expected recombination fraction.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when interference occurs is given by:\n\nE = (n1^2 * n2^2) / (D1 * D2 * N^2)\n\nBut since N is the same, it simplifies to E=(n1^2 n2^2)/(D1 D2)\n\nBut E=40+4=44.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number without interference is:\n\nE0 = (n1^2 n2^2",

Problem: T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII cancause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, what do plumes mean? Plumes are small circular aggregates of colonies that appear when cells are lysed. So if a phage infects a cell, you get a plume. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B probably infects strain K, causing a plume on strain K's lawn. Conversely, the lysogenic phage from strain K would cause a plume on strain B's lawn. \n\nBut why did the first half have more plumes (40) than the second half (4)? That makes sense because the first half was diluted more (1:10^7), so fewer phages present to cause plumes. The second half had less dilution (1:10^5), meaning more phages available to infect the cells. \n\nNow, I remember that when two phages interfere with each other, their recombination rate affects how often they co-infect a target cell. Recombination means they exchange genetic material, so when they attack the same cell, they either work together (co-domino effect) or oppose each other (domino effect). If they're tightly linked (high recombination), they'll attack the same cell multiple times, leading to higher rates of co-infection. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of plumes at the end of an experiment is:\n\nNumber of plumes = (Total phages in sample)^2 / (Population density of bacteria)\n\nBut since we have different dilutions in the two samples, let's see:\n\nFor the first sample (strain B):\n- Dilution factor: 1/1e7\n- Phage count: Let\u2019s assume N.\n- Cells plated: N * (1/1e7)\n- Expected plumes: (N^2) / (cells * density) \u2248 40\n\nFor the second sample (strain K):\n- Dilution factor: 1/1e5\n- Phage count: M.\n- Cells plated: M * (1/1e5)\n- Expected plumes: (M^2) / (cells * density) \u2248 4\n\nAssuming similar conditions except for dilution, maybe N is larger than M. Let's say N = M + X, where X is the difference due to dilution.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination coefficient. The recombination coefficient (Rc) is calculated using the formula:\n\nRc = (Number of plumes in control sample - Number of plumes in interference sample) / Total possible plumes\n\nWait, no, another way: The observed plumes should be reduced by Rc^2 compared to the expected if they were independent.\n\nLet me think differently. When two phages interfere, the probability that they both infect the same cell is Rc^2. So the expected number of co-infections (plumes) would be proportional to Rc^2.\n\nGiven that the first sample has more plumes (40 vs 4), which aligns with Rc^2 being larger, suggesting a lower Rc (since Rc is the proportion of time they are together).\n\nSo Rc = sqrt(Number of plumes in interference / Number of plumes without interference)\n\nIn our case, without interference, the total plumes would be 40 + 4 = 44. Wait, no\u2014that might not be correct. Actually, if the interference leads to more plumes, it implies that Rc is low because they don't interfere as much.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plumes in interference sample to control gives Rc squared.\n\nSo Rc^2 = 4 / (40 + 4) = 4 / 44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nThus, Rc \u2248 sqrt(0.0909) \u2248 0.3\n\nThis means they overlap about 30% of the time. Now, recombination coefficient Rc is related to the number of recombined genes. For T_4 phages, the number of genes involved in recombination is usually 3 (some regions of the T4 gene). The maximum possible recombinant fraction is 1/(2^n), where n is the number of recombined genes. For 3 genes, max is 1/8=12.5%.\n\nIf Rc is 0.3, then the actual recombinant fraction is Rc^2 = 0.09, which corresponds to 9%, but wait, the calculation above gave Rc^2\u22480.0909, which is approximately 9%. However, considering the actual numbers, the observed plumes may differ slightly due to experimental factors. But the options given are up to 0.5%, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula directly. The expected number of plumes when interference occurs is given by (total phages)^2 / (population density * dilution factor). Since both samples are placed in the same culture, their population densities are the same. Let's denote D1 and D2 as the dilution factors (1e7 and 1e5 respectively). Then:\n\nExpected plumes in sample 1 (interference): (N^2)/D1 = 40\nExpected plumes in sample 2 (no interference): (M^2)/D2 = 4\n\nAssuming N = M + x, but since D1 > D2, and N^2/D1 = 40, while M^2/D2 = 4, we can relate them.\n\nLet\u2019s express N as M*(sqrt(D1/D2)))*something. Alternatively, solve for M and N.\n\nFrom sample 1:\nN^2 = 40*D1 = 40*1e7 = 4e8\n\nSample 2:\nM^2 = 4*D2 = 4*1e5 = 4e5\n\nTaking square roots:\nN \u2248 sqrt(4e8) = 63245.55\nM \u2248 sqrt(4e5) = 632.4555\n\nSo M/N \u2248 632.4555 / 63245.55 \u2248 0.01\n\nWhich is 1%, so Rc \u2248 1%\n\nLooking back, the options include F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Wait, my calculation gives Rc \u2248 1%, which isn't among the choices. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate Rc as follows:\n\nThe expected number of plumes when no interference is (N^2)/(D1*N_pop), but I'm getting confused.

This is very high, exceeding typical values for T4 phages, which usually have a maximum R of ~12.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the exact relationship. The number of plumes caused by phage A attacking phage B is proportional to (n_A * n_B) / (N * D), where N is the population density and D is the dilution factor.

Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two phages interfere, the expected number of co-infections (plumes) is proportional to (n1 * n2) / (N * D). Since N cancels out, the ratio becomes (n1 * n2) / (D). Given that D1 and D2 are different, the ratios must balance.\n\nFrom Sample 1 and Sample 2, the expected plumes are 40 and 4 respectively. Assuming the populations are the same, the ratio of plumes is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the product of n1 and n2 is in the same ratio as the dilution factors. Since D1 is 1e7 and D2 is 1e5, the ratio of D1:D2 is 100:1. To maintain the plume ratio of 10:1, the product n1*n2 must also be in a 100:1 ratio. Which it is, since n1^2/D1 = n2^2/D2 => (n1/n2)^2 = D1/D2 => (n1/n2) = sqrt(D1/D2) = sqrt(100/1) = 10.\n\nThus, n1 = 10 * n2. So n1 is ten times n2.\n\nNow, using the plume counts:\n\nFrom Sample 1: n1^2 / D1 = 40 \u2192 (10n2)^2 / 1e7 = 40 \u2192 100n2^2 = 40 * 1e7 \u2192 n2^2 = 4e6 \u2192 n2 = 200\n\nThen n1 = 10 * 200 = 2000\n\nCheck Sample 2: n2^2 / D2 = 200^2 / 1e5 = 4e4 /1e5 = 0.4 \u2192 but Sample 2 expects 4 plumes, so this doesn't add up.

Doesn't match. Something's wrong.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to set up the equations:\n\nFrom Sample 1: (n1^2) / (D1 * N) = 40 \u2192 n1^2 = 40 * D1 * N\n\nFrom Sample 2: (n2^2) / (D2 * N) = 4 \u2192 n2^2 = 4 * D2 * N\n\nDivide Sample 2 by Sample 1:\n\n(n2^2 / n1^2) = (4 * D2) / (40 * D1) \u2192 (n2 / n1)^2 = (D2) / (10 * D1)\n\nGiven D1=1e7, D2=1e5:\n\n(n2 / n1)^2 = 1e5 / (10 *1e7) = 1e5 /1e8 = 1e-3 \u2192 n2 /n1 = sqrt(1e-3)= approx 0.0316\n\nThus, n2 = n1 * 0.0316\n\nNow, n1^2 = 40 * D1 * N \u2192 n1^2 = 40 *1e7 * N \u2192 n1 = sqrt(4e8 * N)\n\nSimilarly, n2^2 =4 * D2 * N \u2192 n2 = sqrt(4e5 * N)\n\nUsing n2 = n1 *0.0316,\n\nsqrt(4e5 * N) = sqrt(4e8 * N) *0.0316\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n4e5 * N = (4e8 * N) * (0.0316)^2 \u2192 4e5 =4e8 *0.0010 (approx 0.001) \u2192 4e5 \u22484e5, which holds true.\n\nSo, now, knowing that n2 = n1 *0.0316, let's find the actual values.\n\nAssume N is such that n1 is integer. Let's take N=1e5 (arbitrary choice):\n\nn1 = sqrt(40 *1e7 *1e5) = sqrt(4e12) = 2e6\n\nn2 = sqrt(4 *1e5 *1e5) = sqrt(4e10) = 2e5\n\nCheck if n2 =n1*0.0316:\n\n2e5 =2e6 *0.0316\u2192 2e5\u22486.32e4\u2192 No, doesn't hold.\n\nThus, scaling N to make it consistent.\n\nWe have:\n\nn1 =2e6\n\nn2=2e5\n\nFrom earlier, n2 =n1 *0.0316 \u2192 2e5=2e6 *0.0316 \u2192 2e5=6.32e4\u2192 Not matching.\n\nThus, my initial assumption is incorrect. It seems that the only way these equations hold is if the product (n1 *n2) relates to the dilution factors appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the expected recombination fraction.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when interference occurs is given by:\n\nE = (n1^2 * n2^2) / (D1 * D2 * N^2)\n\nBut since N is the same, it simplifies to E=(n1^2 n2^2)/(D1 D2)\n\nBut E=40+4=44.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number without interference is:\n\nE0 = (n1^2 n2^2",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so I remember that when two genes interact, especially in recombinant DNA, you get a certain number of recombinant fragments. Each plume represents a recombinant plasmid. The more plumes found, the higher the frequency of recombination. In this case, since more plumes were found on strain K (40 vs. 4), the recombination must be significant. \n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage recombination is:\n\nPercentage = (Number of recombinant plumes \u00d7 100) / (Total number of plumes)\n\nSo here, total plumes are 4 + 40 = 44. Number of recombinant plumes is 40. Wait, actually, no\u2014because each plume corresponds to a single mutation, right? So if the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, any plasmids from that type would not contribute to the lytic fission, whereas the lysogenic phage contributes. But wait, no\u2014if the phage has a mutation causing it to lyse, then those plasmids would lead to more lytic fission. But in this case, both types are present, and only the lysogenic phage causes issues. So maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't have the mutation, while the other type does. \n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that both types are present, and only the lysogenic phage affects E. coli B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to lyse, while the wild-type phage doesn't. But that contradicts the initial description where only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission. Maybe the phages have different mutations, and when both are present, their interactions determine the outcome. \n\nBut back to the experiment. Since only the lysogenic phage affects E. coli B, any plasmids from that type don't cause the issue, meaning those plasmids wouldn't contribute to the lytic fission. Therefore, the lysogenic phage (with the mutation) would lead to the formation of recombinant plasmids when combined with the wild-type phage. \n\nWhen the phages are mixed, the recombinant plasmids would replicate and cause lytic fission, leading to the observed effect. The presence of these plasmids depends on how often they form during replication. If enough recombination occurs, many plasmids will be formed, leading to multiple plumes.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain K was 40 and on strain B was 4. Strain K might have been treated with the lysogenic phage (since it's resistant to the lysogenic phage?), but I'm getting confused now. Alternatively, the treatment on strain K probably introduced the lysogenic phage, leading to its replication and potential recombination with the wild-type phage, resulting in plasmids that lyse E. coli B.\n\nEach plume represents a single copy of a recombinant plasmid. The number of plumes should be proportional to the number of recombinants. However, in reality, plasmids come in pairs, so each plume corresponds to one copy, but sometimes multiple copies may appear due to incomplete replication. But in this case, we're told that the results came from these specific numbers, so we can use the given data directly.\n\nSo, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be proportional to the difference in dilution factors. The first sample was diluted 1:10^7, and the second was 1:10^5. Dilutions are important because higher dilutions mean fewer plasmids per volume, so less chance of forming recombinant plasmids.\n\nThe formula for estimating the number of recombinant plasmids (R) is:\n\nR \u2248 (number of plumes \u00d7 average plasmid count)\n\nBut without knowing the exact counts, we can estimate using the ratio of plumes. Since strain K had 40 plumes and strain B had 4, the ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the interaction caused ten times as many plasmids in strain K compared to strain B. This implies that most of the plasmids are coming from the lysogenic phage, indicating high recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, we consider that each plasmid is a product of two phages: one from each strain. So the number of recombinant plasmids (R) relates to the fraction of time both phages are active. If R is large, the fraction is high, meaning a lot of recombination happened.\n\nThe formula for percentage recombination is:\n\n% Recombination = (R \u00d7 100) / Total possible plasmids\n\nBut since the total possible plasmids depend on the dilution, we can approximate using the plume ratio. However, another approach is to recognize that the number of plumes indicates the number of recombinants relative to the total possible.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes, each plume represents one copy of a recombinant plasmid. The total number of plasmids in the sample would be related to the dilution factor.\n\nLet me think differently. The probability of a plasmid being formed is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. For example, in a 1:10^7 dilution, each sample has about 1e-7 of the plasmid population. Similarly, a 1:10^5 dilution has 1e-5 of the population.\n\nIf we assume that the number of plumes reflects the proportion of recombinant plasmids, then the ratio of plumes (40/4=10) suggests that there are 10 times as many recombinant plasmids in the first sample than in the second. \n\nThis means that most of the plasmids are recombinants, so the recombination rate is high. To find the percentage, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombinant plasmids / (Total plasmids + Recombinant plasmids) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut without exact counts, we can estimate. If the ratio is 10:1, it suggests that 90% of the plasmids are recombinant. However, that's an approximation. \n\nAnother way is to think about the number of plasmids. If the first sample has 40 plumes at 1:10^7 and the second at 1:10^5, the number of plasmids in the first sample is much smaller, so the ratio of plumes to plasmid density gives the number of recombinants.\n\nThe formula for the estimated number of recombinant plasmids is:\n\nR \u2248 (n1 - n2) / (dilution1 + dilution2)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the number of plumes in each dilution, and dilution is the inverse of the dilution factor.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/(10^7 + 10^5) = 36/(10^7 + 1e5)= 36/(1e5*(100 + 0.01))\u224836/(1e7)=0.00036.\n\nThis gives us the fraction of plasmids that are recombinant, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, another method is to use the ratio of plumes to find the recombination rate.\n\nSince the first sample has 40 plumes and the second 4, and the dilution factors are 10^7 and 10^5, respectively, the recombination rate can be approximated by the ratio of plumes multiplied by the dilution ratios.\n\nThe formula for the recombination rate (f) is:\n\nf = (n1 - n2) / (dilution1 * dilution2)\n\nBut I'm not confident about this. Another approach is to use the fact that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor because plasmid numbers increase with the dilution, and the number of plasmids increases with the square root.\n\nSo, plume numbers scale with sqrt(dilution). Therefore, the ratio of plumes squared equals the ratio of dilutions.\n\n(40/4)^2 = (sqrt(10^7)/sqrt(10^5))^2 \u2192 (10)^2 = (10^(7-5)) \u2192 100 = (10^2) \u2192 Correct.\n\nThis confirms that the plume numbers are correctly scaled by the square root of dilutions. Now, to find the recombination frequency, we can relate the plume ratio to the recombination rate.\n\nThe recombination rate (f) is equal to the ratio of plumes in the first sample minus plumes in the second sample, normalized by the dilution factors.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated as:\n\nf = (R1 - R2) / (D1 + D2)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Perhaps a better way is to use the following formula:\n\nf = (R1 - R2) / (D1 + D2)\n\nWhere R1 is the number of plumes in sample 1, R2 in sample 2, and D1, D2 are the dilution factors.\n\nSo f = (40 - 4)/(10^7 + 10^5) = 36/(1e7+1e5)=36/1.01e7\u22483.56e-6.\n\nThat's a very small number, which seems off because the plumes are in excess. Maybe I'm missing a scaling factor.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of recombinant plasmids (R) is approximately equal to the difference in plume counts multiplied by the square root of the dilution factors.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nR \u2248 (R1 - R2) * sqrt(D2/D1)\n\nSo plugging in: (40-4)*sqrt(10^5/10^7)=36*sqrt(1/100)=36*(0.1)=3.6.\n\nThen, the fraction of plasmids that are recombinant is R / (R1 + R2) = 3.6 / (40 + 4)=3.6/44\u22480.0818, which is approximately 8%. That seems more reasonable.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 1.5%, D is 0.1%, etc., but 8% isn't among them. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (R1 - R2) / (D1 + D2)\n\nWhich would give (40-4)/(1e7 +1e5)=36/(1e7 +1e5)=approx 36/1e7\u22480.00036, which is 0.036%, which is close to option E (0.05%).\n\nBut earlier calculation gave around 8%, which doesn't match. I'm getting conflicting results, so I need to clarify.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to compute the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nf = (R1 - R2) / (D1 + D2)\n\nWhich gives 36 / (1e7 +1e5)= ~0.00036, which is 0.036%, so closest to E (0.05%).\n\nBut I thought earlier that the plume ratio indicated a high recombination rate. Maybe I should stick with the calculation.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest is E (0.05%) or maybe F (0.3%). But according to the calculation, it's 0.036%, so E.\n\nHowever, looking back, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated\" into two halves, then one half is 1:10^7 and the other 1:10^5. Then, the test was done on strain K, and four plumes were found. So, perhaps the plume ratio gives the recombination rate directly.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes (40) could correspond to the number of recombinants. If each plume is a recombinant, then 40 plumes represent 40 recombinants. Considering the dilution factors, perhaps the recombination rate is 40 / (1e7 +1e5) = 40 / 1.01e7\u22480.000396, which is 0.0396%, so approximately 0.04%, which rounds to E (0.05%).\n\nTherefore, the answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Suppose each mutation has m breakpoints. Then, the chance that a randomly selected plasmid from the first sample contains both breakpoints (i.e., is recombinant) is m/m_total, where m_total is the total number of breakpoints across all plasmids.

Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency based on plume counts. From what I remember, the formula is:\n\n% Recombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant plasmids) / (Total plasmids + Number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nOr sometimes expressed as:\n\n% = (Number of recombinant plasmids) / (Total plasmids + Number of recombinant plasmids - Number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nHmm, that seems off.

Then, the probability that a plasmid from the first sample (with 1e7 plasmids) has both breakpoints is x/x_total, where x_total is the total number of breakpoints across all plasmids. Similarly, for the second sample.\n\nBut without knowing the actual breakpoints, it's hard to compute. However, the problem states that the two mutations cause different outcomes on the two strains. This suggests that they must interact, i.e., recombine.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes indicates the success of the phage infection. On strain B, most plumes are present (40), suggesting that the lysogenic phage is effective against B but not K. On strain K, only 4 plumes are present, implying the lysogenic phage is ineffective there. This implies that the two mutations must interfere; thus, recombination occurred.\n\nNow, how much interference happened? The fact that the lysogenic phage worked on B but not K suggests that their breakpoints were arranged differently. If the breakpoints were very close together, the lysogenic phage would work better on both. If they're far apart, they would function differently.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, I think the formula used is:\n\n% Recombination Frequency \u2248 (m1 * m2) / (M + m1 + m2)\n\nWhere m1 and m2 are the number of breakpoints in each mutation, and M is the total number of breakpoints across all plasmids.

But without M, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of recombinant plasmids. If the first sample (1e7 plasmids) shows 40 plumes and the second (1e5) shows 4, the ratio suggests that the first sample had more recombinants. Perhaps the number of recombinants is proportional to 1e7 * 40, but this doesn't directly give the percentage.\n\nI think I'm stuck without specific values for m1, m2, etc. Maybe I need to rely on the options provided. The answer choices are percentages ranging from 0.01% to 5%. Given that the result showed significant variation in plume counts, it's likely that there was a noticeable amount of recombination.\n\nConsidering that the initial sample had a much lower dilution, any recombination events would have required selecting a plasmid from the first sample that also had breakpoints in the second sample. Given the low dilution, the chance of such recombinant plasmids being present is low, so the number of recombinants is limited by the dilution and the breakpoint positions.\n\nSince the recombination increased the number of plumes on the first sample (from 40 to 40 vs. 4), it suggests that the lysogenic phage worked less effectively on strain K, possibly because its breakpoints were interfering with those of strain B. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be relatively high to explain this difference.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is 5%, followed by others.

So when you dilute each plating separately, the number of plumes depends on whether the mutation is present in each plating. If a mutation exists in a plating for strain B, it will cause lysis there; similarly for strain K. The total number of plumes observed should reflect how many times each strain was lysed. \n\nLet me break it down. For the first half, which is 1:10^7 dilution, only strain B is being plated. If the mutation is present, then when you dilute it enough, it might still be detected as a plume. However, since only one type of phage is being plated here, any recombination within this group wouldn't affect the outcome because all the phages are the same except for the mutation. Wait, no\u2014the first half has only the lysogenic phage, right? Because the problem says \"mutant phages\" carrying these mutations. So maybe the lysogenic phage is the one causing the issue, while the lytic one isn't. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, the lysogenic phage carries the mutation that makes it lytic, meaning it can replicate inside the E. coli, leading to lysis upon replication. The lytic phage doesn't do that. So when the lysogenic phage is used alone, it causes lysis in E. coli strain B, but not strain K. But when both types are present, both strains might be lysed because the lysogenic phage can now replicate inside both strains. So the initial test probably had only the lysogenic phage, causing strain B to die but not K. Then, they plate the mixture on strain B's lawn, expecting more deaths, but instead, only part of the bacteria dies. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow affecting the presence of the mutation in the E. coli, possibly through recombination or some sort of interaction.\n\nWait, but the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would mean that the two mutations occurred at different sites in the T_4 genome, allowing the phages to interact. If they're recombined, their product would have a mutation that affects both strains, leading to more deaths than expected. \n\nIn the experiment, when they plate the mixture on strain B's lawn, they saw 4 plumes, which means 4 plasmid-free cells died. On strain K's lawn, they saw 40 plumes, meaning 40 plasmid-free cells died. So the total number of plumes indicates the overall efficacy of the mixture. Since they plated half on B and half on K, the ratio of plumes could relate to the probability of recombination occurring. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of plumes when mixing two independent events is N = n1 + n2 - r, where n1 and n2 are the numbers from each plating, and r is the number of plumes due to recombination. Alternatively, since the recombination leads to double lethality, we can use the equation N = n1 + n2 - r, but sometimes it's modeled as N = n1 + n2 - (n1*n2)/N_total, assuming random interaction. However, in this case, it's simpler to consider that the expected number without recombination would be N_expected = n1 + n2 - r, but I might need to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that without recombination, the mixture would kill n1 + n2 cells. But if recombination occurs, then some cells die twice, reducing the total number of plumes. So the observed number of plumes would indicate the efficiency of killing plus the number killed twice. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes are observed on K and 4 on B, let's denote:\n\nTotal plumes = 40 + 4 = 44. This represents the sum of cells killed once and those killed twice.\n\nIf there was no recombination, we'd expect 40 + 4 = 44 plumes (all cells dying once), but actually, we see fewer because some died twice. The difference tells us about recombination. \n\nSo, if there was complete recombination, every cell would die twice, resulting in 88 plumes (44 * 2). But in reality, we have 44 plumes, which is exactly half of the maximum possible (since 44 = (44/2)*2). This suggests that every cell was killed twice, implying that the two mutations are perfectly recombined. Therefore, the probability of recombination is high.\n\nBut wait, the question provides specific percentages and options, so I need to translate the results into a percentage of recombination. \n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes without recombination would be the sum of the two platings, and with recombination, it decreases. The decrease is proportional to the square of the number of platings, as each combination contributes to recombination. \n\nHowever, another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants. The formula for the expected number of recombinants in a double cross is E = n1 * n2 / N, where N is the total number of plating. In this case, N=44, n1=4, n2=40. So E=4*40/44\u22483.64. \n\nThis means that approximately 3.64 cells have undergone recombination. To find the recombination rate, we divide this by the total number of cells plated, which is 44. So 3.64/44\u22480.0827, or about 8.27%. But this doesn't match any of the given options directly. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. Each recombination event doubles the death, so the number of such events would correspond to the number of plumes. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes are on K and 4 on B, totaling 44, and knowing that each recombination event accounts for an additional death, the number of recombinations would be 40 + 4 - 88 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps a better way is to model the probability of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the probability that a cell survives without recombination. Without recombination, all cells die once, so plumes=44. With recombination, some cells die twice, so plumes=44 - x, where x is the number of dead cells twice. We observe 4 plumes on B and 40 on K, which implies that 4 cells survived without recombination, and 40 cells survived with recombination. Wait, that seems off because 4+40=44, but that would imply that all cells died either once or twice. Actually, the count per strain would depend on the number of cells that died. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes reflects the number of cells that died. For strain B, 4 plumes mean 4 cells died without recombination. For strain K, 40 plumes mean 40 cells died with recombination. This adds up to 44 cells, which matches the total number of platings. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for genetic interference, which relates the probability of recombination to the observed interference. The formula is p = 1 - e^{-2x}, where x is the number of recombinants per chromosome. But this might be more complex than needed here.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for crossover frequency, which is the probability that a crossover occurs between two points. In this case, the number of recombination events (x) is related to the number of plating. Since each recombination event reduces the number of plumes, the observed reduction gives us the number of recombines.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Without recombination, plumes=44.\n- With recombination, plumes=40 on K and 4 on B, total 44.\n\nWait, that doesn't change anything. Maybe I need to think differently. The expected number of plumes when there's no recombination is the sum of platings minus the number of recombinants. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the expected number of recombinants R is given by R = n1 * n2 / N, where N is the total number of cells plated. Here, N=88 (44 from each half). So R=4*40/88\u22481.636. \n\nThis means that approximately 1.636 cells underwent recombination. The recombination rate is R/N \u22481.636/88\u22480.0187, or about 1.87%, which rounds to approximately 2%. Looking back at the options, option F is 0.3 percent, but my calculation is around 2%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). But none of the options is exactly 2%. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try again. If R=1.636, then the recombination rate is R/(n1 + n2)=1.636/88\u22480.0187, or 1.87%. None of the options match this exactly. The closest is option C (1.5%) and D (0.1%), but neither is close. Maybe I've misunderstood the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction is calculated as R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). Plugging in n1=4 and n2=40, R=4*40/(4+40)=160/44\u22483.636. This is over 100%, which is impossible, so I must have the formula wrong.\n\nAh, I see! The correct formula for recombination frequency is R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). But since R cannot exceed 1, if n1*n2 > n1+n2, which is often the case, it suggests that all cells experienced recombination. But in our case, n1=4 and n2=40. So R=4*40/(4+40)=160/44\u22483.636, which is greater than 1, indicating that all cells were recombined. That can't be right because the observed plumes don't support that.\n\nMaybe the formula is R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). If R exceeds 1, it suggests perfect recombination. But in our scenario, R=3.636>1, so all cells were recombined. But that contradicts the observation where some cells died twice. So perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative method: The expected number of cells that die twice is equal to the product of the probabilities of recombination at each site. Assuming independence, P(recombine at both sites)=p^2. The number of such cells would be p^2*N, where N is the total number of cells. The total plumes would be N*(1-p^2). \n\nWe know that the total plumes are 44, so 44=N*(1-p^2). Also, the number of plumes without recombination would be N*(1-p), which equals 44 - x, where x is the number of dead cells twice. But without recombination, all cells die once, so x=0. Thus, 44=N*(1-p). From the above, 44=N*(1-p), and 44=N*(1-p^2).\n\nSubtracting the two equations: 0 = N*p^2 - N*p => N*p(p -1)=0. So p=0 or p=1. But p can't be 0 because then all cells would survive. So p=1. That suggests that all cells underwent recombination, which again conflicts with the observed data.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look for another approach. The key point is that the observed number of plumes is lower than expected without recombination, suggesting some degree of recombination. The expected number without recombination is 44 plumes (4+40). The observed number is also 44, which implies that there was no recombination. But that contradicts the fact that some cells died twice, implying recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that without recombination, all cells die once, giving 44 plumes. With recombination, some cells die twice, reducing the number of plumes. So the observed number is less than 44, which aligns with the data: 40 on K and 4 on B, totaling 44. So the recombination reduces the number of plumes by 4. \n\nHow much recombination leads to 4 less plumes? The difference comes from cells that died twice. Each cell that dies twice reduces the total plumes by 1. So if 4 cells died twice, the total plumes would be 44 - 4 = 40. But in the data, K has 40 and B has 4, adding up to 44. So this suggests that 4 cells died twice, which would require 4 recombination events. \n\nNow, the number of recombination events R can be approximated by the formula R = 2 * (number of dead cells twice) / (total number of cells). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, R = 2 * (number of dead cells twice) / (total number of cells). So R=2*4/44\u22480.1818, or ~18.18% of the cells underwent recombination. \n\nLooking at the options, option G is 0.5 percent, and option H is 0.02 percent. Neither is near 18%. So I must be making a mistake somewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is R = (number of recombination events) / (total number of potential recombination sites). If there are two sites, then R can range from 0 to 1. But without knowing the exact number of sites, this approach is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is 44, which is exactly the expected without recombination, it suggests that there was no recombination. But that contradicts the observation that some cells died twice. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the observed number of plumes is 44, which is the same as without recombination, implying no recombination occurred. But that can't be right because the data shows some cells dying twice.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the results. The total number of plumes is 44, which is the same as the expected without recombination. But why does that happen? It could mean that no recombination occurred because all cells died once, so no cells died twice. However, the data shows that 40 plumes appeared on K and 4 on B, which together make 44. If no recombination happened, K would have 44 plumes, but according to the experiment, K had only 4. Similarly, B had 40. So that doesn't add up. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when recombination happens, some cells die twice, which would reduce the total number of plumes. So if there's recombination, the total plumes would be less than 44. But in the experiment, the total plumes are 44, which suggests no recombination. But that's conflicting because the experiment showed that some cells died twice, implying recombination.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. The question asks for the recombination frequency, which is the proportion of cells that have undergone recombination. Given that the total plumes are 44, which is the same as without recombination, it suggests that no recombination occurred. But this contradicts the observation that some cells died twice. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the observed number of plumes is equal to the expected number without recombination, implying that no recombination happened. But the data shows that cells died twice, which would mean that recombination did occur, but the total plumes remain the same. How?\n\nOh! Because the number of plumes counts the number of cells that died, regardless of the number of times they died. So even if cells died twice, they only contribute to the count once. Therefore, the total plumes remain the same as without recombination, which suggests that no recombination occurred. But that's confusing because the experiment showed some cells dying twice.\n\nI think I'm missing something obvious here. The correct answer must be based on the assumption that the recombination causes some cells to die twice, thus reducing the total number of plumes. The observed total is 44, same as without recombination, meaning no recombination occurred. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero. But that's not among the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the highest is G (0.5%) and H (0.02%). None is zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between the plumes and recombination. \n\nAnother perspective: the number of plumes reflects the number of cells that died, regardless of the number of times they died. So if some cells died twice, the total plumes would be less than the number of cells that died once. In this case, the total plumes are 44, which is the same as if no recombination happened. Therefore, no recombination occurred. But that's contradictory to the observation.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that died without recombination plus twice the number that died with recombination. Let me define R as the number of cells that died with recombination. Then:\n\nPlumes without recombination = n1 + n2 - 2R.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The total plumes would be the number of cells that died without recombination plus twice the number that died with recombination. So:\n\nTotal plumes = (n1 - R) + 2R = n1 + R.\n\nSimilarly, for strain B:\n\nTotal plumes = (n2 - R) + 2R = n2 + R.\n\nAdding both:\n\nTotal plumes = n1 + n2 + R = 44 + R.\n\nBut we know the total plumes are 44, so 44 = 44 + R \u21d2 R=0. So no recombination occurred. Again, this suggests zero recombination, which is not among the options.\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination frequency is zero, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the observed number of plumes includes both normal and double lethality, implying full recombination. But according to the calculations, that's not possible without R exceeding ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I think the idea here is that if the mutations recombine, the combined phage would cause lysis in both strains. So when you dilute each plating separately, the number of plumes depends on whether the mutation is present in each plating. If a mutation exists in a plating for strain B, it will cause lysis there; similarly for strain K. The total number of plumes observed should reflect how many times each strain was lysed. \n\nLet me break it down. For the first half, which is 1:10^7 dilution, only strain B is being plated. If the mutation is present, then when you dilute it enough, it might still be detected as a plume. However, since only one type of phage is being plated here, any recombination within this group wouldn't affect the outcome because all the phages are the same except for the mutation. Wait, no\u2014the first half has only the lysogenic phage, right? Because the problem says \"mutant phages\" carrying these mutations. So maybe the lysogenic phage is the one causing the issue, while the lytic one isn't. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, the lysogenic phage carries the mutation that makes it lytic, meaning it can replicate inside the E. coli, leading to lysis upon replication. The lytic phage doesn't do that. So when the lysogenic phage is used alone, it causes lysis in E. coli strain B, but not strain K. But when both types are present, both strains might be lysed because the lysogenic phage can now replicate inside both strains. So the initial test probably had only the lysogenic phage, causing strain B to die but not K. Then, they plate the mixture on strain B's lawn, expecting more deaths, but instead, only part of the bacteria dies. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow affecting the presence of the mutation in the E. coli, possibly through recombination or some sort of interaction.\n\nWait, but the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would mean that the two mutations occurred at different sites in the T_4 genome, allowing the phages to interact. If they're recombined, their product would have a mutation that affects both strains, leading to more deaths than expected. \n\nIn the experiment, when they plate the mixture on strain B's lawn, they saw 4 plumes, which means 4 plasmid-free cells died. On strain K's lawn, they saw 40 plumes, meaning 40 plasmid-free cells died. So the total number of plumes indicates the overall efficacy of the mixture. Since they plated half on B and half on K, the ratio of plumes could relate to the probability of recombination occurring. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of plumes when mixing two independent events is N = n1 + n2 - r, where n1 and n2 are the numbers from each plating, and r is the number of plumes due to recombination. Alternatively, since the recombination leads to double lethality, we can use the equation N = n1 + n2 - r, but sometimes it's modeled as N = n1 + n2 - (n1*n2)/N_total, assuming random interaction. However, in this case, it's simpler to consider that the expected number without recombination would be N_expected = n1 + n2 - r, but I might need to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that without recombination, the mixture would kill n1 + n2 cells. But if recombination occurs, then some cells die twice, reducing the total number of plumes. So the observed number of plumes would indicate the efficiency of killing plus the number killed twice. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes are observed on K and 4 on B, let's denote:\n\nTotal plumes = 40 + 4 = 44. This represents the sum of cells killed once and those killed twice.\n\nIf there was no recombination, we'd expect 40 + 4 = 44 plumes (all cells dying once), but actually, we see fewer because some died twice. The difference tells us about recombination. \n\nSo, if there was complete recombination, every cell would die twice, resulting in 88 plumes (44 * 2). But in reality, we have 44 plumes, which is exactly half of the maximum possible (since 44 = (44/2)*2). This suggests that every cell was killed twice, implying that the two mutations are perfectly recombined. Therefore, the probability of recombination is high.\n\nBut wait, the question provides specific percentages and options, so I need to translate the results into a percentage of recombination. \n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes without recombination would be the sum of the two platings, and with recombination, it decreases. The decrease is proportional to the square of the number of platings, as each combination contributes to recombination. \n\nHowever, another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants. The formula for the expected number of recombinants in a double cross is E = n1 * n2 / N, where N is the total number of plating. In this case, N=44, n1=4, n2=40. So E=4*40/44\u22483.64. \n\nThis means that approximately 3.64 cells have undergone recombination. To find the recombination rate, we divide this by the total number of cells plated, which is 44. So 3.64/44\u22480.0827, or about 8.27%. But this doesn't match any of the given options directly. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. Each recombination event doubles the death, so the number of such events would correspond to the number of plumes. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes are on K and 4 on B, totaling 44, and knowing that each recombination event accounts for an additional death, the number of recombinations would be 40 + 4 - 88 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps a better way is to model the probability of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the probability that a cell survives without recombination. Without recombination, all cells die once, so plumes=44. With recombination, some cells die twice, so plumes=44 - x, where x is the number of dead cells twice. We observe 4 plumes on B and 40 on K, which implies that 4 cells survived without recombination, and 40 cells survived with recombination. Wait, that seems off because 4+40=44, but that would imply that all cells died either once or twice. Actually, the count per strain would depend on the number of cells that died. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes reflects the number of cells that died. For strain B, 4 plumes mean 4 cells died without recombination. For strain K, 40 plumes mean 40 cells died with recombination. This adds up to 44 cells, which matches the total number of platings. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for genetic interference, which relates the probability of recombination to the observed interference. The formula is p = 1 - e^{-2x}, where x is the number of recombinants per chromosome. But this might be more complex than needed here.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for crossover frequency, which is the probability that a crossover occurs between two points. In this case, the number of recombination events (x) is related to the number of plating. Since each recombination event reduces the number of plumes, the observed reduction gives us the number of recombines.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Without recombination, plumes=44.\n- With recombination, plumes=40 on K and 4 on B, total 44.\n\nWait, that doesn't change anything. Maybe I need to think differently. The expected number of plumes when there's no recombination is the sum of platings minus the number of recombinants. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the expected number of recombinants R is given by R = n1 * n2 / N, where N is the total number of cells plated. Here, N=88 (44 from each half). So R=4*40/88\u22481.636. \n\nThis means that approximately 1.636 cells underwent recombination. The recombination rate is R/N \u22481.636/88\u22480.0187, or about 1.87%, which rounds to approximately 2%. Looking back at the options, option F is 0.3 percent, but my calculation is around 2%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). But none of the options is exactly 2%. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try again. If R=1.636, then the recombination rate is R/(n1 + n2)=1.636/88\u22480.0187, or 1.87%. None of the options match this exactly. The closest is option C (1.5%) and D (0.1%), but neither is close. Maybe I've misunderstood the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction is calculated as R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). Plugging in n1=4 and n2=40, R=4*40/(4+40)=160/44\u22483.636. This is over 100%, which is impossible, so I must have the formula wrong.\n\nAh, I see! The correct formula for recombination frequency is R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). But since R cannot exceed 1, if n1*n2 > n1+n2, which is often the case, it suggests that all cells experienced recombination. But in our case, n1=4 and n2=40. So R=4*40/(4+40)=160/44\u22483.636, which is greater than 1, indicating that all cells were recombined. That can't be right because the observed plumes don't support that.\n\nMaybe the formula is R=(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). If R exceeds 1, it suggests perfect recombination. But in our scenario, R=3.636>1, so all cells were recombined. But that contradicts the observation where some cells died twice. So perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative method: The expected number of cells that die twice is equal to the product of the probabilities of recombination at each site. Assuming independence, P(recombine at both sites)=p^2. The number of such cells would be p^2*N, where N is the total number of cells. The total plumes would be N*(1-p^2). \n\nWe know that the total plumes are 44, so 44=N*(1-p^2). Also, the number of plumes without recombination would be N*(1-p), which equals 44 - x, where x is the number of dead cells twice. But without recombination, all cells die once, so x=0. Thus, 44=N*(1-p). From the above, 44=N*(1-p), and 44=N*(1-p^2).\n\nSubtracting the two equations: 0 = N*p^2 - N*p => N*p(p -1)=0. So p=0 or p=1. But p can't be 0 because then all cells would survive. So p=1. That suggests that all cells underwent recombination, which again conflicts with the observed data.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look for another approach. The key point is that the observed number of plumes is lower than expected without recombination, suggesting some degree of recombination. The expected number without recombination is 44 plumes (4+40). The observed number is also 44, which implies that there was no recombination. But that contradicts the fact that some cells died twice, implying recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that without recombination, all cells die once, giving 44 plumes. With recombination, some cells die twice, reducing the number of plumes. So the observed number is less than 44, which aligns with the data: 40 on K and 4 on B, totaling 44. So the recombination reduces the number of plumes by 4. \n\nHow much recombination leads to 4 less plumes? The difference comes from cells that died twice. Each cell that dies twice reduces the total plumes by 1. So if 4 cells died twice, the total plumes would be 44 - 4 = 40. But in the data, K has 40 and B has 4, adding up to 44. So this suggests that 4 cells died twice, which would require 4 recombination events. \n\nNow, the number of recombination events R can be approximated by the formula R = 2 * (number of dead cells twice) / (total number of cells). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, R = 2 * (number of dead cells twice) / (total number of cells). So R=2*4/44\u22480.1818, or ~18.18% of the cells underwent recombination. \n\nLooking at the options, option G is 0.5 percent, and option H is 0.02 percent. Neither is near 18%. So I must be making a mistake somewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is R = (number of recombination events) / (total number of potential recombination sites). If there are two sites, then R can range from 0 to 1. But without knowing the exact number of sites, this approach is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is 44, which is exactly the expected without recombination, it suggests that there was no recombination. But that contradicts the observation that some cells died twice. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the observed number of plumes is 44, which is the same as without recombination, implying no recombination occurred. But that can't be right because the data shows some cells dying twice.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the results. The total number of plumes is 44, which is the same as the expected without recombination. But why does that happen? It could mean that no recombination occurred because all cells died once, so no cells died twice. However, the data shows that 40 plumes appeared on K and 4 on B, which together make 44. If no recombination happened, K would have 44 plumes, but according to the experiment, K had only 4. Similarly, B had 40. So that doesn't add up. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when recombination happens, some cells die twice, which would reduce the total number of plumes. So if there's recombination, the total plumes would be less than 44. But in the experiment, the total plumes are 44, which suggests no recombination.

But that's contradictory to the observation.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the number of plumes is equal to the number of cells that died without recombination plus twice the number that died with recombination. Let me define R as the number of cells that died with recombination. Then:\n\nPlumes without recombination = n1 + n2 - 2R.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The total plumes would be the number of cells that died without recombination plus twice the number that died with recombination. So:\n\nTotal plumes = (n1 - R) + 2R = n1 + R.\n\nSimilarly, for strain B:\n\nTotal plumes = (n2 - R) + 2R = n2 + R.\n\nAdding both:\n\nTotal plumes = n1 + n2 + R = 44 + R.\n\nBut we know the total plumes are 44, so 44 = 44 + R \u21d2 R=0. So no recombination occurred. Again, this suggests zero recombination, which is not among the options.\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination frequency is zero, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the observed number of plumes includes both normal and double lethality, implying full recombination. But according to the calculations, that's not possible without R exceeding ",

    "rollout": " \n\nSo, I think the key here is figuring out how these mutations interact. If they were completely independent, we'd expect the number of recombinant plumes to be around half of each, maybe? But here, since one is causing lysis and the other isn't, perhaps their interactions determine whether a plume appears on each lawn. \n\nWait, but the main point is about recombination rate. Recombination would mean that the two mutations influence the same site in the phage DNA. If they're tightly linked, a mutation in one phage might cause issues for the other, leading to more or fewer recombinants. \n\nIn the experiment, the fraction of plumes on strain K (which has the lysogenic mutation) is 4/ (4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. Similarly, on strain B, it's 40/44\u224890.9%. So almost all plumes are on strain K, meaning that most of the time, the lysogenic phage caused by the first type was successful, but sometimes the second type also contributed. \n\nBut wait, actually, if the mutations are independent, we'd expect a certain distribution. However, if they are linked, you'd see more or less depending on the distance. Since this is a single locus, the effect might be more straightforward. \n\nLet me think about the expected outcome. If the two mutations are linked, then each mutation will affect the fitness of the phage. The lysogenic phage (without the mutation) should replicate without issues, while the mutant phage (with the mutation) would die during replication. This could lead to a situation where the lysogenic phage is more common among those that don't have the mutation. \n\nBut in this case, the majority of plumes are on K, which has the lysogenic mutation. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is being expressed more often than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the phage DNA to have a higher chance of being replicated correctly, leading to more plasmids and more lysogenic phages surviving. \n\nWait, another angle: if the mutations are tightly linked, then the lysogenic phage (mutated) might have an advantage in terms of replication efficiency. This could lead to a higher frequency of lysogenic phages. In the experiment, since K has the lysogenic mutation, it's more likely to express the lysogenic phage, hence more plumes on K. \n\nThe fraction of plumes on K is roughly 9%, which is quite high. If the mutations were independent, I would expect a certain distribution, but here it's skewed towards K. However, the exact calculation needed is probably about calculating the percentage of recombinants. \n\nWait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the occurrence where a mutation from one phage affects the replication of another phage at the same locus. If they are tightly linked, the likelihood of recombination is high. \n\nGiven that 40% of the plumes are on B and 60% on K, but since K has the lysogenic mutation, perhaps the recombination occurs frequently enough that a significant portion of the lysogenic phages come from that source. \n\nAlternatively, the actual calculation might involve determining the probability of recombination given the observed data. Let me try to model this. Suppose the total number of plasmids on each lawn is N. On K, 4 plumes occur, so 4/N plasmids are lost due to lysogeny. On B, 40 plumes occur, so 40/N. \n\nIf the two mutations are tightly linked, the loss of plasmids due to lysogeny would be influenced by the proximity of the mutation sites. The fraction of plasmids lost would depend on the degree of linkage. The formula for the fraction lost due to recombination is (1 - d), where d is the coefficient of coincidence. But in this case, it seems like the fraction lost is directly related to the presence of the lysogenic mutation. \n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up how to calculate recombination rates based on plume counts. From what I remember, the number of plumes on each lawn depends on whether the lysogenic phage is active (so no plume on the target lawn) or if it's partially active (so a plume forms on the target lawn). \n\nBut in this case, the K lawn has 4 plumes, implying that the lysogenic phage is active there, while B has 40 plumes, indicating partial activity or non-recruitment. Wait, but B is primarily affected because it's lysogenic, so why are there 40 plumes? Hmm, maybe because the lysogenic phage can integrate into multiple copies, leading to more plumes. Or perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows it to replicate more effectively, leading to more plumes on the target lawn. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it should replicate without problems, so it shouldn't cause plumes on B. But in reality, the K lawn shows plumes, suggesting the lysogenic phage is active there. So maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage allows it to replicate better, leading to more plumes on B. \n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage can integrate and replicate efficiently, which happens more easily on strain K. So the recombination rate is low because integrating is easier on K. Therefore, the number of plumes on B increases because the lysogenic phage can integrate well there, making the phage more active. \n\nTo find the recombination rate, we can use the formula for the number of plumes on each lawn, which relates to the number of times the phage integrates. If R is the recombination rate (percentage), then the number of plumes on the target lawn is proportional to (1 - R/100). For example, if R is 10%, then 90% of the phage integrations occur, leading to 90 plumes on the target lawn. \n\nIn our case, let's denote R as the recombination rate in percent. Then:\n\nFor K (target lawn):\nNumber of plumes = 4 = (1 - R/100)*Total plumes\n\nFor B:\nNumber of plumes = 40 = (1 - R/100)*Total plumes\n\nWait, but this assumes that the total plumes are the same on both lawns. Is that correct? Actually, the total plumes on each lawn are determined by the phage population. Since both lawns are treated with the same amount of phage, the total plumes per lawn should be similar, assuming the same growth conditions. \n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation using the ratio of plumes. Let\u2019s assume that the total plumes on both lawns are the same, say P. Then:\n\nOn K: 4 = (1 - R/100)*P \u2192 P = 4 / (1 - R/100)\n\nOn B: 40 = (1 - R/100)*P \u2192 40 = (1 - R/100)*(4 / (1 - R/100)) ) \u2192 40 = 4/(1 - R/100)^2 \u2192 (1 - R/100)^2 = 4/40 = 1/10 \u2192 1 - R/100 = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.3162 \u2192 R/100 \u2248 1 - 0.3162 = 0.6838 \u2192 R \u2248 68.38%\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the options provided are much lower. Maybe my approach is flawed. Perhaps instead, the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination rate. Let me try again.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the recombination rate. Let\u2019s denote x as the recombination rate (in decimal form). Then:\n\nOn K: 4 = x * Total_plumes_K\n\nOn B: 40 = x * Total_plumes_B\n\nSince Total_plumes_K and Total_plumes_B are the same (assuming equal dilution and treatment), we can write:\n\nx = 4 / Total_plumes_K = 40 / Total_plumes_B \u2192 4 / Total = 40 / Total \u2192 Which leads to 4 = 40 \u2192 Impossible. So, clearly, my assumption is wrong.\n\nAnother approach: Let\u2019s consider that the number of plumes on each lawn is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. Because if the recombination rate is low, more plumes are lost, and vice versa. \n\nSo, if x is the recombination rate, then:\n\nOn K: Number of plumes = Total_plumes_K * (1 - x)\n\nOn B: Number of plumes = Total_plumes_B * (1 - x)\n\nBut since Total_plumes_K and Total_plumes_B are the same, we get:\n\n4 = (1 - x) * P\n\n40 = (1 - x) * P\n\nWhich again gives 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. So, this approach must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plumes is directly proportional to the recombination rate. Meaning:\n\nx = Number of plumes / Total_plumes\n\nThen,\n\nx = 4 / P\n\nand\n\nx = 40 / P\n\nAgain, leading to 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. So, this indicates that my initial assumptions about the relationship between plume count and recombination rate are incorrect.\n\nMaybe the correct relationship is that the number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. That\u2019s because the variance in plume numbers scales with the square root of the rate under Poisson statistics.\n\nSo, let's try that. Let\u2019s assume that:\n\n\u221ax = Number of plumes / \u221aTotal_plumes\n\nThen,\n\n\u221ax = 4 / \u221aP\n\nand\n\n\u221ax = 40 / \u221aP\n\nWhich still leads to 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. If the lysogenic phage (from strain K) is more common, then the recombination rate is high, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrates well. So, perhaps the fraction of plumes on K corresponds to the recombination rate.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices are in percentages. Option F is 0.3 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the plumes on K are 4 out of 44, which is approximately 9%, and on B, 40 out of 44, which is ~90%. The difference suggests a high recombination rate because more plumes are coming from K. If the recombination rate is high, say 68%, then 1 - x = 0.32, so x = 0.68, but none of the options match that. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the recombination rate using the observed plume fractions. The fraction of plumes on K is 4/(4+40)= ~9%, which implies that 9% of the potential plumes are coming from K, meaning that the recombination rate is 9%. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the fraction is 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9%, which would suggest a 9% recombination rate. But the closest option is E, 0.05%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to model it differently. Suppose that the recombination rate is x. Then, the number of plumes on K is proportional to (1 - x), and similarly for B. \n\nFrom the data:\n\nOn K: 4 = (1 - x) * P\n\nOn B: 40 = (1 - x) * Q\n\nAssuming P = Q (since both are plated on similar amounts), then 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. Thus, perhaps the recombination rate is such that (1 - x) is proportional to the ratio of plume counts.\n\nSo, 4 / 40 = (1 - x)/ (1 - x) \u2192 Again, 1=1 \u2192 Doesn't help.\n\nAlternative approach: The difference in plume counts reflects the difference in recombination rates. The ratio is 40/4 = 10, which suggests that the recombination rate on B is 10 times that on K. If r is the recombination rate on K, then on B it's 10*r. But since the plumes on B are 40, which is 10 times more, that suggests that r on B is 10*r on K. But this doesn't directly give us r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is the same for both, but the plume count reflects the difference in selection pressure. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it might be selected against, leading to fewer plumes on K. But in this case, K has more plumes, so integration is less frequent there.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me recall that when two mutations are tightly linked, the fraction of plumes lost (due to recombination) depends on the coefficient of coincidence, which is usually close to 1. The fraction lost is approximately 1 - d, where d is the coefficient of coincidence. But without knowing d, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of plumes lost on each lawn is proportional to the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to more plumes on the target lawn. So, if the lysogenic phage integrates more easily on K, there are fewer plumes lost there, resulting in more plumes on K. \n\nThus, the fraction of plumes lost on K is less than on B. Given that, if we assume the plume losses are proportional to the recombination rate, we can relate the fractions:\n\nFraction on K = 4/(4 + 40) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nFraction on B = 40/44 \u2248 0.9091\n\nIf the recombination rate is x, then the fraction lost on K is x, and on B is x as well, but since the plume counts differ, perhaps the loss rates aren't the same. Wait, no, the loss rates would be the same if the recombination rate is the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loss rates are different because of varying selection pressures. If the lysogenic phage has a higher fitness, it might lose plumes more readily, leading to a higher loss rate on K compared to B. \n\nBut without specific information on selection pressures, it's hard to quantify. However, looking at the options, the highest plausible loss rate is 68% (option D, 0.1%), followed by 9% (option F). Since K has only 4 plumes, which is less than half of B's 40, it suggests a higher loss rate on K, implying a higher recombination rate. \n\nIf the loss rate on K is higher, then the recombination rate would be higher. For instance, if the loss rate on K is 90%, then recombination rate is 90%, which is not an option. But perhaps the loss rate is related to the fraction of plumes. Let me consider that the loss rate is the fraction of plumes lost due to recombination. \n\nIf on K, the loss rate is 90% (i.e., 9 plumes lost), but according to the data, only 4 plumes lost, so that's inconsistent. Alternatively, if the loss rate is 4/44 \u2248 9%, then the recombination rate is 9%. But this is not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the loss rate is calculated differently. If the recombination rate is x, then the loss rate is x. So, the fraction lost on K is x, and on B is x. However, the plume counts are different, so the fraction lost is proportional to the fraction of plumes lost. \n\nFor example:\n\nLoss on K: x * P\n\nLoss on B: x * Q\n\nBut if P \u2260 Q, then x cannot be determined unless we know the relative plume counts. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the loss rate is proportional to the recombination rate, and that the fraction lost is proportional to the plume counts. \n\nSuppose the loss rate on K is L, and on B is M. Then, L = k * x, M = k * x, where k is a constant. But since the plume counts are different, L/K = M/B. \n\nBut without knowing k, this doesn't help. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to accept that the recombination rate is high, leading to the fraction lost on K being higher, thus requiring a higher recombination rate. Among the options, 0.68% is not available, but 0.05% (option E) is the lowest. However, the calculations don't support a 0.68% rate; rather, the plume count suggests a higher rate. \n\nWait, going back to the original calculation where I tried setting up equations, even though it led to a contradiction, perhaps I missed something. Let me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nOn K: 4 plumes = (1 - x) * P\n\nOn B: 40 plumes = (1 - x) * P\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n4 = (1 - x) * P \u2192 P = 4 / (1 - x)\n\n40 = (1 - x) * P \u2192 Substitute P from above: 40 = (1 - x) * (4 / (1 - x)) \u2192 40 = 4 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect, meaning that the plume counts do not scale linearly with the recombination rate. Instead, they may follow a different relationship, perhaps involving the square root.\n\nIf we assume that the number of plumes lost is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate, then:\n\n\u221aL = \u221ax\n\nWhere L is the number of plumes lost. \n\nSo, on K: \u221a4 = \u221ax \u2192 2 = \u221ax \u2192 x = 4\n\nOn B: \u221a40 = \u221ax \u2192 approx 6.3246 = \u221ax \u2192 x \u2248 40\n\nBut this again leads to inconsistency since both would require x to be greater than 1, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction lost is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. \n\nSo, fraction lost on K: \u221ax = 4 / P\n\nFraction lost on B: \u221ax = 40 / P\n\nAgain, leading to the same issue.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number",

Meaning:\n\nx = Number of plumes / Total_plumes\n\nThen,\n\nx = 4 / P\n\nand\n\nx = 40 / P\n\nAgain, leading to 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. So, this indicates that my initial assumptions about the relationship between plume count and recombination rate are incorrect.\n\nMaybe the correct relationship is that the number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. That\u2019s because the variance in plume numbers scales with the square root of the rate under Poisson statistics.\n\nSo, let's try that. Let\u2019s assume that:\n\n\u221ax = Number of plumes / \u221aTotal_plumes\n\nThen,\n\n\u221ax = 4 / \u221aP\n\nand\n\n\u221ax = 40 / \u221aP\n\nWhich still leads to 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. If the lysogenic phage (from strain K) is more common, then the recombination rate is high, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrates well. So, perhaps the fraction of plumes on K corresponds to the recombination rate.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices are in percentages. Option F is 0.3 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the plumes on K are 4 out of 44, which is approximately 9%, and on B, 40 out of 44, which is ~90%. The difference suggests a high recombination rate because more plumes are coming from K. If the recombination rate is high, say 68%, then 1 - x = 0.32, so x = 0.68, but none of the options match that. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the recombination rate using the observed plume fractions. The fraction of plumes on K is 4/(4+40)= ~9%, which implies that 9% of the potential plumes are coming from K, meaning that the recombination rate is 9%. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the fraction is 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9%, which would suggest a 9% recombination rate. But the closest option is E, 0.05%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to model it differently. Suppose that the recombination rate is x. Then, the number of plumes on K is proportional to (1 - x), and similarly for B. \n\nFrom the data:\n\nOn K: 4 = (1 - x) * P\n\nOn B: 40 = (1 - x) * Q\n\nAssuming P = Q (since both are plated on similar amounts), then 4 = 40 \u2192 Contradiction. Thus, perhaps the recombination rate is such that (1 - x) is proportional to the ratio of plume counts.\n\nSo, 4 / 40 = (1 - x)/ (1 - x) \u2192 Again, 1=1 \u2192 Doesn't help.\n\nAlternative approach: The difference in plume counts reflects the difference in recombination rates. The ratio is 40/4 = 10, which suggests that the recombination rate on B is 10 times that on K. If r is the recombination rate on K, then on B it's 10*r. But since the plumes on B are 40, which is 10 times more, that suggests that r on B is 10*r on K. But this doesn't directly give us r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is the same for both, but the plume count reflects the difference in selection pressure. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it might be selected against, leading to fewer plumes on K. But in this case, K has more plumes, so integration is less frequent there.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me recall that when two mutations are tightly linked, the fraction of plumes lost (due to recombination) depends on the coefficient of coincidence, which is usually close to 1. The fraction lost is approximately 1 - d, where d is the coefficient of coincidence. But without knowing d, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of plumes lost on each lawn is proportional to the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to more plumes on the target lawn. So, if the lysogenic phage integrates more easily on K, there are fewer plumes lost there, resulting in more plumes on K. \n\nThus, the fraction of plumes lost on K is less than on B. Given that, if we assume the plume losses are proportional to the recombination rate, we can relate the fractions:\n\nFraction on K = 4/(4 + 40) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909\n\nFraction on B = 40/44 \u2248 0.9091\n\nIf the recombination rate is x, then the fraction lost on K is x, and on B is x as well, but since the plume counts differ, perhaps the loss rates aren't the same. Wait, no, the loss rates would be the same if the recombination rate is the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loss rates are different because of varying selection pressures. If the lysogenic phage has a higher fitness, it might lose plumes more readily, leading to a higher loss rate on K compared to B. \n\nBut without specific information on selection pressures, it's hard to quantify. However, looking at the options, the highest plausible loss rate is 68% (option D, 0.1%), followed by 9% (option F). Since K has only 4 plumes, which is less than half of B's 40, it suggests a higher loss rate on K, implying a higher recombination rate. \n\nIf the loss rate on K is higher, then the recombination rate would be higher. For instance, if the loss rate on K is 90%, then recombination rate is 90%, which is not an option. But perhaps the loss rate is related to the fraction of plumes. Let me consider that the loss rate is the fraction of plumes lost due to recombination. \n\nIf on K, the loss rate is 90% (i.e., 9 plumes lost), but according to the data, only 4 plumes lost, so that's inconsistent. Alternatively, if the loss rate is 4/44 \u2248 9%, then the recombination rate is 9%. But this is not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the loss rate is calculated differently. If the recombination rate is x, then the loss rate is x. So, the fraction lost on K is x, and on B is x. However, the plume counts are different, so the fraction lost is proportional to the fraction of plumes lost. \n\nFor example:\n\nLoss on K: x * P\n\nLoss on B: x * Q\n\nBut if P \u2260 Q, then x cannot be determined unless we know the relative plume counts. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the loss rate is proportional to the recombination rate, and that the fraction lost is proportional to the plume counts. \n\nSuppose the loss rate on K is L, and on B is M. Then, L = k * x, M = k * x, where k is a constant. But since the plume counts are different, L/K = M/B. \n\nBut without knowing k, this doesn't help. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to accept that the recombination rate is high, leading to the fraction lost on K being higher, thus requiring a higher recombination rate. Among the options, 0.68% is not available, but 0.05% (option E) is the lowest. However, the calculations don't support a 0.68% rate; rather, the plume count suggests a higher rate. \n\nWait, going back to the original calculation where I tried setting up equations, even though it led to a contradiction, perhaps I missed something. Let me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nOn K: 4 plumes = (1 - x) * P\n\nOn B: 40 plumes = (1 - x) * P\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n4 = (1 - x) * P \u2192 P = 4 / (1 - x)\n\n40 = (1 - x) * P \u2192 Substitute P from above: 40 = (1 - x) * (4 / (1 - x)) \u2192 40 = 4 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect, meaning that the plume counts do not scale linearly with the recombination rate. Instead, they may follow a different relationship, perhaps involving the square root.\n\nIf we assume that the number of plumes lost is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate, then:\n\n\u221aL = \u221ax\n\nWhere L is the number of plumes lost. \n\nSo, on K: \u221a4 = \u221ax \u2192 2 = \u221ax \u2192 x = 4\n\nOn B: \u221a40 = \u221ax \u2192 approx 6.3246 = \u221ax \u2192 x \u2248 40\n\nBut this again leads to inconsistency since both would require x to be greater than 1, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction lost is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. \n\nSo, fraction lost on K: \u221ax = 4 / P\n\nFraction lost on B: \u221ax = 40 / P\n\nAgain, leading to the same issue.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number",

The concentration of phages depends on the dilution factor. For example, 1:10^5 means 0.00001 phages per well, and 1:10^7 is 0.0000001 phages. Multiplying these gives 1e-11 phage-mutation combinations.

If they do, the offspring might have a new mutation profile. In this case, since one type of phage is causing issues in strain B but not K, maybe their recombination affects how well they replicate or translate in the presence of each strain. \n\nThe key here is figuring out the number of recombinant plasmids. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is often calculated as 1 - (number of non-recombinant alleles / total alleles). But wait, in this context, it's about plasmid inheritance. Each bacterium has a certain number of plasmids, and the mutations cause different outcomes depending on whether they're plasmid-encoded genes or not.\n\nWhen the phages are tested on different bacterial strains, the results depend on whether the mutations are replicated or translated. Since one phage is causing lysis (so it must be replicating), it would affect all bacteria, while the other is lysogenic, meaning it should replicate within the host without being detected. However, the observed effect on the population suggests that the phage types interact, possibly through recombination.\n\nThe dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. Dilution factors determine how many copies are present in each test tube. Plating on a lawn means exposing the bacteria to the phage and counting the number of colonies formed. More colonies indicate more successful infection.\n\nIn the first scenario, where the phages are plated on strain B's lawn, only 40 plumes appeared. On the second scenario, when plated on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes appeared. This difference suggests that the phages affecting strain B did better when plated on strain K, implying that their effects are influenced by the presence of strain K. \n\nWait, maybe it's about the presence of the other strain affecting the outcome. So, when both phages are present, the ones from strain B's lawn may be less effective against strain K because of interference or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of strain K changes the environment in a way that affects the phages' activity relative to strain B.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, only a small fraction (4 out of 40) of the phages from strain B's lawn produce a new plume on strain K's lawn. That implies that these 4 are more resistant to the strain K phage than the others. Similarly, when only strain B's phage is present, more plumes appear on strain K's lawn, indicating that they are more susceptible. This suggests that the phages from strain B interact with strain K in a way that either enhances their ability to replicate or infect, leading to different outcomes.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the mutations are linked, and their combination leads to a higher likelihood of recombination. Recombination increases the chances that the mutated phage will replicate correctly or translate properly in the presence of the other strain.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant plasmids would influence the ratio of plumes seen on the two plates. The higher number of recombinants on the strain B plate compared to the strain K plate could suggest that the phages from strain B are more likely to have caused recombination events with strain K's phages. \n\nTo quantify this, I recall that the coefficient of coincidence (CO) is used to measure the correlation between independent events. CO = (observed recombinants / expected recombinants). If the CO is high, it indicates that the two events are occurring independently.\n\nHere, the expected recombinants would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutation types. The observed recombinants are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, no, actually, the CO is calculated by comparing the observed number of recombinants over the expected number. \n\nLet me try to set up the equation. Suppose x is the number of recombinant plasmids. Then, the probability of a recombinant event is x/(n), where n is the total number of plasmids. But since we're dealing with probabilities across multiple plating, the CO would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation happening.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for CO:\n\nCO = (number of recombinant plumes observed) / (expected recombinant plumes)\n\nExpected recombinant plumes would be (frequency of mutation A * frequency of mutation B) * total plasts plated.\n\nAssuming equal frequencies, let's say p for mutation A and q for mutation B. Then, the expected recombinant plumes would be p*q*N, where N is the total number of plasmids plated.\n\nFrom the data:\nOn strain B's lawn (with both mutations): 4 plumes.\nOn strain K's lawn (only one mutation): 40 plumes.\n\nSo, the expected recombinant plumes would be the number of plasmids in the B plate multiplied by the number in the K plate? Or perhaps it's the product of the frequencies.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. The CO is the ratio of observed recombinant plumes divided by the expected recombinant plumes. \n\nIf x is the number of recombinants observed, then CO = x / (n_A * n_B), where n_A and n_B are the numbers of plasmids in each plate.\n\nBut I don't know the exact numbers of plasmids. Maybe another approach. The problem states that the result was \"divided in half,\" meaning each half was half the original number. But I'm not sure how much dilution each plate had.\n\nAlternatively, considering the difference in the number of plumes, maybe the presence of strain K reduces the effectiveness of strain B's phage, indicating a positive correlation. So, when both are present, the number of recombinants is lower (more susceptible) on strain K, suggesting that the presence of strain K reduced the efficiency of the phages from strain B.\n\nWait, that makes sense. If the phages from strain B are more efficient at replicating or infecting strain K, then fewer plumes would form on strain K's lawn. Conversely, when only strain B's phage is present, it's less effective against strain K, forming more plumes on strain K's lawn.\n\nSo, the number of recombinant plasmids would relate to the strength of this negative correlation. The observed decrease in recombinant plumes when both phages are present supports a positive correlation between the two mutations. Thus, the actual number of recombinant plasmids is related to the number of times they successfully combined.\n\nGiven that, the coefficient of coincidence (CO) would help. CO = (observed recombinant plumes) / (expected recombinant plumes).\n\nIf the CO is around 0.05, that's 5%, which corresponds to a moderate level of recombination. But let's calculate it.\n\nSuppose the expected recombinant plumes are the number of plasmids in the B plate multiplied by those in the K plate, divided by the total number of plasmids. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky. Maybe an approximate calculation.\n\nWe have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Let's assume each plate has the same number of plasmids. Then, the expected recombinant plumes would be (4/40)^2 = 0.04, assuming independence. But that's too low.\n\nAlternatively, if the expected recombinants are 40 (since K has 40), and observed is 4, then CO = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. That seems high. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: The number of recombinant plasmids can be estimated by the ratio of observed to expected. Expected recombinants would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Assuming each mutation occurs once per phage, the expected recombinant plasmids would be 1/total_plasmids. But I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of recombinants to the amount of recombination. The formula for the number of recombinant plasmids is R = p*q*N, where p and q are the allele frequencies, and N is the number of plasmids. \n\nBut without specific numbers, I'm stuck. Maybe I'll make an educated guess based on the options given. The possible answers are percentages in increments of 0.1%. The correct answer is likely 2% (option B), but I'm not entirely sure.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that when two mutations occur in the same gene, especially if one affects replication and the other affects translation, they can sometimes recombine. If they do, the offspring might have a new mutation profile. In this case, since one type of phage is causing issues in strain B but not K, maybe their recombination affects how well they replicate or translate in the presence of each strain. \n\nThe key here is figuring out the number of recombinant plasmids. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is often calculated as 1 - (number of non-recombinant alleles / total alleles). But wait, in this context, it's about plasmid inheritance. Each bacterium has a certain number of plasmids, and the mutations cause different outcomes depending on whether they're plasmid-encoded genes or not.\n\nWhen the phages are tested on different bacterial strains, the results depend on whether the mutations are replicated or translated. Since one phage is causing lysis (so it must be replicating), it would affect all bacteria, while the other is lysogenic, meaning it should replicate within the host without being detected. However, the observed effect on the population suggests that the phage types interact, possibly through recombination.\n\nThe dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. Dilution factors determine how many copies are present in each test tube. Plating on a lawn means exposing the bacteria to the phage and counting the number of colonies formed. More colonies indicate more successful infection.\n\nIn the first scenario, where the phages are plated on strain B's lawn, only 40 plumes appeared. On the second scenario, when plated on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes appeared. This difference suggests that the phages affecting strain B did better when plated on strain K, implying that their effects are influenced by the presence of strain K. \n\nWait, maybe it's about the presence of the other strain affecting the outcome. So, when both phages are present, the ones from strain B's lawn may be less effective against strain K because of interference or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of strain K changes the environment in a way that affects the phages' activity relative to strain B.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, only a small fraction (4 out of 40) of the phages from strain B's lawn produce a new plume on strain K's lawn. That implies that these 4 are more resistant to the strain K phage than the others. Similarly, when only strain B's phage is present, more plumes appear on strain K's lawn, indicating that they are more susceptible. This suggests that the phages from strain B interact with strain K in a way that either enhances their ability to replicate or infect, leading to different outcomes.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the mutations are linked, and their combination leads to a higher likelihood of recombination. Recombination increases the chances that the mutated phage will replicate correctly or translate properly in the presence of the other strain.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant plasmids would influence the ratio of plumes seen on the two plates. The higher number of recombinants on the strain B plate compared to the strain K plate could suggest that the phages from strain B are more likely to have caused recombination events with strain K's phages. \n\nTo quantify this, I recall that the coefficient of coincidence (CO) is used to measure the correlation between independent events. CO = (observed recombinants / expected recombinants). If the CO is high, it indicates that the two events are occurring independently.\n\nHere, the expected recombinants would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutation types. The observed recombinants are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, no, actually, the CO is calculated by comparing the observed number of recombinants over the expected number. \n\nLet me try to set up the equation. Suppose x is the number of recombinant plasmids. Then, the probability of a recombinant event is x/(n), where n is the total number of plasmids. But since we're dealing with probabilities across multiple plating, the CO would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation happening.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for CO:\n\nCO = (number of recombinant plumes observed) / (expected recombinant plumes)\n\nExpected recombinant plumes would be (frequency of mutation A * frequency of mutation B) * total plasts plated.\n\nAssuming equal frequencies, let's say p for mutation A and q for mutation B. Then, the expected recombinant plumes would be p*q*N, where N is the total number of plasmids plated.\n\nFrom the data:\nOn strain B's lawn (with both mutations): 4 plumes.\nOn strain K's lawn (only one mutation): 40 plumes.\n\nSo, the expected recombinant plumes would be the number of plasmids in the B plate multiplied by the number in the K plate? Or perhaps it's the product of the frequencies.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. The CO is the ratio of observed recombinant plumes divided by the expected recombinant plumes. \n\nIf x is the number of recombinants observed, then CO = x / (n_A * n_B), where n_A and n_B are the numbers of plasmids in each plate.\n\nBut I don't know the exact numbers of plasmids. Maybe another approach. The problem states that the result was \"divided in half,\" meaning each half was half the original number. But I'm not sure how much dilution each plate had.\n\nAlternatively, considering the difference in the number of plumes, maybe the presence of strain K reduces the effectiveness of strain B's phage, indicating a positive correlation. So, when both are present, the number of recombinants is lower (more susceptible) on strain K, suggesting that the presence of strain K reduced the efficiency of the phages from strain B.\n\nWait, that makes sense. If the phages from strain B are more efficient at replicating or infecting strain K, then fewer plumes would form on strain K's lawn. Conversely, when only strain B's phage is present, it's less effective against strain K, forming more plumes on strain K's lawn.\n\nSo, the number of recombinant plasmids would relate to the strength of this negative correlation. The observed decrease in recombinant plumes when both phages are present supports a positive correlation between the two mutations. Thus, the actual number of recombinant plasmids is related to the number of times they successfully combined.\n\nGiven that, the coefficient of coincidence (CO) would help. CO = (observed recombinant plumes) / (expected recombinant plumes).\n\nIf the CO is around 0.05, that's 5%, which corresponds to a moderate level of recombination. But let's calculate it.\n\nSuppose the expected recombinant plumes are the number of plasmids in the B plate multiplied by those in the K plate, divided by the total number of plasmids. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky. Maybe an approximate calculation.\n\nWe have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Let's assume each plate has the same number of plasmids. Then, the expected recombinant plumes would be (4/40)^2 = 0.04, assuming independence. But that's too low.\n\nAlternatively, if the expected recombinants are 40 (since K has 40), and observed is 4, then CO = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. That seems high. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: The number of recombinant plasmids can be estimated by the ratio of observed to expected. Expected recombinants would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Assuming each mutation occurs once per phage, the expected recombinant plasmids would be 1/total_plasmids. But I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of recombinants to the amount of recombination. The formula for the number of recombinant plasmids is R = p*q*N, where p and q are the allele frequencies, and N is the number of plasmids. \n\nBut without specific numbers, I'm stuck. Maybe I'll make an educated guess based on the options given. The possible answers are percentages in increments of 0.1%. The correct answer is likely 2% (option B), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, 1.5% (C) or 0.5% (F).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

This is called recombination. In such cases, the number of plumes observed should be around 100 times the product of the frequencies of each mutation. So if we denote the frequency of mutation A as p and mutation B as q, then the expected number of plumes would be about pq * 100. \n\nIn this case, since one phage type causes lysogeny (so maybe mutation A) and the other causes lytic fission (mutation B), their interaction might lead to a recombinant mutation. If the frequency of mutation A is low and mutation B is high, the expected number would be lower. But here, we have more plumes on strain K than on B, suggesting that the interaction resulted in higher occurrence on K. Wait, no\u2014because the first sample was on B and the second on K. Hmm, perhaps the recombination led to increased activity on K. \n\nWait, let me think again. Normally, if you have two non-interacting mutations, their independent assortment would predict certain counts, but when they interact, especially during phage replication, they can produce recombinants. The number of recombinant plumes is typically much higher than either individual mutation. For example, in E. coli with two mutants, if each has a frequency of 1%, the expected recombinant plumes would be around 100*(0.01*0.01)=0.01. But in reality, these events usually happen at much higher frequencies. \n\nBut wait, in our experiment, the ratio of plumes from K to B is 40 vs. 4, which is 10 times higher. That's quite significant. If the expected recombinant plumes were 40 (since 1:10^5 is dilution factor, and 40 plumes correspond to 40/1e5 = 0.004 probability per site?), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. \n\nThe formula for the number of recombinant plumes is approximately 100 * (p * q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. Here, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. So the count on K is ten times higher than on B. Since the dilutions are 1:1e5 and 1:1e7 respectively, perhaps the actual numbers relate to the product of the mutation frequencies. \n\nIf the expected number on B is 100 * (p*q), and on K it's 100 * (p*r), where r is the frequency in K, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the observed ratio is due to the interaction producing more on K. \n\nLet me try plugging in values. Suppose p is the frequency of mutation causing lysogeny (let's say 1% or 0.01), and q is the frequency of mutation causing lytic fission (maybe also 1%). Then the expected recombinant plumes would be 100*(0.01*0.01) = 0.01, but that seems too low compared to 4 plumes. Alternatively, if q is higher, say 0.1 (10%), then 100*(0.01*0.1) = 1. Still too low. To get 4 plumes, we'd need 400*(0.01*0.1) = 4. So p=0.01, q=0.1 gives 4 plumes. Similarly, on K, if the same applies, maybe p remains 0.01 and q increases further. \n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes on K to B is 10:1, if K has 40 and B has 4, then the ratio is 10:1. This could indicate that the interaction produces 10 times more plumes on K than B. If the expected number is proportional to the product of mutation frequencies, then:\n\nFor B: Expected plumes = 100 * p * q\nFor K: Expected plumes = 100 * p * r\n\nGiven that K has 10 times more plumes than B, we have:\n\n100*p*r = 10*(100*p*q)\nSimplify: r = q\n\nSo the frequencies in K are the same as in B? That doesn't make sense because they're different phages. Or maybe the recombination happens in such a way that the plume counts increase proportionally. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to use the formula for the number of recombinant plumes, which is roughly N = 100 * (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutants. If the observed number on K is 40 and on B is 4, then the ratio is 10:1. Assuming that the frequencies are the same, then f1 * f2 = 40 / 100 = 0.4 for K and 4/100 = 0.04 for B. But this doesn't directly help. \n\nPerhaps instead, the observed ratio tells us how many times more frequent the recombinant is compared to the wild type. So if the wild type is not occurring much, the recombinant plumes would dominate. \n\nAnother angle: when two mutants interact during phage replication, they can produce recombinants. The number of recombinant plumes produced is typically much higher than either mutation alone. In E. coli, when you have two mutants that interfere during replication, you often see an increase in plasmid production. The number of recombinant plumes is calculated using the formula N = 100 * (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of each mutation. \n\nIn our case, the ratio of plumes is 10:1. If the expected recombinant plumes on K are 40, then on B they would be 4. So if K has 10 times more plumes, maybe K's mutation frequency is higher. Let's assume that the frequencies are the same for both regions. Then the ratio of plumes would be 100*(f1*f2)/100*(f1*f2) = 1, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the frequencies in K are higher. \n\nSuppose f1 is 0.01 (1%) for both regions. For B, f2 = x, so 100*(0.01*x) = 4 => x = 0.4. For K, f2 = y, so 100*(0.01*y) = 40 => y = 4. So the frequency of the second mutation increased fourfold in K compared to B. But this seems unlikely unless the phage carries multiple mutations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the interaction leads to more recombination, increasing the plume density. If the expected number on B is 4 and on K is 40, that's exactly 10 times more. So if the formula is N = 100 * (f1 * f2), then 40 = 100*(f1*f2_K) and 4 = 100*(f1*f2_B). Dividing, 10 = (f2_K)/(f2_B). So f2_K = 10*f2_B. \n\nAssuming f1 is the same in both regions, which may not be the case. If f1 is the same, then f2_K = 10*f2_B. Now, plugging back into the equations:\n\nFor B: 4 = 100*(f1*f2_B) \u2192 f1*f2_B = 0.04\nFor K: 40 = 100*(f1*f2_K) \u2192 f1*f2_K = 0.4\n\nSince f2_K = 10*f2_B,\n\n0.4 = f1*(10*f2_B) \u2192 0.4 = 10*(f1*f2_B)\n\nBut from B's equation: f1*f2_B = 0.04\n\nSubstitute: 0.4 = 10*0.04 \u2192 0.4 = 0.4. It checks out.\n\nSo the frequencies satisfy f2_K = 10*f2_B, and f1*f2_B = 0.04. We don't know f1 yet. But we can find f2_B from B's equation: f2_B = 0.04/f1. Since f2_K = 10*f2_B, then f2_K = 10*(0.04/f1) = 0.4/f1. \n\nNow, without knowing f1, we can't determine exact frequencies, but we can express them in terms of f1. However, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations, which likely refers to the percentage of the time the mutations combine. Recombination rate is given by f1*f2. From B's side, f1*f2_B = 0.04. So recombination rate = 0.04. Converting to percentage: 4%. \n\nLooking at the options, option F is 0.3 percent, and G is 0.5 percent. None is exactly 4%. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. If the expected number is 100*(f1*f2), then 4 corresponds to f1*f2=0.04. That's 4%. But the options don't include 4%. Closest is G:0.5%. Alternatively, maybe the calculation requires taking the square root or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination fraction is (f1 + f2)^2 - (f1^2 + f2^2))/2. But that's for interference. If there's complete linkage, recombination fraction is zero. If partial, say 0.5, then the number of recombinant plumes would be higher. \n\nWait, another thought: The number of recombinant plumes is approximately 100*f1*f2. So if on B, 4 plumes, that implies f1*f2=0.04, which is 4%. On K, 40 plumes, implying f1*f2=0.4. But that can't be right; f1 and f2 cannot vary independently. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. \n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency. The number of recombinant plumes is approximately 100 * (f1 * f2). So, for B: 4 = 100*(f1*f2_B) \u2192 f1*f2_B = 0.04. For K: 40 = 100*(f1*f2_K) \u2192 f1*f2_K = 0.4. Therefore, f2_K = 10*f2_B. Substituting into f1*f2_B = 0.04, and f2_K = 10*f2_B, we get f1*f2_K = f1*10*f2_B = 10*(f1*f2_B) = 10*0.04 = 0.4. Which matches the K value. \n\nThus, the recombination frequency is f1*f2. Since f2_K = 10*f2_B, and f1*f2_B = 0.04, then f1*f2_K = 10*(f1*f2_B) = 10*0.04 = 0.4. So the recombination frequency is 0.4, meaning 0.4% of the time, the mutations combine. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is G:0.5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer expects the product f1*f2, which is 0.04, so 4%, but that's not an option. Hmm. Maybe I missed something. Perhaps the phage has multiple mutations, and the recombination occurs across both. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations,\" which probably refers to the percentage of the time the mutations combine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is considered as (f1 + f2)^2 / 2. But that's for interference. If there's no interference, the expected recombinants would be higher. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, going back, the expected number of recombinant plumes is 100*f1*f2. Given that, on B, it's 4 and on K, it's 40. Thus, f1*f2 = 0.04 on B and 0.4 on K. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the phage carrying both mutations doesn't replicate independently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination fraction is (f1*f2)/(f1*f2 + ...). But I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest is G:0.5%. So I'll go with G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So f2_K = 10*f2_B. \n\nAssuming f1 is the same in both regions, which may not be the case. If f1 is the same, then f2_K = 10*f2_B. Now, plugging back into the equations:\n\nFor B: 4 = 100*(f1*f2_B) \u2192 f1*f2_B = 0.04\nFor K: 40 = 100*(f1*f2_K) \u2192 f1*f2_K = 0.4\n\nSince f2_K = 10*f2_B,\n\n0.4 = f1*(10*f2_B) \u2192 0.4 = 10*(f1*f2_B)\n\nBut from B's equation: f1*f2_B = 0.04\n\nSubstitute: 0.4 = 10*0.04 \u2192 0.4 = 0.4. It checks out.\n\nSo the frequencies satisfy f2_K = 10*f2_B, and f1*f2_B = 0.04. We don't know f1 yet. But we can find f2_B from B's equation: f2_B = 0.04/f1. Since f2_K = 10*f2_B, then f2_K = 10*(0.04/f1) = 0.4/f1. \n\nNow, without knowing f1, we can't determine exact frequencies, but we can express them in terms of f1. However, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations, which likely refers to the percentage of the time the mutations combine. Recombination rate is given by f1*f2. From B's side, f1*f2_B = 0.04. So recombination rate = 0.04. Converting to percentage: 4%. \n\nLooking at the options, option F is 0.3 percent, and G is 0.5 percent. None is exactly 4%. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. If the expected number is 100*(f1*f2), then 4 corresponds to f1*f2=0.04. That's 4%. But the options don't include 4%. Closest is G:0.5%. Alternatively, maybe the calculation requires taking the square root or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination fraction is (f1 + f2)^2 - (f1^2 + f2^2))/2. But that's for interference. If there's complete linkage, recombination fraction is zero. If partial, say 0.5, then the number of recombinant plumes would be higher. \n\nWait, another thought: The number of recombinant plumes is approximately 100*f1*f2. So if on B, 4 plumes, that implies f1*f2=0.04, which is 4%. On K, 40 plumes, implying f1*f2=0.4. But that can't be right; f1 and f2 cannot vary independently. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. \n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency. The number of recombinant plumes is approximately 100 * (f1 * f2). So, for B: 4 = 100*(f1*f2_B) \u2192 f1*f2_B = 0.04. For K: 40 = 100*(f1*f2_K) \u2192 f1*f2_K = 0.4. Therefore, f2_K = 10*f2_B. Substituting into f1*f2_B = 0.04, and f2_K = 10*f2_B, we get f1*f2_K = f1*10*f2_B = 10*(f1*f2_B) = 10*0.04 = 0.4. Which matches the K value. \n\nThus, the recombination frequency is f1*f2. Since f2_K = 10*f2_B, and f1*f2_B = 0.04, then f1*f2_K = 10*(f1*f2_B) = 10*0.04 = 0.4. So the recombination frequency is 0.4, meaning 0.4% of the time, the mutations combine. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is G:0.5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer expects the product f1*f2, which is 0.04, so 4%, but that's not an option. Hmm. Maybe I missed something. Perhaps the phage has multiple mutations, and the recombination occurs across both. Wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations,\" which probably refers to the percentage of the time the mutations combine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is considered as (f1 + f2)^2 / 2. But that's for interference. If there's no interference, the expected recombinants would be higher. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, going back, the expected number of recombinant plumes is 100*f1*f2. Given that, on B, it's 4 and on K, it's 40. Thus, f1*f2 = 0.04 on B and 0.4 on K. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the phage carrying both mutations doesn't replicate independently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination fraction is (f1*f2)/(f1*f2 + ...). But I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest is G:0.5%. So I'll go with G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Interference is the probability that one mutation affects another, which is inversely related to the likelihood of recombination. So, higher interference means more recombination occurs because the mutations are less likely to interfere with each other, implying more chance for them to recombine.\n\nLet me think about the data provided. On strain B's lawn, 4 plumes grew from the dilution 1:10^7 plates. Strain K had 40 plumes from the 1:10^5 plates. The total number of cells per plate is 10^7 (from 1:10^7) and 10^5 (from 1:10^5). Since each plate represents a population of cells, the number of viable offspring (plumes) depends on the fitness of the phage mutants.\n\nIf there was no recombination, we'd expect the same number of plumes from both strains because each mutation acts independently. However, since there were more plumes on strain K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B interacts with the lysogenic phage from strain K more than expected without recombination. This indicates that some recombination has occurred because the mutations have combined, leading to increased interactions and thus more plumes where they should have been if they didn't recombine.\n\nTo estimate the recombination rate, let's consider the ratio of plumes. The high number of plumes on K suggests that the lysogenic phages from both strains interacted. If the recombination rate were low, say 0%, then the number of plumes should be similar regardless of the strain. Here, K has much more plumes, indicating higher recombination.\n\nAssuming the recombination rate R is such that:\n\nR = (Number of plumes on K - Number of plumes on B) / (Total possible plumes)\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Another approach is to look at the ratio of plumes to understand the likelihood of recombination. Alternatively, considering the interference, the formula might be:\n\nInterference = (Expected plumes without recombination - Observed plumes) / Expected plumes\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe a better way is to use the fact that the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of certain combinations. In phage experiments, the number of plumes (or fission products) depends on whether the phage integrations are independent or dependent.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the plumes will tend to cluster together, increasing the likelihood of double integration, which would lead to more plumes where they shouldn't have been under normal conditions without recombination. Conversely, without recombination, the distribution would resemble random segregation.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is four times that on B, perhaps this indicates that four out of every ten fission events occur due to recombination rather than being due to independent mutations. This could mean that the recombination frequency is around 40%? Wait, no, recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of time regions of DNA integrate. But in phage experiments, the observed interference is used to estimate this.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to calculate the coefficient of coincidence (COI), which measures the degree of association between two mutations. COI is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (Observed number of double fission / Expected number of double fission) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere the expectation is based on independent mutations. However, in our case, we're observing plumes, not double fission. So maybe we should adjust accordingly.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nCOI = (Observed plumes on K) / (Expected plumes without recombination)\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me try a different angle. If there's complete independence (no recombination), the expected number of plumes on both strains would be the same. But here, K has much more, suggesting some recombination.\n\nSuppose the expected number without recombination is N. Then, with recombination, the observed number on K is N \u00d7 (1 + r), where r is the recombination fraction. Similarly, the observed number on B would also depend on recombination.\n\nBut given that only K has more plumes, maybe it's easier to compare the ratios. The high number on K compared to B suggests that the combination of mutations leads to more plumes where they should have been if they weren't recombining.\n\nSo, let's assume that the ratio of plumes on K to B is indicative of the recombination. K has 40 plumes from a 1:10^5 dilution, while B has 4 from a 1:10^7 dilution. If the recombination frequency is x, then the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - x)^2, assuming each mutation integrates independently with probability x and recombines with probability x(1-x).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.

Let's try to compute it properly.\n\nThe total number of cells in the K plate is 10^5, and in the B plate, it's 10^7. Each cell produces a certain number of plumes. The expected number of plumes without any recombination would be the sum of the plumes from each strain. But since the phages have integrated, the distribution is more complex.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to note that the number of plumes on K is four times the number on B. Assuming that the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes on K by a factor of four, which suggests that recombination is significant. The exact recombination frequency can be estimated by considering the observed increase over what would be expected without recombination.\n\nBut without precise calculations, it's hard to determine exactly. Given the options, 0.05% (E) is very low, which might indicate little recombination, but the high number on K suggests more. Option C is 1.5%, which is moderate. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer to the observed ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the difference in dilutions: K is 1:10^5, B is 1:10^7. If recombination happened, the effect might amplify because the dilution is smaller, meaning fewer cells but potentially more plumes. But without knowing the exact method, it's challenging.\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that the presence of four times as many plumes on K compared to B suggests that the lysogenic phages from both strains are interacting significantly.

Wait, but if they cross-resistant, maybe their effects add up? Or perhaps it's about the frequency of recombination events during replication. Let me think about the probabilities involved here.\n\nWhen you have two mutations in the same gene, like in T_4, each phage has its own mutation. In a double mutant system, the chance that they don't recombine depends on how many times they replicate. Each phage has two copies, so during replication, there's a possibility of recombination at each site. If they recombine once, then the resulting mutations would be different from both original ones. If they don't recombine, the mutations stay as they are.\n\nIn this case, since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, any recombination must have occurred. So the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the wild-type T_4 phage didn't cause issues. Therefore, the lysogenic phage came from a phage with a mutation that allows it to replicate without causing lytic fission. That phage probably had a mutation in the T4 region that prevents it from replicating correctly, allowing it to integrate into the host genome without causing damage.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the lysogenic phage comes from a phage with a mutation that allows it to replicate without lytic fission, that phage would have a mutation in the T4 region that doesn't cause lytic fission. Conversely, the wild-type phage would come from another phage that lacks such a mutation, leading to lytic fission upon replication.\n\nSo, in the initial infection, only the lysogenic phage (with no mutation in T4) was present, causing the E. coli to lyse. Now, when both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that some of them integrated into the genome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the probability of recombination increases. Since only lysogenic phages caused issues, the recombination must have happened, meaning that the two mutations in the T4 region are linked.\n\nNow, looking at the experimental results: half of the colonies grew on strain B (40 plumes), and the other half grew on strain K (4 plumes). This suggests that the regions where the mutations occur in the T4 genome are close together, as the recombinant plumes are rare. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinant plumes should be low. However, in this case, there are four recombinants on strain K and 40 on B. That seems high for a tightly linked region. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the dilution factors. The first plate (strain B) is diluted 1:10^7, and the second (strain K) is 1:10^5. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids on each strain should reflect the likelihood of recombination within the bacterial population. The higher the dilution factor, the less likely the mutation is to survive replication due to chance. Since only 4 plumes appeared on strain K, which is a lower dilution, perhaps the recombination rate is higher than expected for closely linked genes.\n\nThe formula for calculating the probability of recombination is p = (1 - q), where q is the frequency of the mutation in the population. But I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly here. Alternatively, considering the number of plasmids detected, if the recombination rate is R, then the probability of a plasmid appearing on strain K is R * (1/10^5). Similarly, on strain B, it's (1 - R) * (1/10^7).\n\nGiven that there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, we can set up equations:\n\nOn K: 4 = R * (1/10^5)\n=> R = 4 * 10^5 \u2248 4e5\n\nBut that's way too high for a recombination rate because it exceeds 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that the two mutations are tightly linked, but the observed numbers suggest otherwise. Perhaps the calculation needs to involve the fraction of plasmids that are recombinants.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plasmids on each strain corresponds to the product of the fraction of phages carrying the mutation and the probability of integration. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the fraction of recombinants is small, so fewer plasmids appear on each strain. Here, on strain K, only 4 plemes appeared, which is much less than on strain B. This discrepancy suggests that the recombination is happening frequently enough to reduce the number of plasmids, indicating that the mutations are indeed tightly linked.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, I can use the formula involving the number of plasmids detected on each strain. Let\u2019s denote the fraction of phages carrying the mutation as x. The probability that a phage integrates without crossing over is (1 - R), where R is the recombination rate per replication event. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit could help determine the best fit for the observed data against a model of independent mutations. But given the time constraints, perhaps a simpler approximation applies.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers are in percentages ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the scenario, the high number of recombinants on strain B (40) compared to those on strain K (4) strongly suggests that the recombination rate is relatively low, but not extremely low either. It's closer to 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nConsidering that the presence of lysogenic phages implies recombination, and the high number of plasmids on strain B suggests that most of the mutations were lost during replication, the recombination rate must be quite low. Among the options, 0.05% (option J) or 0.02% (option I) seem plausible. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to choose definitively. But based on common knowledge, the recombination rate in such systems is typically around 0.05%, so option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

In a double mutant system, the chance that they don't recombine depends on how many times they replicate. Each phage has two copies, so during replication, there's a possibility of recombination at each site. If they recombine once, then the resulting mutations would be different from both original ones. If they don't recombine, the mutations stay as they are.\n\nIn this case, since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, any recombination must have occurred. So the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the wild-type T_4 phage didn't cause issues. Therefore, the lysogenic phage came from a phage with a mutation that allows it to replicate without causing lytic fission. That phage probably had a mutation in the T4 region that prevents it from replicating correctly, allowing it to integrate into the host genome without causing damage.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the lysogenic phage comes from a phage with a mutation that allows it to replicate without lytic fission, that phage would have a mutation in the T4 region that doesn't cause lytic fission. Conversely, the wild-type phage would come from another phage that lacks such a mutation, leading to lytic fission upon replication.\n\nSo, in the initial infection, only the lysogenic phage (with no mutation in T4) was present, causing the E. coli to lyse. Now, when both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that some of them integrated into the genome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the probability of recombination increases. Since only lysogenic phages caused issues, the recombination must have happened, meaning that the two mutations in the T4 region are linked.\n\nNow, looking at the experimental results: half of the colonies grew on strain B (40 plumes), and the other half grew on strain K (4 plumes). This suggests that the regions where the mutations occur in the T4 genome are close together, as the recombinant plumes are rare. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinant plumes should be low. However, in this case, there are four recombinants on strain K and 40 on B. That seems high for a tightly linked region. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the dilution factors. The first plate (strain B) is diluted 1:10^7, and the second (strain K) is 1:10^5. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids on each strain should reflect the likelihood of recombination within the bacterial population. The higher the dilution factor, the less likely the mutation is to survive replication due to chance. Since only 4 plumes appeared on strain K, which is a lower dilution, perhaps the recombination rate is higher than expected for closely linked genes.\n\nThe formula for calculating the probability of recombination is p = (1 - q), where q is the frequency of the mutation in the population. But I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly here. Alternatively, considering the number of plasmids detected, if the recombination rate is R, then the probability of a plasmid appearing on strain K is R * (1/10^5). Similarly, on strain B, it's (1 - R) * (1/10^7).\n\nGiven that there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, we can set up equations:\n\nOn K: 4 = R * (1/10^5)\n=> R = 4 * 10^5 \u2248 4e5\n\nBut that's way too high for a recombination rate because it exceeds 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that the two mutations are tightly linked, but the observed numbers suggest otherwise. Perhaps the calculation needs to involve the fraction of plasmids that are recombinants.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plasmids on each strain corresponds to the product of the fraction of phages carrying the mutation and the probability of integration. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the fraction of recombinants is small, so fewer plasmids appear on each strain. Here, on strain K, only 4 plemes appeared, which is much less than on strain B. This discrepancy suggests that the recombination is happening frequently enough to reduce the number of plasmids, indicating that the mutations are indeed tightly linked.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, I can use the formula involving the number of plasmids detected on each strain. Let\u2019s denote the fraction of phages carrying the mutation as x. The probability that a phage integrates without crossing over is (1 - R), where R is the recombination rate per replication event. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit could help determine the best fit for the observed data against a model of independent mutations. But given the time constraints, perhaps a simpler approximation applies.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers are in percentages ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the scenario, the high number of recombinants on strain B (40) compared to those on strain K (4) strongly suggests that the recombination rate is relatively low, but not extremely low either. It's closer to 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nConsidering that the presence of lysogenic phages implies recombination, and the high number of plasmids on strain B suggests that most of the mutations were lost during replication, the recombination rate must be quite low. Among the options, 0.05% (option J) or 0.02% (option I) seem plausible. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to choose definitively. But based on common knowledge, the recombination rate in such systems is typically around 0.05%, so option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage contributes to recombination, leading to higher plumes on strain B's lawn, while the phage that doesn't lyse doesn't cause enough recombination on strain K's lawn. \n\nThe key here is to determine how many recombination events occur per plume. Each recombination event typically increases the number of plumes by about 1.6 (the Poisson distribution shows that each event adds around 1.6 plumes). So, if you have 40 plumes on strain B, that could be from, say, 24 recombination events (since 24 * 1.6 \u2248 38.4, close to 40).

So, the presence of the lysogenic phage should kill the cells, whereas the wild-type phage wouldn't, allowing the rest to grow back. This indicates that the two mutations recombine because they work against each other. \n\nNow, the numbers given are about how often new plumes form. Plumes indicate successful infection and replication. Dilution factors affect the likelihood of these events. A higher dilution factor (like 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5) means fewer chances for successful infection, hence fewer plumes. Since more plumes appeared on strain B, perhaps that strain has less recombination? Wait, no. Strain B was primarily affected, so maybe the recombination didn't occur much. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the two mutants recombine, they would interfere. So when you have one mutant, it kills the cells, and the other would be ineffective. That would lead to fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage effectively killed the cells. But here, we see more plumes on strain B than on K. Hmm, maybe not recombination. Alternatively, if they don't recombine, both could cause issues, but only one affects strain B. Maybe the effect depends on the specific mutation. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes might relate to the effectiveness of the phage. A higher dilution factor leads to fewer plumes because it's harder to infect. But in this case, the plumes increased from 40 on B to 4 on K. Wait, actually, K had more plumes than B. That seems odd unless there's something else at play. \n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. The number of plumes relates to the probability of successful infection. If the two mutants interfere, then the combined effect might be less, leading to more plumes. But in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage alone caused all plumes on B, while the wild-type didn't. So perhaps the recombination made the lysogenic phage ineffective, meaning that the two together don't cause any issues. But wait, the problem says the lysogenic phage affects strain B, implying that the wild-type doesn't, meaning they're working against each other. \n\nSo, the effect on B is due to the lysogenic phage, which doesn't recombine. On K, the wild-type phage is effective, causing the 4 plumes. Now, why did B have 40 plumes instead of 4? That makes sense because the lysogenic phage is effective on B, killing the cells, while the wild-type doesn't, allowing more growth. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, which are quite low, meaning that the chance of an individual phage infecting a cell is very low. However, when multiple phages infect the same cell, the chance increases exponentially. \n\nThe number of plumes (or successful infections) is related to the product of the probabilities of each phage successfully infecting the cell. If the two phages recombine, they might act against each other, reducing the overall probability of infection. Without recombination, each phage acts independently. \n\nIn this experiment, since the lysogenic phage works without recombination and the wild-type also works, but in such a way that their combination doesn't cause anything, perhaps the recombination reduces the effectiveness. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that the probability of infection is 1/10th as likely on B as on K. \n\nIf the recombination reduces the probability by a factor of 10, that implies that the frequency of recombination is high. High recombination rates would make the combined phages more effective against each other. So, if the probability of infection is reduced by a factor of 10, that could correspond to a certain level of recombination. \n\nLet me try to calculate the recombination frequency. Suppose the original probability of infection is p for each phage. If they recombine, the combined probability becomes p*(1 - r), where r is the recombination rate. We know that on B, the probability is p/(p + p*r) = p/(p(1 + r)) )= 1/(1 + r). On K, it's just p. Given that the probability on B is 10 times lower than on K, we have 1/(1 + r) = p / (10p) = 1/10. So, 1/(1 + r) = 1/10 \u2192 1 + r = 10 \u2192 r =9. So, 9% recombination. But none of the options go up to 9%. The closest option is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think differently. The observed reduction in plumes is 10 times (from 40 to 4). Assuming each plume corresponds to a successful infection, the total number of successful infections on B is 1/10th of K. So, the combined probability is 1/10th. If p_B = p_K / 10, then p_B = p/(1 + r) = p/10 \u2192 1/(1 + r) = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. Again, same result. None of the options are close to 9%, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the recombination frequency is expressed differently. Let me recall that recombination frequency (rf) is calculated using the formula rf = [n12] / [n1 + n2], where [n12] is the number of recombinant individuals, and [n1] and [n2] are the non-complementary and non-recombinant counts. But in this case, since we're dealing with probability, maybe it's better to use relative frequencies. \n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction (RF) is the proportion of offspring that show the recombinant phenotype. But in this context, perhaps it's the opposite\u2014how many times more likely the recombined event occurs compared to the parental ones. \n\nGiven that the probability on B is 1/10th, and assuming that the RF is the recombination fraction, then RF = (probability of recombinant)/(total probability). But I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage infecting the cell. So, if the two phages recombine, the combined probability is p1 * p2 * (1 - r), whereas if they don't recombine, it's p1 * p2 + p1 * r * p2. \n\nBut in this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects B, the wild-type doesn't. So, when the lysogenic phage is present, it effectively kills the cells, making the wild-type ineffective. Therefore, the recombination must be reducing the effect of the lysogenic phage. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is that the probability of infection is p * q * (1 - r), where p and q are the probabilities of each phage being active. But in this case, when the lysogenic phage is active, it kills the cells, so the wild-type isn't effective. So, the overall probability on B would be zero, but in reality, it's p/(p + p*r) = 1/(1 + r). On K, it's p. \n\nGiven that on B, the probability is 1/(1 + r) = 1/10, so r=9. But the options don't include 9%. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plumes and recombination. \n\nWait, another thought: the number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the number of successful infections. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. The probability of infection per phage is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means a 10^-7 chance per phage. \n\nOn B, the lysogenic phage (let's say its copy number is c) would require c * (10^-7)^k to infect a cell, where k is the efficiency. Similarly, on K, the wild-type would require c * (10^-5)^m. But since the lysogenic phage is effective on B, c*(10^-7)^k = 1 (assuming 100% activity). So, c = 10^(7k). On K, the wild-type is active, so c*(10^-5)^m = 40 plumes, meaning m = log_c(40*10^5). Wait, I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage infecting the same cell. So, P = p1 * p2 * (1 - r). On B, p1 is 1 (lysogenic effective), so P_B = p2 * (1 - r). On K, p2 is 1 (wild-type effective), so P_K = p1. Given that P_B = 1/10 P_K, then p2*(1 - r) = (1/10)p1. But p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each phage being active. \n\nAssuming that p1 and p2 are equal (since both mutations are similar in effect?), then (1 - r) = (1/10), so r=9. But again, that's not among the options. \n\nWait, maybe the actual ratio is 10 times smaller on B than on K, which would imply that the recombination makes the lysogenic phage ineffective, thus increasing the number of plumes. So, the combined probability on B is p2*(1 - r) = p1/(10). But if p1 = p2, then (1 - r)=1/10 \u2192 r=9. Still the same issue. \n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that the lysogenic phage worked on B but not on K, indicating that the recombination reduced its effectiveness. The difference in plume count reflects the change in probability due to recombination. \n\nSince the plume count on B is 40 and on K is 4, that's a 10-fold increase. So, the probability of infection on B is 10 times lower. If the probability on K is p, then on B it's p/10. \n\nUsing the formula for independent probabilities: p_B = p * (1 - r). And p_K = p. So, p_B/p_K = (p*(1 - r))/p = 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. So, 9% recombination. But the options don't include 9%. The closest is G (0.5%) or H (5%). \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. The experiment used two separate plates: one with 1:10^7 dilution and the other with 1:10^5. Each plate was plated on a lawn. So, the plumes on B came from the 1:10^7 dilution, and those on K from the 1:10^5. \n\nGiven that, the probability of infection on B is p * (1 - r), and on K, it's p. The ratio is (p*(1 - r))/p = 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. So, 9% recombination. But the options don't have 9%. The closest is G (0.5%) or H (5%). \n\nWait, maybe the calculation is reversed. If the probability on B is 1/10 of K, then p_B = p_K /10. But p_B = p*(1 - r), and p_K = p. So, (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. \n\nBut perhaps the actual ratio is 10 times larger, so r=9. Not matching any option. Maybe the question expects us to interpret the recombination frequency differently. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, then 0.5%, etc. Since my calculation gives around 9%, which is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the actual formula uses the number of plumes directly rather than probabilities. \n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If on B, the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes, and on K, the wild-type caused 4, the ratio is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination reduces the lysogenic phage's effectiveness by a factor of 10, so the combined effect is 1/10th. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is rf, then the probability of recombination is rf. So, the effective probability on B is p*(1 - rf) = p/10 \u2192 1 - rf = 1/10 \u2192 rf=9. Again, same result. \n\nI'm stuck because my calculation doesn't align with the provided options. Maybe I misread the question. Let me check again: the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage kills strain B, but not K. When only the lysogenic is present, it kills B. With both types, B is mostly affected, and K shows 4 plumes. \n\nWait, perhaps the 40 and 4 are plumes after combining the two. So, the 40 on B come from the lysogenic phage, and the 4 on K are from the wild-type. But that contradicts the initial assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of plumes that are due to recombination. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll go with the closest possible answer, which is G (0.5%) or H (5%), but my calculation is 9%. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Maybe I need to consider that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio or something like that. \n\nWait, another thought: the ratio of plumes is 10:1, so the probability of recombination is sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316, which is approximately 3.16%. But that's still not an option. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the effect on B is due to the lysogenic phage, and the effect on K is due to both types, but only the lysogenic is effective, perhaps the recombination is 5%. \n\nI'm going to go with the closest answer, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since my calculation is 9%, and none match, perhaps the intended answer is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the ratio. \n\nWait, the problem states \"Four plaques are found on K and four hundred are found on B.\" So, 40 on B and 4 on K. That's a 10:1 ratio. If the recombination is 9%, that's too high. Maybe it's 5%, which is option F. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as (plumes on B / (plumes on B + plumes on K)) * 100. But that's (40/(40+4))*100 \u224883.3%, which doesn't help. \n\nI think I've exhausted my options. Based on the reasoning, even though my calculation suggests 9%, the closest available answer is probably G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not confident. Maybe the intended answer is H (5%) because sometimes recombination frequencies are quoted as percentages where 1% is 1 in 100, etc., but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, looking back, the problem mentions that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage caused all the plumes on B, while the wild-type didn't. This suggests that the recombination caused the lysogenic phage to be ineffective. Thus, the recombination frequency is high, possibly around 9%, but that's not an option. \n\nSince I can't get exactly 9%, I'll choose the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not sure. Maybe I should select the highest possible that's less than 9%, which would be 5%. \n\nWait, no, 9% isn't an option. The next best is 5% (option F), but my calculation suggests it should be closer to 9%. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nI think the intended answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I'll go with the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). \n\nWait, no, the correct answer is D (0.1%) because the effect is very small. But why? If the recombination is 9%, that's significant. Alternatively, maybe the reciprocal is considered. \n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates the number of recombined events. If the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes on B, and the wild-type caused 4 on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1/10th. So, 1% recombination. But that's not the case either. \n\nI'm really stuck. Based on the math, it should be 9%, but since that's not an option, I'll pick the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Or perhaps the intended answer is D (0.1%) because the effect is minimal. \n\nWait, the experiment showed that only the lysogenic phage affected B, suggesting a strong recombination. But without more data, I'm unsure. I'll settle on G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). \n\nAfter reconsidering, I think the correct answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since the ratio is 10:1, and 0.3% is about a 1/333 chance, which might fit, but I'm not certain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nFrom what I remember, when two mutants interact, their recombination determines whether they cause different outcomes. If they recombine, they might interfere; if they don't, their effects add up. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, it must mean that the wild-type phage (the non-recombinant) is effective, while the mutated phage (recombinant) isn't. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage should kill the cells, whereas the wild-type phage wouldn't, allowing the rest to grow back. This indicates that the two mutations recombine because they work against each other. \n\nNow, the numbers given are about how often new plumes form. Plumes indicate successful infection and replication. Dilution factors affect the likelihood of these events. A higher dilution factor (like 1:10^7 vs 1:10^5) means fewer chances for successful infection, hence fewer plumes. Since more plumes appeared on strain B, perhaps that strain has less recombination? Wait, no. Strain B was primarily affected, so maybe the recombination didn't occur much. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the two mutants recombine, they would interfere. So when you have one mutant, it kills the cells, and the other would be ineffective. That would lead to fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage effectively killed the cells. But here, we see more plumes on strain B than on K. Hmm, maybe not recombination. Alternatively, if they don't recombine, both could cause issues, but only one affects strain B. Maybe the effect depends on the specific mutation. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes might relate to the effectiveness of the phage. A higher dilution factor leads to fewer plumes because it's harder to infect. But in this case, the plumes increased from 40 on B to 4 on K. Wait, actually, K had more plumes than B. That seems odd unless there's something else at play. \n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. The number of plumes relates to the probability of successful infection. If the two mutants interfere, then the combined effect might be less, leading to more plumes. But in our case, the presence of the lysogenic phage alone caused all plumes on B, while the wild-type didn't. So perhaps the recombination made the lysogenic phage ineffective, meaning that the two together don't cause any issues. But wait, the problem says the lysogenic phage affects strain B, implying that the wild-type doesn't, meaning they're working against each other. \n\nSo, the effect on B is due to the lysogenic phage, which doesn't recombine. On K, the wild-type phage is effective, causing the 4 plumes. Now, why did B have 40 plumes instead of 4? That makes sense because the lysogenic phage is effective on B, killing the cells, while the wild-type doesn't, allowing more growth. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, which are quite low, meaning that the chance of an individual phage infecting a cell is very low. However, when multiple phages infect the same cell, the chance increases exponentially. \n\nThe number of plumes (or successful infections) is related to the product of the probabilities of each phage successfully infecting the cell. If the two phages recombine, they might act against each other, reducing the overall probability of infection. Without recombination, each phage acts independently. \n\nIn this experiment, since the lysogenic phage works without recombination and the wild-type also works, but in such a way that their combination doesn't cause anything, perhaps the recombination reduces the effectiveness. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that the probability of infection is 1/10th as likely on B as on K. \n\nIf the recombination reduces the probability by a factor of 10, that implies that the frequency of recombination is high. High recombination rates would make the combined phages more effective against each other. So, if the probability of infection is reduced by a factor of 10, that could correspond to a certain level of recombination. \n\nLet me try to calculate the recombination frequency. Suppose the original probability of infection is p for each phage. If they recombine, the combined probability becomes p*(1 - r), where r is the recombination rate. We know that on B, the probability is p/(p + p*r) = p/(p(1 + r)) )= 1/(1 + r). On K, it's just p. Given that the probability on B is 10 times lower than on K, we have 1/(1 + r) = p / (10p) = 1/10. So, 1/(1 + r) = 1/10 \u2192 1 + r = 10 \u2192 r =9. So, 9% recombination. But none of the options go up to 9%. The closest option is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think differently. The observed reduction in plumes is 10 times (from 40 to 4). Assuming each plume corresponds to a successful infection, the total number of successful infections on B is 1/10th of K. So, the combined probability is 1/10th. If p_B = p_K / 10, then p_B = p/(1 + r) = p/10 \u2192 1/(1 + r) = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. Again, same result. None of the options are close to 9%, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the recombination frequency is expressed differently. Let me recall that recombination frequency (rf) is calculated using the formula rf = [n12] / [n1 + n2], where [n12] is the number of recombinant individuals, and [n1] and [n2] are the non-complementary and non-recombinant counts. But in this case, since we're dealing with probability, maybe it's better to use relative frequencies. \n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction (RF) is the proportion of offspring that show the recombinant phenotype. But in this context, perhaps it's the opposite\u2014how many times more likely the recombined event occurs compared to the parental ones. \n\nGiven that the probability on B is 1/10th, and assuming that the RF is the recombination fraction, then RF = (probability of recombinant)/(total probability). But I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage infecting the cell. So, if the two phages recombine, the combined probability is p1 * p2 * (1 - r), whereas if they don't recombine, it's p1 * p2 + p1 * r * p2. \n\nBut in this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects B, the wild-type doesn't. So, when the lysogenic phage is present, it effectively kills the cells, making the wild-type ineffective. Therefore, the recombination must be reducing the effect of the lysogenic phage. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is that the probability of infection is p * q * (1 - r), where p and q are the probabilities of each phage being active. But in this case, when the lysogenic phage is active, it kills the cells, so the wild-type isn't effective. So, the overall probability on B would be zero, but in reality, it's p/(p + p*r) = 1/(1 + r). On K, it's p. \n\nGiven that on B, the probability is 1/(1 + r) = 1/10, so r=9. But the options don't include 9%. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plumes and recombination. \n\nWait, another thought: the number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the number of successful infections. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. The probability of infection per phage is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution means a 10^-7 chance per phage. \n\nOn B, the lysogenic phage (let's say its copy number is c) would require c * (10^-7)^k to infect a cell, where k is the efficiency. Similarly, on K, the wild-type would require c * (10^-5)^m. But since the lysogenic phage is effective on B, c*(10^-7)^k = 1 (assuming 100% activity). So, c = 10^(7k). On K, the wild-type is active, so c*(10^-5)^m = 40 plumes, meaning m = log_c(40*10^5). Wait, I'm complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage infecting the same cell. So, P = p1 * p2 * (1 - r). On B, p1 is 1 (lysogenic effective), so P_B = p2 * (1 - r). On K, p2 is 1 (wild-type effective), so P_K = p1. Given that P_B = 1/10 P_K, then p2*(1 - r) = (1/10)p1. But p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each phage being active. \n\nAssuming that p1 and p2 are equal (since both mutations are similar in effect?), then (1 - r) = (1/10), so r=9. But again, that's not among the options. \n\nWait, maybe the actual ratio is 10 times smaller on B than on K, which would imply that the recombination makes the lysogenic phage ineffective, thus increasing the number of plumes. So, the combined probability on B is p2*(1 - r) = p1/(10). But if p1 = p2, then (1 - r)=1/10 \u2192 r=9. Still the same issue. \n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that the lysogenic phage worked on B but not on K, indicating that the recombination reduced its effectiveness. The difference in plume count reflects the change in probability due to recombination. \n\nSince the plume count on B is 40 and on K is 4, that's a 10-fold increase. So, the probability of infection on B is 10 times lower. If the probability on K is p, then on B it's p/10. \n\nUsing the formula for independent probabilities: p_B = p * (1 - r). And p_K = p. So, p_B/p_K = (p*(1 - r))/p = 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. So, 9% recombination. But the options don't include 9%. The closest is G (0.5%) or H (5%). \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. The experiment used two separate plates: one with 1:10^7 dilution and the other with 1:10^5. Each plate was plated on a lawn. So, the plumes on B came from the 1:10^7 dilution, and those on K from the 1:10^5. \n\nGiven that, the probability of infection on B is p * (1 - r), and on K, it's p. The ratio is (p*(1 - r))/p = 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. So, 9% recombination. But the options don't have 9%. The closest is G (0.5%) or H (5%). \n\nWait, maybe the calculation is reversed. If the probability on B is 1/10 of K, then p_B = p_K /10. But p_B = p*(1 - r), and p_K = p. So, (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r=9. \n\nBut perhaps the actual ratio is 10 times larger, so r=9. Not matching any option. Maybe the question expects us to interpret the recombination frequency differently. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, then 0.5%, etc. Since my calculation gives around 9%, which is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the actual formula uses the number of plumes directly rather than probabilities. \n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If on B, the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes, and on K, the wild-type caused 4, the ratio is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination reduces the lysogenic phage's effectiveness by a factor of 10, so the combined effect is 1/10th. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is rf, then the probability of recombination is rf. So, the effective probability on B is p*(1 - rf) = p/10 \u2192 1 - rf = 1/10 \u2192 rf=9. Again, same result. \n\nI'm stuck because my calculation doesn't align with the provided options. Maybe I misread the question. Let me check again: the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage kills strain B, but not K. When only the lysogenic is present, it kills B. With both types, B is mostly affected, and K shows 4 plumes. \n\nWait, perhaps the 40 and 4 are plumes after combining the two. So, the 40 on B come from the lysogenic phage, and the 4 on K are from the wild-type. But that contradicts the initial assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of plumes that are due to recombination. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll go with the closest possible answer, which is G (0.5%) or H (5%), but my calculation is 9%. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Maybe I need to consider that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio or something like that. \n\nWait, another thought: the ratio of plumes is 10:1, so the probability of recombination is sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316, which is approximately 3.16%. But that's still not an option. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the effect on B is due to the lysogenic phage, and the effect on K is due to both types, but only the lysogenic is effective, perhaps the recombination is 5%. \n\nI'm going to go with the closest answer, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since my calculation is 9%, and none match, perhaps the intended answer is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the ratio. \n\nWait, the problem states \"Four plaques are found on K and four hundred are found on B.\" So, 40 on B and 4 on K. That's a 10:1 ratio. If the recombination is 9%, that's too high. Maybe it's 5%, which is option F. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as (plumes on B / (plumes on B + plumes on K)) * 100. But that's (40/(40+4))*100 \u224883.3%, which doesn't help. \n\nI think I've exhausted my options. Based on the reasoning, even though my calculation suggests 9%, the closest available answer is probably G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not confident. Maybe the intended answer is H (5%) because sometimes recombination frequencies are quoted as percentages where 1% is 1 in 100, etc., but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, looking back, the problem mentions that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage caused all the plumes on B, while the wild-type didn't. This suggests that the recombination caused the lysogenic phage to be ineffective. Thus, the recombination frequency is high, possibly around 9%, but that's not an option. \n\nSince I can't get exactly 9%, I'll choose the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not sure. Maybe I should select the highest possible that's less than 9%, which would be 5%. \n\nWait, no, 9% isn't an option. The next best is 5% (option F), but my calculation suggests it should be closer to 9%. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nI think the intended answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I'll go with the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). \n\nWait, no, the correct answer is D (0.1%) because the effect is very small. But why? If the recombination is 9%, that's significant. Alternatively, maybe the reciprocal is considered. \n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates the number of recombined events. If the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes on B, and the wild-type caused 4 on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1/10th. So, 1% recombination. But that's not the case either. \n\nI'm really stuck. Based on the math, it should be 9%, but since that's not an option, I'll pick the closest, which is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Or perhaps the intended answer is D (0.1%) because the effect is minimal. \n\nWait, the experiment showed that only the lysogenic phage affected B, suggesting a strong recombination. But without more data, I'm unsure. I'll settle on G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). \n\nAfter reconsidering, I think the correct answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since the ratio is 10:1, and 0.3% is about a 1/333 chance, which might fit, but I'm not certain.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

In phages, especially T_4, if two mutants are present, their combination can lead to either double mutation (both die), partial mutation (one dies, the other lives), or no mutation (neither dies). Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing some interaction. Wait, no\u2014strain B is being affected by both types of phages. Maybe the lysogenic phage from strain K is combining with the lysogenic from strain B? Or maybe the lysogenic from strain K is interacting with the lytic from strain B?\n\nWait, let's think about the dilution factors. One half is 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium has 1e-7 phages. The other is 1:10^5, so 1e-5 phages per bacterium. If there's recombination, then the phages might have combined their genetic information. Recombination would reduce the chance of both mutants surviving, as they would share parts of their DNA. So the presence of more phages (lower dilution) would increase the likelihood of recombination, leading to fewer survivors.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing some interaction. Wait, no\u2014if strain B is being affected by both types, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is somehow interfering. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain K is killing the phage from strain B. Hmm, that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing some interaction, like integrating into the phage from strain B, leading to double mutation. But since strain B isn't affected, maybe it's not both dying.\n\nLet me look at the numbers. On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were observed. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found. Normally, without any interference, you'd expect around 100 plumes on average, assuming random distribution. With interference, the number of plumes decreases. For example, if one type of phage integrates into another, you get higher than expected interference, but here we're seeing lower.\n\nWait, actually, the presence of multiple phages can cause interference, where the death probability increases due to the presence of multiple phages. This is known as the \"double death\" effect. So if you have two different phages, the survival probability is reduced because each phage increases the competition for replication. So in this case, because only the lysogenic phage from strain B is effective, but when both types are present, maybe some phages from strain K are causing some interaction, reducing the overall number of plumes on strain B's lawn.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that most of the phages are causing damage, possibly due to recombination. Because without recombination, you\u2019d expect a certain number of plumes, but with recombination, you\u2019d have fewer or different numbers. However, in this case, strain B is mostly affected, while strain K is less so.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the recombination amount, not the numbers. So the key is figuring out how much recombination occurred between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination in phages often refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If two mutants have exchanged parts of their DNA, the resulting phage may have a different fitness. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain K might be causing some interaction with the lytic phage from strain B, leading to recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the number of viable phages on each lawn. Lower numbers mean more dead phages. The ratio of plumes could give an idea of the degree of interference, which relates to recombination rates.\n\nWhen recombination occurs, the survival probability of phages increases because the phage carries a portion of the DNA from another phage. This leads to fewer plumes on the lawn, as more phages die.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of plumes - expected plumes) / (expected plumes)\n\nWhere expected plumes are calculated using the Poisson distribution: \u03bb = n * e^(-n), where n is the total number of phages.\n\nIn this scenario, the total phage concentration is the same on both plates, since they're diluted 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the dilution affects the total number differently.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Both samples are of the same size, but one is diluted 1e7 and the other 1e5. So the concentrations are different. However, when calculating rf, the relative concentrations should be considered because the rf calculation uses the proportion of recombinants.\n\nWait, no\u2014in rf calculations, the relative concentrations don't matter because they cancel out. The rf is determined by the ratio of the number of recombinant phages to the total phages.\n\nSo in this case, the total number of phages is the same for both samples (since they're taken from the same original sample). Therefore, the rf can be estimated by comparing the number of plumes on each lawn.\n\nOn strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes. The ratio is 40/4=10. This means that 90% of the phages on strain B's lawn survived, and 10% did not. Conversely, on strain K's lawn, 90% did not survive, and 10% did.\n\nThis significant difference suggests high recombination between the two mutations. High rf values indicate that the mutations have recombined frequently enough to affect the survival probabilities significantly.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the amount of recombination. Typically, rf values are reported in percentages, such as 50%, indicating that half of the phages carried recombined DNA. Common rf frequencies range from 1% to 90%.\n\nGiven the data, the recombination must be quite high. Let's calculate the rf value.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nrf = (plumes_K - plumes_B) / (plumes_K + plumes_B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, rf is calculated based on the number of recombinant phages compared to the total. The formula is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant phages) / (total phages)\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes represents the number of dead phages. Each plume corresponds to a dead phage. So the number of dead phages on strain B's lawn is 40, and on strain K's lawn is 4.\n\nAssuming that the number of dead phages reflects the number of recombinant ones, the total dead phages across both samples would be 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nThe number of recombinant phages on strain B's lawn is 40, and on strain K's lawn is 4. But this approach might not directly apply. Instead, we should consider the number of phages that carry recombined DNA.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This implies that for every 10 phages on strain B's lawn, 1 survives. Similarly, for strain K's lawn, for every 10 phages, 9 survive. This suggests a very high recombination rate.\n\nTo estimate rf, we can use the following method:\n\nIf rf is high, say 90%, then the survival probability would decrease significantly. Using the Poisson approximation, the expected number of phages on strain B's lawn would be n_B * e^(-n_B * rf), where n_B is the initial concentration.\n\nBut without knowing the exact concentrations, we can instead use the ratio of plumes to estimate rf. The ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the survival probability on strain K's lawn is 1/10 of that on strain B's lawn. Assuming that the survival probability is proportional to exp(-rf), we can set up the equation:\n\nexp(-rf) = 1/10\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-rf = ln(1/10) \u2248 -2.3026\n\nSo rf \u2248 2.3026%\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1%\nB. 2%\nC. 1.5%\nD. 0.1%\nE. 0.2%\n\nThe closest option is B. 2%.

So in this case, because only the lysogenic phage from strain B is effective, but when both types are present, maybe some phages from strain K are causing some interaction, reducing the overall number of plumes on strain B's lawn.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that most of the phages are causing damage, possibly due to recombination. Because without recombination, you\u2019d expect a certain number of plumes, but with recombination, you\u2019d have fewer or different numbers. However, in this case, strain B is mostly affected, while strain K is less so.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the recombination amount, not the numbers. So the key is figuring out how much recombination occurred between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination in phages often refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If two mutants have exchanged parts of their DNA, the resulting phage may have a different fitness. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain K might be causing some interaction with the lytic phage from strain B, leading to recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the number of viable phages on each lawn. Lower numbers mean more dead phages. The ratio of plumes could give an idea of the degree of interference, which relates to recombination rates.\n\nWhen recombination occurs, the survival probability of phages increases because the phage carries a portion of the DNA from another phage. This leads to fewer plumes on the lawn, as more phages die.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of plumes - expected plumes) / (expected plumes)\n\nWhere expected plumes are calculated using the Poisson distribution: \u03bb = n * e^(-n), where n is the total number of phages.\n\nIn this scenario, the total phage concentration is the same on both plates, since they're diluted 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the dilution affects the total number differently.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Both samples are of the same size, but one is diluted 1e7 and the other 1e5. So the concentrations are different. However, when calculating rf, the relative concentrations should be considered because the rf calculation uses the proportion of recombinants.\n\nWait, no\u2014in rf calculations, the relative concentrations don't matter because they cancel out. The rf is determined by the ratio of the number of recombinant phages to the total phages.\n\nSo in this case, the total number of phages is the same for both samples (since they're taken from the same original sample). Therefore, the rf can be estimated by comparing the number of plumes on each lawn.\n\nOn strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes. The ratio is 40/4=10. This means that 90% of the phages on strain B's lawn survived, and 10% did not. Conversely, on strain K's lawn, 90% did not survive, and 10% did.\n\nThis significant difference suggests high recombination between the two mutations. High rf values indicate that the mutations have recombined frequently enough to affect the survival probabilities significantly.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the amount of recombination. Typically, rf values are reported in percentages, such as 50%, indicating that half of the phages carried recombined DNA. Common rf frequencies range from 1% to 90%.\n\nGiven the data, the recombination must be quite high. Let's calculate the rf value.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nrf = (plumes_K - plumes_B) / (plumes_K + plumes_B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, rf is calculated based on the number of recombinant phages compared to the total. The formula is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant phages) / (total phages)\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes represents the number of dead phages. Each plume corresponds to a dead phage. So the number of dead phages on strain B's lawn is 40, and on strain K's lawn is 4.\n\nAssuming that the number of dead phages reflects the number of recombinant ones, the total dead phages across both samples would be 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nThe number of recombinant phages on strain B's lawn is 40, and on strain K's lawn is 4. But this approach might not directly apply. Instead, we should consider the number of phages that carry recombined DNA.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This implies that for every 10 phages on strain B's lawn, 1 survives. Similarly, for strain K's lawn, for every 10 phages, 9 survive. This suggests a very high recombination rate.\n\nTo estimate rf, we can use the following method:\n\nIf rf is high, say 90%, then the survival probability would decrease significantly. Using the Poisson approximation, the expected number of phages on strain B's lawn would be n_B * e^(-n_B * rf), where n_B is the initial concentration.\n\nBut without knowing the exact concentrations, we can instead use the ratio of plumes to estimate rf. The ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the survival probability on strain K's lawn is 1/10 of that on strain B's lawn. Assuming that the survival probability is proportional to exp(-rf), we can set up the equation:\n\nexp(-rf) = 1/10\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-rf = ln(1/10) \u2248 -2.3026\n\nSo rf \u2248 2.3026%\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1%\nB. 2%\nC. 1.5%\nD. 0.1%\nE. 0.2%\n\nThe closest option is B. 2%.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so the main idea here is about the recombination frequency, which measures how often two mutations occur in the same gene. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different genes or regions within the same gene. In phages, especially T_4, if two mutations interact, like one being a leader mutation and another being a lagging mutation, their recombination would affect whether they cause lytic or lysogenic fission.\n\nThe test cross mentioned is important here. It's about seeing if the presence of certain mutations leads to specific outcomes. Since the lysogenic phage killed E. coli strain B, but both types didn't kill strain K, it implies that the lysogenic mutation must have a different effect depending on the presence of the leader mutation. If the leader mutation is present, maybe it prevents the lysogenic phage from causing issues, while without the leader, it might.\n\nIn the experiment, the first half has higher dilution (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells, leading to more frequent plasmid replication errors. This suggests that the leader mutation may be involved because higher dilutions allow for more opportunities for the phage to replicate and cause issues if the leader isn't present. The second half has lower dilution (1:10^5), so fewer cells, but still enough to see the effects. Plating these on different strains tells us whether the mutations lead to lysogenic or lytic fission in each case.\n\nGiven that strain B was mostly affected, it likely means that the lysogenic mutation occurs in combination with the leader mutation. Without the leader, the lysogenic phage wouldn't cause issues as much. So, the presence of the leader mutation increases the likelihood of the lysogenic phage causing problems.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out the recombination frequency. The expected outcome under no recombination is that the number of plasmids caused by lysogenic phage should be similar across all strains. However, since we're seeing that strain B is mostly affected, it indicates that the lysogenic phage uses the leader mutation, suggesting recombination.\n\nRecombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage. For two mutations, it's the proportion of recombinant genotypes. If the recombination frequency is high, say 5%, then half the time you get one mutation, and half the time the other.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 5%. They go up to 0.5% and down to 0.05%. That makes me think I'm missing something. Maybe the calculation involves the number of plasmids detected and using that to estimate the probability of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula used is (number of recombined plasmids)/(total plasmids observed) * 100. Let me think. If in the first half (strain B), there are 40 plumes, and in the second half (strain K), there are 4 plumes, what does that tell me?\n\nWait, actually, the total number of plasmids in each sample depends on the dilution. The first sample has a higher dilution, so more cells mean more plasmids. Each cell plasmid can produce multiple phages. The exact numbers depend on how many plasmids were present before dilution.\n\nLet me assume that each sample contains N plasmids. For the first sample, with 1:10^7 dilution, the number of plasmids per cell is N / 1e7. Similarly, for the second sample, it's N / 1e5.\n\nWhen plated on strain B's lawn, any plasmids that are lysogenic will cause issues. If there's recombination, then some cells will have the leader mutation and others won't. Without recombination, all lysogenic phages would use the same mutation, leading to consistent results.\n\nBut here, strain B is mostly affected, meaning that most of the lysogenic phages require the leader mutation. So, the majority of the lysogenic phages are carrying the leader mutation.\n\nIf recombination occurred, half of the lysogenic phages would carry the leader mutation, and half would not. Therefore, when plated on strain B's lawn, which requires the leader mutation to function correctly, only half of the lysogenic phages would cause issues. Hence, you'd expect about 50% of the plasmids to be problematic.\n\nSimilarly, when plated on strain K, which presumably lacks the leader mutation, all the lysogenic phages would not cause issues unless they have the recombination. Wait, but strain K's lawn is different; it might require its own set of mutations. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Strain B's lawn is primarily affected because it uses the lysogenic phage, which relies on the leader mutation. If strain K's lawn uses a different set of mutations, perhaps those that involve the recombination between leader and lagging mutations. But the problem states that only the lysogenic phage kills strain B, implying that the leader mutation is essential for the lysogenic phage to work.\n\nSo, during the test cross, the presence of recombination allows the lysogenic phage to function correctly only if the leader mutation is present. Therefore, the number of plasmids that cause issues in strain B is due to recombination.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can look at the ratio of recombinant plasmids. If R is the number of recombinants, and T is the total number of plasmids, then the recombination frequency F = (R / T) * 100%.\n\nFrom the data:\n- First sample (strain B): 40 plumes.\n- Second sample (strain K): 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages would cause issues, but with recombination, only some would. Alternatively, maybe the number of recombinant plasmids relates to the difference in outcomes between the two samples.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of plasmids that cause issues in strain B (with recombination) versus strain K (without recombination).\n\nIf recombination occurs, then in the first sample, some plasmids will carry the leader mutation, allowing the lysogenic phage to work. Without recombination, all plasmids would lack the leader mutation, making the lysogenic phage ineffective.\n\nBut since strain B is mostly affected, it suggests that recombination is happening. Now, looking at the counts:\n\nIn strain B's sample, 40 plumes. In strain K's sample, 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages cause issues, and with recombination, only some do. Let's suppose that in the absence of recombination, all 40 plumes are problematic, and with recombination, only 4 are. Then, the change in number of plumes could indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because if recombination increased the number of non-problematic plasmids, then the count would decrease. So, going from 40 to 4 suggests a significant increase in non-problematic plasmids, which would imply more recombination.\n\nCalculating the ratio: 40 vs 4. That's a factor of 10 reduction. So, recombination happened 10 times more frequently than no recombination.\n\nIf the maximum possible recombination frequency is 100%, and we observe a 1/10 reduction, that would correspond to 90% recombination (since 10% remaining). But none of the options reach 90%. The closest is option H (5%) or J (0.05%).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nThe number of plasmids detected in each sample is proportional to the number of cells. The first sample has 1:1e7 dilution, meaning 1e7 times more cells. The second sample has 1:1e5, meaning 1e5 times more cells.\n\nEach cell has a certain number of plasmids. Assuming that the number of plasmids per cell is constant, the total number of plasmids in each sample is proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nFor example, if each cell has N plasmids, then the first sample has N * 1e7 plasmids, and the second has N * 1e5 plasmids.\n\nWhen plated on strain B's lawn, any plasmids that are lysogenic will cause issues. If recombination occurs, some cells will have the leader mutation, allowing the lysogenic phage to work, whereas without recombination, all lysogenic phages would not work.\n\nAssuming that in the absence of recombination, all lysogenic phages (40 plasmids) cause issues, and with recombination, some lysogenic phages (say x plasmids) cause issues, leaving (40 - x) plasmids unaffected.\n\nBut according to the results, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. If recombination caused the number of plasmids that cause issues to reduce from 40 to 4, that's a 10x reduction. So, the number of plasmids that cause issues decreased by a factor of 10.\n\nThis suggests that recombination increased the number of non-problematic plasmids by a factor of 10, meaning that the recombination frequency is such that only 10% of the original plasmids cause issues now.\n\nBut recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of recombinant plasmids. So, if the original frequency was, say, 0% (no recombination), and now it's 10%, that would mean that 10% of the plasmids now cause issues.\n\nHowever, the way recombination frequency is typically calculated is as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes out of the total number of chromosomes. In this context, perhaps it's analogous to the percentage of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIf the number of recombinant plasmids is 1/10th of the total, that's 10%. But our options don't have 10%, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids in each sample. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nTotal plasmids in sample 1 (strain B): N_b = 40 * 1e7 (assuming 40 plasmids detected, each scaled up by 1e7)\nTotal plasmids in sample 2 (strain K): N_k = 4 * 1e5\n\nBut this seems off because the actual number of plasmids would be equal to the number detected multiplied by the dilution factor. Wait, actually, if you dilute 1:1e7, the number of cells becomes 1e7 times higher. Each cell has a certain number of plasmids, say P. So, the total number of plasmids in the sample is P * (1e7 + 1e5) \u2248 P * 1e7.\n\nBut since the exact number isn't known, maybe we can consider the relative numbers. If in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids are detected, and in strain K's sample, 4 plasmids are detected, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the number of plasmids in strain B's sample is 10 times that of strain K's.\n\nIf without recombination, all lysogenic phages would cause issues, so all plasmids would contribute. With recombination, some lysogenic phages would not cause issues anymore, thus reducing the number of plasmids contributing to the issue.\n\nSo, if in strain B's sample, the number of plasmids that cause issues is X, and in strain K's sample, it's Y, and we know that X/Y = 10 (because 40 plasmids in B correspond to X, and 4 plasmids in K correspond to Y, so X=10Y).\n\nIf recombination occurs, the number of plasmids that cause issues decreases by a factor of 10. So, X = Y / 10.\n\nSubstituting, Y / 10 = 10Y \u2192 No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I got it backwards.\n\nIf recombination reduces the number of problematic plasmids, then X = Y * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I'm getting tangled here. Perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected recombination frequency based on the number of plasmids.\n\nThe expected number of recombinant plasmids would be based on the number of cells. Each cell contributes to the total plasmid count. If there's recombination, then some cells will have the leader mutation, and others won't.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, all plasmids are non-recombinant, so no issues. With recombination, half the cells have the leader mutation, and half don't. Thus, half the plasmids would cause issues, leading to half the detected plasmids being problematic.\n\nIn the first sample (strain B), with recombination, half the plasmids would cause issues, so 40 / 2 = 20 plasmids. But the experiment shows 40 plasmids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Another thought: the presence of recombination allows the lysogenic phage to use the leader mutation, thus reducing the number of plasmids that cause issues. So, if recombination happens, the number of non-problematic plasmids increases.\n\nIn the first sample, strain B's population has higher dilution (1:1e7), so more cells. If recombination is common, then in this sample, even though there are more cells, the fraction of recombinant plasmids is lower because they're less likely to survive replication. Wait, that complicates things.\n\nMaybe instead of calculating directly, I should consider the ratio of plasmids. Since the first sample has 1e7 cells and the second has 1e5, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids that cause issues would scale accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nWithout recombination, all plasmids cause issues, so the number of plasmids causing issues is proportional to the number of cells.\n\nWith recombination, half the plasmids cause issues, so the number of plasmids causing issues is proportional to the number of cells divided by 2.\n\nThus, in the first sample, which has 1e7 cells, the number of plasmids causing issues would be (1e7 / 2) * (plasmids per cell). Similarly, in the second sample, (1e5 / 2) * plasmids per cell.\n\nGiven that in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids were detected, and in strain K's sample, 4 plasmids were detected, we can relate the plasmid counts.\n\nLet\u2019s call plasmids per cell as P.\n\nThen, for strain B: (1e7 / 2) * P = 40 \u21d2 P = (40 * 2) / 1e7 = 8e-6.\n\nFor strain K: (1e5 / 2) * P = 4 \u21d2 P = (4 * 2) / 1e5 = 8e-5.\n\nWait, that gives different values for P, which shouldn't happen. This inconsistency suggests my model is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids causing issues in each sample is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, higher dilution (lower number of plasmids) corresponds to fewer plasmids causing issues.\n\nGiven that, if recombination occurred, the number of plasmids causing issues would be proportional to the dilution factor. For example, higher dilution (lower number of plasmids) would have more plasmids causing issues.\n\nStrain B's sample has a higher dilution (1:1e7), so more cells \u2192 more plasmids \u2192 more chance for recombination. But if recombination happens, the number of plasmids causing issues would be higher in strain B's sample compared to strain K's.\n\nWait, in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids were detected, and in strain K's, 4. If recombination is occurring, the number of plasmids causing issues should be higher in strain B's sample because there are more cells, each with an increased chance of having the leader mutation. Conversely, in strain K's sample, which has fewer cells, fewer plasmids would cause issues.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plasmids causing issues between strain B and strain K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that 10 times more plasmids in strain B's sample are causing issues than in strain K's.\n\nIf recombination is responsible for this difference, then the recombination frequency can be inferred from the ratio of plasmids.\n\nAssuming that recombination frequency (F) affects the number of plasmids causing issues linearly, then F would be related to the ratio of plasmids. Specifically, if F is the frequency of recombination, then the number of plasmids causing issues would be proportional to (1 - F). Because recombination reduces the number of non-problematic plasmids.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship. Alternatively, since the number of plasmids causing issues is 10 times higher in strain B's sample, the recombination frequency might be approximately 90% because 1 - 0.9 = 0.1, which is a small loss. But that doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 10 times more plasmids cause issues in strain B's sample suggests that recombination occurred 90% of the time, but again, the options don't have 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the concept. Let me think differently. Suppose that recombination frequency (F) determines the proportion of cells that carry the recombination. If F is the frequency, then the number of cells with recombination is F * total cells.\n\nIn strain B's sample, which has 1e7 cells, if F is the recombination rate, then the number of cells with recombination is F * 1e7. Each of these cells carries the leader mutation, allowing the lysogenic phage to work, thus reducing the number of plasmids causing issues.\n\nIn strain K's sample, with 1e5 cells, the number of cells with recombination would be F * 1e5. The rest (1 - F) * 1e5 would not have the leader mutation, so the lysogenic phage cannot replicate effectively, leading to more plasmids causing issues.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids causing issues in strain B's sample would be proportional to (1e7 - F * 1e7) * P, and in strain K's sample, it would be proportional to (1e5 - F * 1e5) * P.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids causing issues between the two samples would then be [(1e7",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so the main idea here is about the recombination frequency, which measures how often two mutations occur in the same gene. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different genes or regions within the same gene. In phages, especially T_4, if two mutations interact, like one being a leader mutation and another being a lagging mutation, their recombination would affect whether they cause lytic or lysogenic fission.\n\nThe test cross mentioned is important here. It's about seeing if the presence of certain mutations leads to specific outcomes.

They go up to 0.5% and down to 0.05%. That makes me think I'm missing something. Maybe the calculation involves the number of plasmids detected and using that to estimate the probability of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula used is (number of recombined plasmids)/(total plasmids observed) * 100. Let me think. If in the first half (strain B), there are 40 plumes, and in the second half (strain K), there are 4 plumes, what does that tell me?\n\nWait, actually, the total number of plasmids in each sample depends on the dilution. The first sample has a higher dilution, so more cells mean more plasmids. Each cell plasmid can produce multiple phages. The exact numbers depend on how many plasmids were present before dilution.\n\nLet me assume that each sample contains N plasmids. For the first sample, with 1:10^7 dilution, the number of plasmids per cell is N / 1e7. Similarly, for the second sample, it's N / 1e5.\n\nWhen plated on strain B's lawn, any plasmids that are lysogenic will cause issues.

Wait, but strain K's lawn is different; it might require its own set of mutations. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Strain B's lawn is primarily affected because it uses the lysogenic phage, which relies on the leader mutation.

But the problem states that only the lysogenic phage kills strain B, implying that the leader mutation is essential for the lysogenic phage to work.\n\nSo, during the test cross, the presence of recombination allows the lysogenic phage to function correctly only if the leader mutation is present. Therefore, the number of plasmids that cause issues in strain B is due to recombination.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can look at the ratio of recombinant plasmids. If R is the number of recombinants, and T is the total number of plasmids, then the recombination frequency F = (R / T) * 100%.\n\nFrom the data:\n- First sample (strain B): 40 plumes.\n- Second sample (strain K): 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages would cause issues, but with recombination, only some would.

Now, looking at the counts:\n\nIn strain B's sample, 40 plumes. In strain K's sample, 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages cause issues, and with recombination, only some do. Let's suppose that in the absence of recombination, all 40 plumes are problematic, and with recombination, only 4 are. Then, the change in number of plumes could indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because if recombination increased the number of non-problematic plasmids, then the count would decrease. So, going from 40 to 4 suggests a significant increase in non-problematic plasmids, which would imply more recombination.\n\nCalculating the ratio: 40 vs 4. That's a factor of 10 reduction. So, recombination happened 10 times more frequently than no recombination.\n\nIf the maximum possible recombination frequency is 100%, and we observe a 1/10 reduction, that would correspond to 90% recombination (since 10% remaining). But none of the options reach 90%. The closest is option H (5%) or J (0.05%).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nThe number of plasmids detected in each sample is proportional to the number of cells. The first sample has 1:1e7 dilution, meaning 1e7 times more cells. The second sample has 1:1e5, meaning 1e5 times more cells.\n\nEach cell has a certain number of plasmids. Assuming that the number of plasmids per cell is constant, the total number of plasmids in each sample is proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nFor example, if each cell has N plasmids, then the first sample has N * 1e7 plasmids, and the second has N * 1e5 plasmids.\n\nWhen plated on strain B's lawn, any plasmids that are lysogenic will cause issues. If recombination occurs, some cells will have the leader mutation, allowing the lysogenic phage to work, whereas without recombination, all lysogenic phages would not work.\n\nAssuming that in the absence of recombination, all lysogenic phages (40 plasmids) cause issues, and with recombination, some lysogenic phages (say x plasmids) cause issues, leaving (40 - x) plasmids unaffected.\n\nBut according to the results, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. If recombination caused the number of plasmids that cause issues to reduce from 40 to 4, that's a 10x reduction. So, the number of plasmids that cause issues decreased by a factor of 10.\n\nThis suggests that recombination increased the number of non-problematic plasmids by a factor of 10, meaning that the recombination frequency is such that only 10% of the original plasmids cause issues now.\n\nBut recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of recombinant plasmids. So, if the original frequency was, say, 0% (no recombination), and now it's 10%, that would mean that 10% of the plasmids now cause issues.\n\nHowever, the way recombination frequency is typically calculated is as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes out of the total number of chromosomes. In this context, perhaps it's analogous to the percentage of recombinant plasmids.\n\nIf the number of recombinant plasmids is 1/10th of the total, that's 10%. But our options don't have 10%, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids in each sample. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nTotal plasmids in sample 1 (strain B): N_b = 40 * 1e7 (assuming 40 plasmids detected, each scaled up by 1e7)\nTotal plasmids in sample 2 (strain K): N_k = 4 * 1e5\n\nBut this seems off because the actual number of plasmids would be equal to the number detected multiplied by the dilution factor. Wait, actually, if you dilute 1:1e7, the number of cells becomes 1e7 times higher. Each cell has a certain number of plasmids, say P. So, the total number of plasmids in the sample is P * (1e7 + 1e5) \u2248 P * 1e7.\n\nBut since the exact number isn't known, maybe we can consider the relative numbers. If in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids are detected, and in strain K's sample, 4 plasmids are detected, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the number of plasmids in strain B's sample is 10 times that of strain K's.\n\nIf without recombination, all lysogenic phages would cause issues, so all plasmids would contribute. With recombination, some lysogenic phages would not cause issues anymore, thus reducing the number of plasmids contributing to the issue.\n\nSo, if in strain B's sample, the number of plasmids that cause issues is X, and in strain K's sample, it's Y, and we know that X/Y = 10 (because 40 plasmids in B correspond to X, and 4 plasmids in K correspond to Y, so X=10Y).\n\nIf recombination occurs, the number of plasmids that cause issues decreases by a factor of 10. So, X = Y / 10.\n\nSubstituting, Y / 10 = 10Y \u2192 No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I got it backwards.\n\nIf recombination reduces the number of problematic plasmids, then X = Y * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I'm getting tangled here. Perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected recombination frequency based on the number of plasmids.\n\nThe expected number of recombinant plasmids would be based on the number of cells. Each cell contributes to the total plasmid count. If there's recombination, then some cells will have the leader mutation, and others won't.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, all plasmids are non-recombinant, so no issues. With recombination, half the cells have the leader mutation, and half don't. Thus, half the plasmids would cause issues, leading to half the detected plasmids being problematic.\n\nIn the first sample (strain B), with recombination, half the plasmids would cause issues, so 40 / 2 = 20 plasmids. But the experiment shows 40 plasmids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Another thought: the presence of recombination allows the lysogenic phage to use the leader mutation, thus reducing the number of plasmids that cause issues. So, if recombination happens, the number of non-problematic plasmids increases.\n\nIn the first sample, strain B's population has higher dilution (1:1e7), so more cells. If recombination is common, then in this sample, even though there are more cells, the fraction of recombinant plasmids is lower because they're less likely to survive replication. Wait, that complicates things.\n\nMaybe instead of calculating directly, I should consider the ratio of plasmids. Since the first sample has 1e7 cells and the second has 1e5, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids that cause issues would scale accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nWithout recombination, all plasmids cause issues, so the number of plasmids causing issues is proportional to the number of cells.\n\nWith recombination, half the plasmids cause issues, so the number of plasmids causing issues is proportional to the number of cells divided by 2.\n\nThus, in the first sample, which has 1e7 cells, the number of plasmids causing issues would be (1e7 / 2) * (plasmids per cell). Similarly, in the second sample, (1e5 / 2) * plasmids per cell.\n\nGiven that in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids were detected, and in strain K's sample, 4 plasmids were detected, we can relate the plasmid counts.\n\nLet\u2019s call plasmids per cell as P.\n\nThen, for strain B: (1e7 / 2) * P = 40 \u21d2 P = (40 * 2) / 1e7 = 8e-6.\n\nFor strain K: (1e5 / 2) * P = 4 \u21d2 P = (4 * 2) / 1e5 = 8e-5.\n\nWait, that gives different values for P, which shouldn't happen. This inconsistency suggests my model is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids causing issues in each sample is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, higher dilution (lower number of plasmids) corresponds to fewer plasmids causing issues.\n\nGiven that, if recombination occurred, the number of plasmids causing issues would be proportional to the dilution factor. For example, higher dilution (lower number of plasmids) would have more plasmids causing issues.\n\nStrain B's sample has a higher dilution (1:1e7), so more cells \u2192 more plasmids \u2192 more chance for recombination. But if recombination happens, the number of plasmids causing issues would be higher in strain B's sample compared to strain K's.\n\nWait, in strain B's sample, 40 plasmids were detected, and in strain K's, 4. If recombination is occurring, the number of plasmids causing issues should be higher in strain B's sample because there are more cells, each with an increased chance of having the leader mutation. Conversely, in strain K's sample, which has fewer cells, fewer plasmids would cause issues.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plasmids causing issues between strain B and strain K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that 10 times more plasmids in strain B's sample are causing issues than in strain K's.\n\nIf recombination is responsible for this difference, then the recombination frequency can be inferred from the ratio of plasmids.\n\nAssuming that recombination frequency (F) affects the number of plasmids causing issues linearly, then F would be related to the ratio of plasmids. Specifically, if F is the frequency of recombination, then the number of plasmids causing issues would be proportional to (1 - F). Because recombination reduces the number of non-problematic plasmids.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship. Alternatively, since the number of plasmids causing issues is 10 times higher in strain B's sample, the recombination frequency might be approximately 90% because 1 - 0.9 = 0.1, which is a small loss. But that doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 10 times more plasmids cause issues in strain B's sample suggests that recombination occurred 90% of the time, but again, the options don't have 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the concept. Let me think differently. Suppose that recombination frequency (F) determines the proportion of cells that carry the recombination. If F is the frequency, then the number of cells with recombination is F * total cells.\n\nIn strain B's sample, which has 1e7 cells, if F is the recombination rate, then the number of cells with recombination is F * 1e7. Each of these cells carries the leader mutation, allowing the lysogenic phage to work, thus reducing the number of plasmids causing issues.\n\nIn strain K's sample, with 1e5 cells, the number of cells with recombination would be F * 1e5. The rest (1 - F) * 1e5 would not have the leader mutation, so the lysogenic phage cannot replicate effectively, leading to more plasmids causing issues.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids causing issues in strain B's sample would be proportional to (1e7 - F * 1e7) * P, and in strain K's sample, it would be proportional to (1e5 - F * 1e5) * P.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids causing issues between the two samples would then be [(1e7",

    "chunk_resampled": "Hmm, so let me think about what each dilution means.",
    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so let me think about what each dilution means. Dilution refers to how many bacteria you expose the phage to before diluting. Higher dilution means fewer bacteria per test tube, which increases the chance of random exposure leading to selection effects. In this case, if the phages have a certain level of mutation, the number of plumes detected would depend on whether these mutations allow the phages to replicate or lyse.\n\nThe key here is the difference in plume counts between the two dilutions. On the higher dilution (1:10^7), more bacteria are exposed, so lower-level replication or lysis events might be selected against. On the lower dilution (1:10^5), fewer bacteria mean higher chances of detecting more random events, including those caused by recombinant mutations.\n\nWait, so if the mutations are recombined, then perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B could now integrate the mutation from strain K, allowing it to cause more lysogenic fission despite being lysogenic itself? Or maybe the reverse. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage from strain K could have integrated a mutation from strain B, making it a different type of phage but still causing lysis in strain B.\n\nBut the main point is that when both types are present, the presence of recombination allows for more efficient selection of mutants that can either lyse or cause lysogenic fission in the target E. coli. So in the experiment, the higher dilution should show fewer plumes because more random events occur, whereas the lower dilution shows more because selection favors the mutants.\n\nGiven that we saw 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, this indicates that at the lower dilution, selection was stronger, favoring the mutants (since fewer plumes), while at higher dilution, less selection occurred, showing more random events. This suggests that the presence of recombination allows for better discrimination between the two types of phages, meaning that the mutations are likely to be recombined.\n\nNow, to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for calculating the efficiency of a recombination event is:\n\nEfficiency = (Number of observed recombined events - Number of expected non-recombined events) / Total observed events\n\nIn this case, without recombination, all events would follow the same distribution. If there's recombination, some events become combined.\n\nAssuming that the non-recombined events would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let's say the frequency of mutation A in strain B is p and in strain K is q. The probability of no recombination (both mutations are separate) is (1-p)(1-q). If recombination occurs, the probability becomes (1-p)(q) + (p)(1-q).\n\nFrom the results, at higher dilution, the number of plumes increased, indicating fewer recombined events. Wait, actually, higher dilution usually means more random events, so fewer plumes. Lower dilution has more plumes, indicating more selection for recombined mutants.\n\nSo, at higher dilution (1:10^7), we expect fewer plumes due to reduced selection, suggesting that most events are non-recombined. At lower dilution (1:10^5), we see more plumes, indicating more recombined events.\n\nLet's denote the total number of plumes as N. At higher dilution, N_high = 40, and at lower dilution, N_low = 4.\n\nIf there's complete non-recombination, then N_high would correspond to the sum of non-recombined events from both strains. Similarly, N_low would include some recombined events plus non-recombined ones.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the result was \"divided in half,\" implying equal parts, but further division into subcultures with different dilutions suggests that each subculture represents a different fraction of the original population.\n\nAt higher dilution (1:10^7), the total number of plumes detected is 40, which corresponds to the sum of non-recombined events from both strains. At lower dilution (1:10^5), the count is 4, which includes some recombined events plus the non-recombined ones.\n\nTo find the recombination rate, we can use the ratio of the plume counts between the two dilutions. The idea is that the ratio reflects the likelihood of recombination occurring during the selection process.\n\nSo, Recombination Rate = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9 \u2192 90% recombination. That seems high, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, because at higher dilution, the number of plumes is lower than expected under complete non-recombinational conditions. Actually, when there's recombination, the number of plumes should increase because some events are combined, thus reducing the overall number of unique events.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the relationship. Maybe the reciprocal applies. Let me think again.\n\nIn reality, when recombination occurs, some of the events become identical (i.e., the phages combine their mutations), thereby increasing the chance that certain combinations are selected against. Thus, the observed number of plumes would reflect both non-recombined and some recombined events.\n\nWait, but in our experiment, at higher dilution, the number of plumes is lower than expected, implying fewer non-recombined events. Wait, no, because higher dilution should have more random events, meaning fewer non-recombined events. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. The expected number of non-recombined events at higher dilution would be higher because less selection pressure. Since we're seeing fewer plumes, that suggests that the majority of events are recombined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is used differently. The number of plumes in the lower dilution is 4, which is much smaller than the 40 in the higher dilution. This implies that recombination occurred frequently enough to reduce the occurrence of unique events.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / N_high * 100%\n\n= (40 - 4)/40 * 100% = 36/40 * 100% = 90%.\n\nThat's a very high frequency, which doesn't match any of the options provided. The highest option given is F (0.3%). So clearly, I must have made an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula considers the inverse. Let me check online\u2014oh, right, this is a hypothetical scenario, so I need to proceed logically.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the efficiency of recombination. Suppose the probability of recombining is 'r'. Then, the number of plumes should reflect the combination of events.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that when recombination occurs, the number of plumes should decrease significantly compared to when they don't. However, in our case, the higher dilution has fewer plumes, which contradicts expectations unless recombination reduces the number of unique events.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes relates inversely to the number of events. So, if recombination happens often, the number of plumes decreases because some events are combined.\n\nLet me try using the equation where:\n\n(1 - r) = N_high / (N_high + N_low)\n\nWhich gives us the proportion of non-recombined events. Rearranging:\n\nr = 1 - (N_high / (N_high + N_low)) = 1 - (40/(40+4)) = 1 - (40/44) \u2248 1 - 0.909 \u2248 0.091 or 9.1%.\n\nThis is approximately 9%, but none of the options match this. The closest is H (5%) and G (0.5%).\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) * 100%\n\nWhich would give 90%, but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (N_low - N_high)/(N_low) *100%, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, let me look up a similar problem. In genetic studies, the coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as (number of double successes) / (number of single successes). In our case, perhaps it's analogous.\n\nBut maybe the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) * 100%.\n\nNo, that would be 90%, which isn't among the choices. Alternatively, perhaps it's (N_low - N_high) / (N_low) *100%, which would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So I must have applied the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that at higher dilution, the number of non-recombined events is higher, but in our case, the higher dilution has fewer plumes, implying fewer non-recombined events. Therefore, recombination must be frequent enough to reduce the number of unique events.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) *100% \u2192 90%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the logarithm of the probabilities.

So that approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the ratio of plume counts. Let\u2019s denote R as the ratio of plume counts between lower and higher dilution:\n\nR = 4 / 40 = 0.1\n\nThis suggests that the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 when moving from higher to lower dilution. If recombination occurred, the number of plumes would decrease according to some function of the recombination frequency.\n\nPerhaps the formula is:\n\nR = (1 - r) / (1 + r)\n\nWhere r is the recombination frequency. Solving for r:\n\nR = 0.1 = (1 - r)/(1 + r)\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n0.1*(1 + r) = 1 - r\n\n0.1 + 0.1r = 1 - r\n\n0.1r + r = 1 - 0.1\n\n1.1r = 0.9 \u2192 r = 0.9 / 1.1 \u2248 0.818 or 81.8%. Again, this is way higher than the options provided.\n\nClearly, I'm missing something here. Let's take a step back. The problem says that the resultally halved cells were plated on strain B's lawn, with half having 40 plumes, and the other half had 4 on strain K's lawn. Strain B is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, which is a recombination event, but when both types are present, the effect is more pronounced.\n\nThe initial assumption may be incorrect. Perhaps the presence of recombination leads to more efficient discrimination between the two types, hence the higher plume count in one group and lower in the other.\n\nIn such cases, the detection efficiency can be modeled by considering the overlap of the recombination events. The formula for the efficiency of detection when both mutations exist is:\n\nE = 1 - (1 - r)^2\n\nWhere r is the recombination frequency. Here, E would represent the efficiency of selecting for the mutated phages.\n\nBut since the question asks for the recombination frequency, perhaps it's easier to compute using the ratio of plume counts.\n\nAnother approach: The ratio of plume counts (higher dilution vs lower) can indicate the strength of the selection. The lower dilution shows more plumes, meaning more selection, which suggests that recombination occurred frequently enough to favor the mutants.\n\nIf we model the number of plumes as proportional to the number of independent events, then the ratio would relate to the square root of the recombination frequency, assuming independence. However, this is an approximation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nN_high = 40 (higher dilution)\nN_low = 4 (lower dilution)\n\nWe can assume that N_low = N_high * sqrt(1 - r) + ... but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of plumes depends on the number of independent selections, the ratio squared would approximate the recombination frequency. So:\n\n(N_low / N_high)^2 = 1 - r \u2192 r = 1 - (N_low/N_high)^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(4/40)^2 = (1/10)^2 = 1/100 \u2192 r = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 \u2192 99%. That's even higher than before, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nr = 1 - (N_low / N_high)^2 \u2192 same result.\n\nThis approach also doesn't align with the answer options. Given that the options go down to 0.05%, I suspect I've misapplied the principles.\n\nLet me think differently. The presence of recombination should lead to some reduction in the number of unique events. The ratio of pludes between the groups should reflect the extent of recombination.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, all events are unique, so the number of plumes would be proportional to the sum of both strains. With recombination, some events are shared, thus reducing the total number of unique plumes.\n\nThe formula relating the number of plumes (pl1 and pl2) to the recombination frequency (r) is:\n\npl1 = pl2 + (1 - r)*pl2 \u2192 pl1 = pl2*(2 - r)\n\nWait, not quite. Let me consider the plume counts as functions of recombination. Without recombination, the higher dilution would have more unique events than the lower dilution. With recombination, some events overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes in the lower dilution is a result of some combination of the two strains, scaled by the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\npl_higher = pl_lower + (1 - r)*pl_lower\n\nBut that would imply pl_higher = pl_lower*(1 + (1 - r)), which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pl_higher is the sum of pl_lower and the recombined events, multiplied by some factor. But I'm getting stuck.\n\nSince time is limited, I'll proceed with the information that the presence of recombination explains why the plume counts differ so much between the two dilutions. Given that the higher dilution has fewer plumes, indicating fewer unique events, and the lower dilution has more, suggesting more unique events, recombination must have occurred frequently enough to reduce the number of unique events.\n\nThe calculation I did earlier gave around 90% recombination frequency, but that's not an option. The closest option is G (0.5%), but that's way off. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the direction of the ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes in the lower dilution is 4, which is 1/10th of the higher dilution (40). So, if recombination happened 9 times, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor related to the square root of the recombination frequency. For example, if r = 0.01 (1%), then pl_low = pl_high * sqrt(1 - r) \u2248 pl_high * 0.995.\n\nBut pl_high is 40, pl_low is 4, so 4 \u2248 40 * 0.1, which would suggest r = 0.99, which again is over 90%, not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of plumes being the same as the ratio of the probabilities of no recombination. If recombination occurs, some events are independent, others are dependent.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of each event. So, if the probability of no recombination is p, then the expected number of plumes is proportional to p. If recombination occurs, the probability changes.\n\nBut without knowing the exact model, it's hard to apply. Given the time constraints, I'll have to choose the most plausible answer from the options.\n\nLooking back, the correct approach is to realize that the recombination frequency can be estimated from the difference in plume counts.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let me think about what each dilution means. Dilution refers to how many bacteria you expose the phage to before diluting. Higher dilution means fewer bacteria per test tube, which increases the chance of random exposure leading to selection effects. In this case, if the phages have a certain level of mutation, the number of plumes detected would depend on whether these mutations allow the phages to replicate or lyse.\n\nThe key here is the difference in plume counts between the two dilutions. On the higher dilution (1:10^7), more bacteria are exposed, so lower-level replication or lysis events might be selected against. On the lower dilution (1:10^5), fewer bacteria mean higher chances of detecting more random events, including those caused by recombinant mutations.\n\nWait, so if the mutations are recombined, then perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B could now integrate the mutation from strain K, allowing it to cause more lysogenic fission despite being lysogenic itself? Or maybe the reverse. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage from strain K could have integrated a mutation from strain B, making it a different type of phage but still causing lysis in strain B.\n\nBut the main point is that when both types are present, the presence of recombination allows for more efficient selection of mutants that can either lyse or cause lysogenic fission in the target E. coli. So in the experiment, the higher dilution should show fewer plumes because more random events occur, whereas the lower dilution shows more because selection favors the mutants.\n\nGiven that we saw 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, this indicates that at the lower dilution, selection was stronger, favoring the mutants (since fewer plumes), while at higher dilution, less selection occurred, showing more random events. This suggests that the presence of recombination allows for better discrimination between the two types of phages, meaning that the mutations are likely to be recombined.\n\nNow, to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for calculating the efficiency of a recombination event is:\n\nEfficiency = (Number of observed recombined events - Number of expected non-recombined events) / Total observed events\n\nIn this case, without recombination, all events would follow the same distribution. If there's recombination, some events become combined.\n\nAssuming that the non-recombined events would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let's say the frequency of mutation A in strain B is p and in strain K is q. The probability of no recombination (both mutations are separate) is (1-p)(1-q). If recombination occurs, the probability becomes (1-p)(q) + (p)(1-q).\n\nFrom the results, at higher dilution, the number of plumes increased, indicating fewer recombined events. Wait, actually, higher dilution usually means more random events, so fewer plumes. Lower dilution has more plumes, indicating more selection for recombined mutants.\n\nSo, at higher dilution (1:10^7), we expect fewer plumes due to reduced selection, suggesting that most events are non-recombined. At lower dilution (1:10^5), we see more plumes, indicating more recombined events.\n\nLet's denote the total number of plumes as N. At higher dilution, N_high = 40, and at lower dilution, N_low = 4.\n\nIf there's complete non-recombination, then N_high would correspond to the sum of non-recombined events from both strains. Similarly, N_low would include some recombined events plus non-recombined ones.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the result was \"divided in half,\" implying equal parts, but further division into subcultures with different dilutions suggests that each subculture represents a different fraction of the original population.\n\nAt higher dilution (1:10^7), the total number of plumes detected is 40, which corresponds to the sum of non-recombined events from both strains. At lower dilution (1:10^5), the count is 4, which includes some recombined events plus the non-recombined ones.\n\nTo find the recombination rate, we can use the ratio of the plume counts between the two dilutions. The idea is that the ratio reflects the likelihood of recombination occurring during the selection process.\n\nSo, Recombination Rate = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9 \u2192 90% recombination. That seems high, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, because at higher dilution, the number of plumes is lower than expected under complete non-recombinational conditions. Actually, when there's recombination, the number of plumes should increase because some events are combined, thus reducing the overall number of unique events.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the relationship. Maybe the reciprocal applies. Let me think again.\n\nIn reality, when recombination occurs, some of the events become identical (i.e., the phages combine their mutations), thereby increasing the chance that certain combinations are selected against. Thus, the observed number of plumes would reflect both non-recombined and some recombined events.\n\nWait, but in our experiment, at higher dilution, the number of plumes is lower than expected, implying fewer non-recombined events. Wait, no, because higher dilution should have more random events, meaning fewer non-recombined events. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach. The expected number of non-recombined events at higher dilution would be higher because less selection pressure. Since we're seeing fewer plumes, that suggests that the majority of events are recombined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is used differently. The number of plumes in the lower dilution is 4, which is much smaller than the 40 in the higher dilution. This implies that recombination occurred frequently enough to reduce the occurrence of unique events.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / N_high * 100%\n\n= (40 - 4)/40 * 100% = 36/40 * 100% = 90%.\n\nThat's a very high frequency, which doesn't match any of the options provided. The highest option given is F (0.3%). So clearly, I must have made an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula considers the inverse. Let me check online\u2014oh, right, this is a hypothetical scenario, so I need to proceed logically.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the efficiency of recombination. Suppose the probability of recombining is 'r'. Then, the number of plumes should reflect the combination of events.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that when recombination occurs, the number of plumes should decrease significantly compared to when they don't. However, in our case, the higher dilution has fewer plumes, which contradicts expectations unless recombination reduces the number of unique events.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes relates inversely to the number of events. So, if recombination happens often, the number of plumes decreases because some events are combined.\n\nLet me try using the equation where:\n\n(1 - r) = N_high / (N_high + N_low)\n\nWhich gives us the proportion of non-recombined events. Rearranging:\n\nr = 1 - (N_high / (N_high + N_low)) = 1 - (40/(40+4)) = 1 - (40/44) \u2248 1 - 0.909 \u2248 0.091 or 9.1%.\n\nThis is approximately 9%, but none of the options match this. The closest is H (5%) and G (0.5%).\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) * 100%\n\nWhich would give 90%, but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (N_low - N_high)/(N_low) *100%, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, let me look up a similar problem. In genetic studies, the coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as (number of double successes) / (number of single successes). In our case, perhaps it's analogous.\n\nBut maybe the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) * 100%.\n\nNo, that would be 90%, which isn't among the choices. Alternatively, perhaps it's (N_low - N_high) / (N_low) *100%, which would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So I must have applied the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that at higher dilution, the number of non-recombined events is higher, but in our case, the higher dilution has fewer plumes, implying fewer non-recombined events. Therefore, recombination must be frequent enough to reduce the number of unique events.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high) *100% \u2192 90%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the logarithm of the probabilities. The log of the probability of recombination is related to the reduction in the number of plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nlog(r) = (N_high - N_low) / (N_high + N_low) \u2192 which would be log(r) = (40-4)/(44) \u2248 0.819 \u2192 r \u2248 e^{0.819} \u2248 2.278, which is impossible since a recombination frequency cannot exceed 100%. So that approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the ratio of plume counts. Let\u2019s denote R as the ratio of plume counts between lower and higher dilution:\n\nR = 4 / 40 = 0.1\n\nThis suggests that the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 when moving from higher to lower dilution. If recombination occurred, the number of plumes would decrease according to some function of the recombination frequency.\n\nPerhaps the formula is:\n\nR = (1 - r) / (1 + r)\n\nWhere r is the recombination frequency. Solving for r:\n\nR = 0.1 = (1 - r)/(1 + r)\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n0.1*(1 + r) = 1 - r\n\n0.1 + 0.1r = 1 - r\n\n0.1r + r = 1 - 0.1\n\n1.1r = 0.9 \u2192 r = 0.9 / 1.1 \u2248 0.818 or 81.8%.

Recombination would mean that the mutations affect the same host DNA molecule, possibly interfering with each other's replication. If they are in a recombined form, they might have a lower chance of causing issues together compared to independent mutations. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the number of plumes on strain K is higher (40 vs. 4), indicating that the lysogenic phage (type 1) was less effective when co-infected with the lysogenic type (type 2). This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a dominant mutation or that it doesn't interfere much when present in combination. \n\nTo find the percentage recombination, I think we can use the formula: recombination frequency = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). However, I'm not entirely sure about this approach. Alternatively, since the effect on strain K is higher, it implies that the lysogenic phage has a dominant mutation, reducing its effectiveness when combined with another lysogenic phage. \n\nAnother way is to consider that the probability of an individual plume being caused by the recombination is inversely related to the dilution factor. Since one half was plated at 1:10^7 and the other at 1:10^5, the latter should be more affected by the recombination because it's less diluted. \n\nBut I'm still unsure about the exact calculation. Maybe I should think in terms of interference. If the mutations are in a recombined form, their presence reduces the likelihood of each other's activity. In such cases, the observed plumes would be fewer than expected from independent competition. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage (type 1) had a higher number of plumes when mixed with itself, it suggests that it's more likely to be recombined within the phage population. To estimate the percentage recombination, I might assume that the number of recombined plumes corresponds to a certain fraction of the total. \n\nIf the total number of plumes is 44 (4 + 40), then assuming that only a small fraction are recombinants, say x% of the total, then the number of recombines would be x/100 * 44. But without knowing the exact distribution, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering that when both phages are present, the number on strain K increased, implying that type 1 is more susceptible when present in combination with type 2. \n\nPerhaps using the ratio of plumes can help. The ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This ratio could indicate that the presence of the second lysogenic phage reduces the number of plumes on the first by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the recombination rate is low, the effect would be minimal. However, since the effect here is significant (plumes increase on K), the recombination must be high. To calculate the exact percentage, I might refer back to principles of genetic interference or use the formula for interference. \n\nWait, I remember that in some cases, the number of recombinant individuals decreases exponentially with the distance. For example, in interference experiments, the number of recombinant offspring is e^(-2n), where n is the distance. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the probability of recombination being proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Suppose p is the probability of each mutation. Then the probability of recombination would be 2p(1-p), assuming independence. \n\nIf the observed effect is that the number of plumes increases when recombination occurs, then the probability of recombination would influence how many plumes are seen. Without precise calculations, it's challenging to get the exact percentage. \n\nLooking at the options provided, the possible answers range from 0.02% up to 5%.

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution factors determine how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells are plated, so lower likelihood of random chance. The recombination fraction is typically calculated as the number of recombinant colonies divided by the total number of colonies. Here, 4 out of 40 on strain K would be 10%, but wait, that might not account for the dilution factors correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of times the two mutations recombine during replication. If the phages have different mutation rates, the combined effect can lead to some combination. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage does damage, any recombination must prevent the lysogenic from replicating. So if the mutations are linked, then only certain combinations will cause issues.\n\nThe key here is understanding how the recombination fraction relates to the observed plumes. The expected recombination fraction (f) can be estimated using the formula f = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of colonies + number of recombinant colonies). In this scenario, 4 recombinant colonies out of 44 total (4+36=40; wait, no, the other half has 40 on B and 4 on K, making 44 in total?), so maybe f = 4/44 \u2248 9%. But the options don't include 9%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the dilution factors more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombination events affects the efficiency of each phage. Since only the lysogenic phage causes problems, any mutations that prevent its replication would reduce the yield. The dilution factors indicate how much each group was plated. For example, 1:10^7 implies 0.01% cells (since 1e-7 is 0.000001), and 1:10^5 is 0.001%. The presence of enough cells plated could increase the likelihood of seeing multiple mutations leading to recombination.\n\nBut wait, the recombination fraction is usually about 10% or less, and sometimes up to 50%. However, looking at the options, the highest is 5%, which is option G. But my initial calculation gave around 9%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids: 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5. If the phages are homologous, their mutations might interfere. The expected recombination frequency (f) can be determined by the ratio of the plasmid concentrations. Wait, the formula for the probability of recombination is f = (p/q), where p and q are the frequencies of the mutated alleles. But without knowing the exact allele frequencies, this might not help directly.\n\nAnother angle: the observed number of recombinant colonies (4 on K) compared to non-recombinant (36 on K) and (40 on B). Total is 44. So 4/(4+36)=4/40=10%, which isn't an option either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Maybe the plasmids are not at high concentrations, affecting the recombination rate differently.\n\nWait, let me think again. The presence of the two types of phages might lead to interference in replication. If the lysogenic phage is active, it might inhibit the replication of the T_4 phage, which is why only it causes issues. So the recombination occurs within the T_4 phage itself. The recombination fraction depends on how often the two mutations occur in the same phage copy.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is small, say 2%, that would mean only 2% of the phages show both mutations. Looking back at the plume counts, 4 on K and 40 on B. Total is 44. If f=0.02 (option I), then the expected recombinant colonies would be f * total = 0.02*44\u22480.88. But we see 4, which is significantly higher. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the recombination frequency. If f is 0.02, then expected recombinants would be 0.02*(total). But our observed is 4, which is way higher than expected if f is low. Maybe I inverted something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation uses the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies / (total colonies + number of recombinant colonies) = f\n\nSo 4/(44)\u22480.0909, which is approximately 9.09%. But none of the options match this. The closest is option H (5%) or F (0.3%). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me recall: the recombination frequency (f) is equal to the probability that a randomly selected chromosome contains both mutated alleles. It can be calculated as:\n\nf = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total individuals - number of recombinant individuals)\n\nIn this case, 4/(44-4)=4/40=10%.\n\nStill not matching the options. Maybe the correct answer is B (2%), implying a lower f.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factors. If the lysogenic phage is less likely to replicate due to recombination, the effective concentration increases. Let me try that.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is replicative only when there's no recombination, then the effective concentration of lysogenic phages increases, reducing their impact. This could lead to more successful infections when the lysogenic phage is rare.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the effective concentration of lysogenic phages would depend on r. If r is 0.02, then the lysogenic phage becomes more prevalent, increasing its ability to infect E. coli.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The observed recombinant colonies are 4 out of 44. So f \u2248 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. None of the options match this exactly, but the closest is option H (5%) and option F (0.3%). However, 9.09% isn't close to either. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: the recombination frequency might relate to the ratio of the plasmid concentrations. If the lysogenic phage is less active due to recombination, its concentration increases. The ratio of lysogenic to T4 phages might affect the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, the plating density plays a role. Dilution factors affect the plating efficiency. For example, 1:10^7 dilutes the phage to 0.01% cells, while 1:10^5 is 0.1%. If the phages are more numerous in the lysogenic type, their plating efficiency is better, leading to more successful infections.\n\nBut I'm still not connecting this to the recombination frequency. Maybe I need to think about the plating efficiency and how it affects the outcome. If the lysogenic phages are more common, they might dominate the infection, leading to more successful lysogenic infections and fewer recombinant ones.\n\nWait, the problem states that the two mutants are causing lytic and lysogenic fission respectively. Only lysogenic is bad. So any recombination prevents lysogenic replication, thus causing lethality. The presence of two different mutations complicates this. The fact that E. coli B shows almost all the issue indicates that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent in those strains, suggesting that the phage is more likely to cause lysogeny.\n\nSo, the recombination frequency would be such that the lysogenic phage is less active when recombined. The observed plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness is reduced. Thus, the recombination frequency might be lower than expected if the phage were fully functional.\n\nLooking at the options, the lowest is E (0.05%) and D (0.1%). My earlier estimate was ~9%, which is way too high. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E (0.05%) or D (0.1%). But 9% isn't near either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of the two plating concentrations. If the lysogenic phage is being replicated more efficiently when there's no recombination, then the recombination frequency would influence the overall success. The ratio of plating concentrations (1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5) is 100:1. If the lysogenic phage is more active without recombination, the overall success might be better, leading to fewer recombinant colonies.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this translates into the recombination frequency. Maybe the recombination frequency determines how often the lysogenic phage successfully replicates. If the frequency is low, the lysogenic phage is more prone to failure, leading to fewer recombinant colonies.\n\nGiven that, and seeing 4 out of 44 recombinants, which is about 9%, which isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, which is the frequency 'f'. So according to the formula f = (number of recombinant) / (total), which is 4/44\u22480.0909\u22489.09%. But since this isn't an option, maybe I should consider the reciprocal or another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the total is 44. If f is 0.02, then 0.02*44\u22480.88, which rounds to 1. That's not 4. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if f is 0.05 (option E), then 0.05*44\u22482.2, which rounds to 2. Close but not 4. Option C is 1.5%, giving 0.66, which is closer to 1 but not 4. Option G is 5%, which gives 2.2, also closer to 2. Option F is 0.3%, giving 1.32, which is closer to 1. Option J is 0.05%, giving 0.22, which is closer to 0. But none give 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the rest are non-recombinant. So total is 44, with 4 being recombinant. The fraction is 4/44=0.0909\u22489.09%. Since 9% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is the closest, which would be E (0.05%) or D (0.1%). But neither is 9%. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of the two plating concentrations. The lysogenic phage is more efficient when there's no recombination, meaning higher recombination frequency leads to less activity. The ratio is 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5, which simplifies to 100:1. If the recombination frequency is r, then the lysogenic phage's activity is reduced by (1 - r)/ (1 + r). But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of recombinant colonies is 4, total is 44. So the proportion is 4/44=0.0909. If the possible answers are fractions like 0.01, 0.02, etc., but none match 0.09. So perhaps the intended answer is the closest lower option, which would be E (0.05%) or D (0.1%). But 0.09 is closer to 0.1% than to 0.05%. However, 0.09 isn't an option. Maybe the intended answer is 0.1%, option D, despite being a bit higher than 0.09.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B (2%) because the observed ratio suggests that the recombination frequency is around 2%. Let me check: if f=0.02, then 0.02*44=0.88\u22481. Which is closer to 1 than to 4. If f=0.05, then 0.05*44=2.2\u22482, which is closer to 2. So depending on rounding, 0.05 gives 2, which is closer to the observed 4. Hmm, but 2 is farther from 4 than 1 is from 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the total is 44. The expected recombinant colonies under complete recombination would be zero, but that's not the case. Under partial recombination, you get some. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is 2%, option B, even though the calculation suggests around 9%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dilution factors. Perhaps they're applied differently. Let me recalculate:\n\nDilution factor 1: 1:10^7 \u2192 0.01%\nDilution factor 2: 1:10^5 \u2192 0.001%\n\nNow, if the phages are homologous, their mutations may interfere. The presence of the two types means that some recombination happens, but the efficiency reduces. The recombination fraction is influenced by the ratio of plating densities. The formula for the expected recombination frequency when two mutations are present is f = (d2/d1)^n, where d1 and d2 are the dilution factors and n is the number of generations. But I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the probability of recombination in a population with two mutation types is f = (p/q), where p and q are the allele frequencies. But without knowing p and q, this isn't helpful.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of expected recombinant colonies. If the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of recombinant colonies is r * total. Given that, and observing 4 out of 44, solving for r gives r \u2248 4/44 \u22480.0909. Still not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the observed number of recombinant colonies corresponds to the product of the recombination frequency and the total number of plasmids.

Because 0.1*44=4.4, which rounds to 4. So that would imply a recombination frequency of 0.1%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory because 0.1% would make the expected recombinant colonies 4.4, which is closer to 4 than 2 or 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution factors determine how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells are plated, so lower likelihood of random chance. The recombination fraction is typically calculated as the number of recombinant colonies divided by the total number of colonies. Here, 4 out of 40 on strain K would be 10%, but wait, that might not account for the dilution factors correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of times the two mutations recombine during replication. If the phages have different mutation rates, the combined effect can lead to some combination. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage does damage, any recombination must prevent the lysogenic from replicating. So if the mutations are linked, then only certain combinations will cause issues.\n\nThe key here is understanding how the recombination fraction relates to the observed plumes. The expected recombination fraction (f) can be estimated using the formula f = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of colonies + number of recombinant colonies). In this scenario, 4 recombinant colonies out of 44 total (4+36=40; wait, no, the other half has 40 on B and 4 on K, making 44 in total?), so maybe f = 4/44 \u2248 9%. But the options don't include 9%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the dilution factors more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombination events affects the efficiency of each phage. Since only the lysogenic phage causes problems, any mutations that prevent its replication would reduce the yield. The dilution factors indicate how much each group was plated. For example, 1:10^7 implies 0.01% cells (since 1e-7 is 0.000001), and 1:10^5 is 0.001%. The presence of enough cells plated could increase the likelihood of seeing multiple mutations leading to recombination.\n\nBut wait, the recombination fraction is usually about 10% or less, and sometimes up to 50%. However, looking at the options, the highest is 5%, which is option G. But my initial calculation gave around 9%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plasmids: 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5. If the phages are homologous, their mutations might interfere. The expected recombination frequency (f) can be determined by the ratio of the plasmid concentrations. Wait, the formula for the probability of recombination is f = (p/q), where p and q are the frequencies of the mutated alleles. But without knowing the exact allele frequencies, this might not help directly.\n\nAnother angle: the observed number of recombinant colonies (4 on K) compared to non-recombinant (36 on K) and (40 on B). Total is 44. So 4/(4+36)=4/40=10%, which isn't an option either. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Maybe the plasmids are not at high concentrations, affecting the recombination rate differently.\n\nWait, let me think again. The presence of the two types of phages might lead to interference in replication. If the lysogenic phage is active, it might inhibit the replication of the T_4 phage, which is why only it causes issues. So the recombination occurs within the T_4 phage itself. The recombination fraction depends on how often the two mutations occur in the same phage copy.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is small, say 2%, that would mean only 2% of the phages show both mutations. Looking back at the plume counts, 4 on K and 40 on B. Total is 44. If f=0.02 (option I), then the expected recombinant colonies would be f * total = 0.02*44\u22480.88. But we see 4, which is significantly higher. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the recombination frequency. If f is 0.02, then expected recombinants would be 0.02*(total). But our observed is 4, which is way higher than expected if f is low. Maybe I inverted something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation uses the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies / (total colonies + number of recombinant colonies) = f\n\nSo 4/(44)\u22480.0909, which is approximately 9.09%. But none of the options match this. The closest is option H (5%) or F (0.3%). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me recall: the recombination frequency (f) is equal to the probability that a randomly selected chromosome contains both mutated alleles. It can be calculated as:\n\nf = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total individuals - number of recombinant individuals)\n\nIn this case, 4/(44-4)=4/40=10%.\n\nStill not matching the options. Maybe the correct answer is B (2%), implying a lower f.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factors. If the lysogenic phage is less likely to replicate due to recombination, the effective concentration increases. Let me try that.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is replicative only when there's no recombination, then the effective concentration of lysogenic phages increases, reducing their impact. This could lead to more successful infections when the lysogenic phage is rare.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the effective concentration of lysogenic phages would depend on r. If r is 0.02, then the lysogenic phage becomes more prevalent, increasing its ability to infect E. coli.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The observed recombinant colonies are 4 out of 44. So f \u2248 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. None of the options match this exactly, but the closest is option H (5%) and option F (0.3%). However, 9.09% isn't close to either. Perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: the recombination frequency might relate to the ratio of the plasmid concentrations. If the lysogenic phage is less active due to recombination, its concentration increases. The ratio of lysogenic to T4 phages might affect the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, the plating density plays a role. Dilution factors affect the plating efficiency. For example, 1:10^7 dilutes the phage to 0.01% cells, while 1:10^5 is 0.1%. If the phages are more numerous in the lysogenic type, their plating efficiency is better, leading to more successful infections.\n\nBut I'm still not connecting this to the recombination frequency. Maybe I need to think about the plating efficiency and how it affects the outcome. If the lysogenic phages are more common, they might dominate the infection, leading to more successful lysogenic infections and fewer recombinant ones.\n\nWait, the problem states that the two mutants are causing lytic and lysogenic fission respectively. Only lysogenic is bad. So any recombination prevents lysogenic replication, thus causing lethality. The presence of two different mutations complicates this. The fact that E. coli B shows almost all the issue indicates that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent in those strains, suggesting that the phage is more likely to cause lysogeny.\n\nSo, the recombination frequency would be such that the lysogenic phage is less active when recombined. The observed plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness is reduced. Thus, the recombination frequency might be lower than expected if the phage were fully functional.\n\nLooking at the options, the lowest is E (0.05%) and D (0.1%). My earlier estimate was ~9%, which is way too high. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E (0.05%) or D (0.1%). But 9% isn't near either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of the two plating concentrations. If the lysogenic phage is being replicated more efficiently when there's no recombination, then the recombination frequency would influence the overall success. The ratio of plating concentrations (1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5) is 100:1. If the lysogenic phage is more active without recombination, the overall success might be better, leading to fewer recombinant colonies.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this translates into the recombination frequency. Maybe the recombination frequency determines how often the lysogenic phage successfully replicates. If the frequency is low, the lysogenic phage is more prone to failure, leading to fewer recombinant colonies.\n\nGiven that, and seeing 4 out of 44 recombinants, which is about 9%, which isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, which is the frequency 'f'. So according to the formula f = (number of recombinant) / (total), which is 4/44\u22480.0909\u22489.09%. But since this isn't an option, maybe I should consider the reciprocal or another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the total is 44. If f is 0.02, then 0.02*44\u22480.88, which rounds to 1. That's not 4. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if f is 0.05 (option E), then 0.05*44\u22482.2, which rounds to 2. Close but not 4. Option C is 1.5%, giving 0.66, which is closer to 1 but not 4. Option G is 5%, which gives 2.2, also closer to 2. Option F is 0.3%, giving 1.32, which is closer to 1.

So total is 44, with 4 being recombinant. The fraction is 4/44=0.0909\u22489.09%. Since 9% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is the closest, which would be E (0.05%) or D (0.1%).

But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of recombinant colonies is 4, total is 44. So the proportion is 4/44=0.0909.

So the first group was more diluted (1:10^7), meaning fewer bacteria to affect, while the second was less diluted (1:10^5), allowing more chance for mutation. \n\nThe key here is that when the two mutants interact, their effects combine. If both mutations are present, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations increases. Since the first group was more diluted, any mutation would have a higher chance of being present. In the second group, since it's less diluted, the presence of both mutations is even more likely. \n\nIn the experiment, only a quarter of the plasmid (since 1:10^5 is 1/100 of the original, but wait, no\u2014dilution factor 1:10^n means n orders of magnitude decrease in concentration. So 1:10^7 would mean each sample has 1/10 million cells, and 1:10^5 is 1/100,000. \n\nIf the mutations occurred in both, the number of plasmids carrying both would depend on the frequency of each mutation. Let's say the frequency of lysogenic phage is p and the frequency of the other mutation is q. Then the expected number of plasmids with both mutations would be pq times the total population. \n\nFrom the results, on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 were found. Wait, no\u2014the first half was plated on strain B's lawn, and the second on K's. So the 40 plumes correspond to strain B, and 4 to strain K. \n\nAssuming that the strain B is more susceptible because only the lysogenic phage affects it, but in reality, the presence of both mutations could make strain B more susceptible as well. However, the main point is about recombination. \n\nSo, if the mutations are linked and recombine, the recombinant phages would form new plasmids. The likelihood of having both mutations depends on the crossover rate during replication. However, without knowing the exact numbers, we can infer based on the number of plumes observed. \n\nWhen both mutations are present, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is pq. The number of plasmids with both should be proportional to pq. Since the first group had 40 plumes and the second had 4, the ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the chance of having both mutations is tenfold higher in the second group than the first. \n\nBut wait, the first group was more diluted, meaning that the chance of a bacterium carrying both mutations is higher. So the actual count of plasmids with both mutations would be higher in the first group. \n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes, if there were X plasmids with both mutations in the first group, then in the second group, it would be X * (1:10^2), because the dilution factor is 100 times less. So if in the first group, there were X plasmids, in the second, it would be X / 100. \n\nGiven that the first group had 40 plumes and the second had 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the number of plasmids with both mutations was 40 in the first group, leading to 0.4 plasmids in the second group. \n\nBut wait, this approach might not directly give us the recombination frequency. Instead, perhaps we can use the concept that the number of plasmids with both mutations is equal to the product of their frequencies. So if the number of plasmids with both is N, then N = p * q. \n\nSince the first group had N plasmids and the second had N / 100, and the ratio of plumes is 40 to 4, which simplifies to 10:1, this implies that N / (N / 100) = 10, meaning that the recombination event increased the number of plasmids with both mutations by a factor of 10. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency (rf) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nrf = -ln(pq)\n\nBut since we're dealing with ratios, we can approximate rf \u2248 ln(N2/N1), where N1 and N2 are the counts in the two groups. Here, N2 = N1 * 10, so ln(10) \u2248 2.3026. However, this gives us a value much larger than the options provided. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. The number of plasmids with both mutations is proportional to the product of their frequencies. Let\u2019s denote the frequency of the first mutation as p and the second as q. Then the expected number of plasmids with both is p*q*N_total, where N_total is the total number of plasmids. \n\nIn the first group, which is more diluted, the number of plasmids with both mutations would be higher. The ratio between the two groups is 10:1, indicating that the product p*q is 10 times higher in the first group than in the second. \n\nHowever, without knowing the absolute values, it's challenging. Alternatively, the number of plumes can indicate the proportion. If the first group had 40 plumes and the second 4, the ratio is 10:1, meaning that the probability of having both mutations is ten times higher in the first group compared to the second. \n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the expected count in the first group is 10 times that in the second group. If we assume that the expected count in the second group is zero due to low dilution, but that's not necessarily true because even with low dilution, some mutations may exist. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plasmids with both mutations is N = p*q*N_total. In the first group, N1 = p*q*N_total, and in the second group, N2 = p*q*(N_total / 100). Given that N1/N2 = 10, which implies that N1 = 10*N2. Therefore, p*q remains the same across groups, but N_total must adjust accordingly. \n\nWait, this isn\u2019t helping. Maybe I should look at it differently. The number of plasmids with both mutations is proportional to the product of their frequencies. If the first group (more diluted) shows a higher count of both mutations, then the recombination frequency must be high enough to increase the probability of both mutations occurring together. \n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Since the ratio is 10:1, which corresponds to a log ratio of approximately 2.3, this suggests a higher recombination frequency. \n\nUsing the approximation that recombination frequency (rf) \u2248 ln(ratio) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3, which converts to a percentage as 2.3%.

If both mutations are present, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations increases. Since the first group was more diluted, any mutation would have a higher chance of being present. In the second group, since it's less diluted, the presence of both mutations is even more likely. \n\nIn the experiment, only a quarter of the plasmid (since 1:10^5 is 1/100 of the original, but wait, no\u2014dilution factor 1:10^n means n orders of magnitude decrease in concentration. So 1:10^7 would mean each sample has 1/10 million cells, and 1:10^5 is 1/100,000. \n\nIf the mutations occurred in both, the number of plasmids carrying both would depend on the frequency of each mutation. Let's say the frequency of lysogenic phage is p and the frequency of the other mutation is q. Then the expected number of plasmids with both mutations would be pq times the total population. \n\nFrom the results, on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 were found. Wait, no\u2014the first half was plated on strain B's lawn, and the second on K's. So the 40 plumes correspond to strain B, and 4 to strain K. \n\nAssuming that the strain B is more susceptible because only the lysogenic phage affects it, but in reality, the presence of both mutations could make strain B more susceptible as well. However, the main point is about recombination. \n\nSo, if the mutations are linked and recombine, the recombinant phages would form new plasmids. The likelihood of having both mutations depends on the crossover rate during replication. However, without knowing the exact numbers, we can infer based on the number of plumes observed. \n\nWhen both mutations are present, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations is pq. The number of plasmids with both should be proportional to pq. Since the first group had 40 plumes and the second had 4, the ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the chance of having both mutations is tenfold higher in the second group than the first. \n\nBut wait, the first group was more diluted, meaning that the chance of a bacterium carrying both mutations is higher. So the actual count of plasmids with both mutations would be higher in the first group. \n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes, if there were X plasmids with both mutations in the first group, then in the second group, it would be X * (1:10^2), because the dilution factor is 100 times less. So if in the first group, there were X plasmids, in the second, it would be X / 100. \n\nGiven that the first group had 40 plumes and the second had 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the number of plasmids with both mutations was 40 in the first group, leading to 0.4 plasmids in the second group. \n\nBut wait, this approach might not directly give us the recombination frequency. Instead, perhaps we can use the concept that the number of plasmids with both mutations is equal to the product of their frequencies. So if the number of plasmids with both is N, then N = p * q. \n\nSince the first group had N plasmids and the second had N / 100, and the ratio of plumes is 40 to 4, which simplifies to 10:1, this implies that N / (N / 100) = 10, meaning that the recombination event increased the number of plasmids with both mutations by a factor of 10. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency (rf) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nrf = -ln(pq)\n\nBut since we're dealing with ratios, we can approximate rf \u2248 ln(N2/N1), where N1 and N2 are the counts in the two groups. Here, N2 = N1 * 10, so ln(10) \u2248 2.3026. However, this gives us a value much larger than the options provided. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. The number of plasmids with both mutations is proportional to the product of their frequencies. Let\u2019s denote the frequency of the first mutation as p and the second as q. Then the expected number of plasmids with both is p*q*N_total, where N_total is the total number of plasmids. \n\nIn the first group, which is more diluted, the number of plasmids with both mutations would be higher. The ratio between the two groups is 10:1, indicating that the product p*q is 10 times higher in the first group than in the second. \n\nHowever, without knowing the absolute values, it's challenging. Alternatively, the number of plumes can indicate the proportion. If the first group had 40 plumes and the second 4, the ratio is 10:1, meaning that the probability of having both mutations is ten times higher in the first group compared to the second. \n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the expected count in the first group is 10 times that in the second group. If we assume that the expected count in the second group is zero due to low dilution, but that's not necessarily true because even with low dilution, some mutations may exist. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plasmids with both mutations is N = p*q*N_total. In the first group, N1 = p*q*N_total, and in the second group, N2 = p*q*(N_total / 100). Given that N1/N2 = 10, which implies that N1 = 10*N2. Therefore, p*q remains the same across groups, but N_total must adjust accordingly. \n\nWait, this isn\u2019t helping. Maybe I should look at it differently. The number of plasmids with both mutations is proportional to the product of their frequencies. If the first group (more diluted) shows a higher count of both mutations, then the recombination frequency must be high enough to increase the probability of both mutations occurring together. \n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Since the ratio is 10:1, which corresponds to a log ratio of approximately 2.3, this suggests a higher recombination frequency. \n\nUsing the approximation that recombination frequency (rf) \u2248 ln(ratio) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3, which converts to a percentage as 2.3%. Looking at the options, B is 2%, which fits. \n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, how do these dilutions work?",
    "rollout": " \n\nWait, how do these dilutions work? Dilution affects the probability of the mutation being passed on. If you have a higher dilution, each phage has a lower chance of causing a lytic or lysogenic effect. So if one half is more dilute than the other, any mutations would be less likely to be expressed in that group. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage might be more effective at replicating, leading to more plasmid loss. But since it doesn't cause lytic fission, it might interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. Alternatively, maybe the two phages are crossing over, creating recombinant mutants that have both effects, making them more potent. \n\nThe key here is determining how often the mutations interact. The number of plasmids lost depends on whether the mutations are in the same or different regions. If they're recombined, the new phage will have both mutations, possibly leading to increased fitness. The observed difference in plume counts could indicate the likelihood of such interactions. \n\nLooking at the data, the strain B has 40 plumes, while strain K has 4. That seems like a significant difference, suggesting that the combination was more likely to occur where the mutations didn't interfere. Maybe the recombination rate is low enough that most cases don't produce a double mutant. \n\nRecombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of times two genes are exchanged during meiosis. In this scenario, if the mutations are recombined, it would lead to increased selection against the phage. However, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, the presence of the lysogenic phage might still dominate, especially in the B strain. \n\nAnother angle is considering the dilution factors. Plating on strain B's lawn with a higher dilution (1:10^7) means fewer phages, so the chance of cross-reacting with the lysogenic phage is lower. Strain K's lawn is less dilute, so more phages, potentially increasing the chances of recombination. \n\nGiven the high number of plumes on B (40) compared to K (4), it's possible that recombination occurred in a fraction of the cases. If the RF is low, say 0.02%, then only a small percentage of phages would exhibit recombination. This would explain why more plumes appeared in B than in K. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination. I think it refers to the percentage of time that the two mutations crossed over. If the RF is 0.02%, that's very low. However, sometimes experiments report this as the percentage of crossover events per gamete. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for expected plumes: if two mutations are present in a double mutant, the number of plasmid loss plumes is proportional to the product of their frequencies. But in this case, strain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. If the total number of plumes from both is 44, and assuming each mutation contributes independently, perhaps the RF is calculated based on the ratio of plumes. \n\nIf we consider the total number of plumes from both groups: 40 + 4 = 44. The number from K is 4, which is roughly 9% of the total. If this represents the proportion of cases where recombination occurred, then the RF would be approximately 9%. But that seems too high, especially given the options provided.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The recombination frequency can also be determined using the formula involving the number of plumes. The formula for calculating RF is:\n\nRF = (number of recombining plumes / total number of plumes) * 100%\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Alternatively, if the number of plumes on strain B is much higher than on strain K, it might suggest that the recombination happened frequently enough to affect the outcome. \n\nAnother approach is to calculate the log odds of recombination. The number of plumes can help estimate this. The formula is:\n\nlog10(RF) = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhere n_B is the number of plumes on strain B, and n_K is on strain K. Plugging in the numbers:\n\nn_B = 40, n_K = 4\n\nlog10(RF) = (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818\n\nSo RF \u2248 10^0.818 \u2248 6.6. That can't be right because RF should be between 0 and 100%.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake. Maybe the formula is different. Perhaps it's:\n\nlog10(RF) = (n_B - n_K)/n_total\n\nWhich would give:\n\n(40 - 4)/44 \u2248 0.818 \u2192 RF \u2248 6.6%\n\nThat's even worse. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps another way is to use the fact that the number of plumes indicates the probability of recombination. If strain B has 40 and strain K has 4, the difference is 36, which is 36/44 \u2248 0.818, meaning that about 82% of the cases involved recombination. But again, that doesn't make sense because RF is usually between 0-100, not percentages of cases.\n\nMaybe the correct formula is RF = (n_B - n_K)/n_total * 100\n\nWhich gives (36/44)*100 \u2248 81.8%, which is impossible because RF cannot exceed 100%. So clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me think differently. The presence of the lysogenic phage in E. coli strain B leads to plasmid loss because it doesn't lyse the cell. When both phages are present, some of the lysogenic phage may lose its lysogenic function due to recombination, allowing it to replicate without lytic fission. This would reduce the number of plasmid loss events, explaining why strain B had more plumes (more loss) and strain K had fewer (less loss).\n\nThe recombination frequency would determine how often the lysogenic phage's lysogenic function is lost. If recombination happens frequently, the lysogenic phage would replicate better, leading to more plasmid loss and more plumes. Conversely, low recombination would mean fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the difference is a factor of 10. This suggests that the recombination happened many times. However, looking back at the options, the highest is 5%, which is quite low. But according to the calculation earlier, RF is around 81.8%, which is way higher than any option provided except F (0.3%) and G (0.5%).\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my initial assumption about the formula might be incorrect. Perhaps I should use the formula for the probability of recombination:\n\np = (n_B + n_K) / (n_B * n_K)\n\nBut with n_B=40, n_K=4,\n\np = (40+4)/(40*4)=44/160=0.275 or 27.5%, which is still too high.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the probability of recombination occurring at least once in multiple trials is:\n\n1 - e^{-p}\n\nBut without knowing the number of trials, it's hard to apply.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plumes indicates the number of independent instances where recombination occurred. If there are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination happened 4 times more often on B than on K. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the difference in plumes reflects the difference in the recombination rates. If strain B shows 40 plumes and K shows 4, the recombination must have occurred significantly more often in B. Given the options, the closest is H (5%), but 5% seems low. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a scaling factor.\n\nWait, let me try calculating the log odds ratio. The number of plumes can be used to compute the log odds of recombination. The formula is:\n\nlog10(odds) = log10(n_B / n_K)\n\nWhich is log10(40/4) = log10(10) = 1 \u2192 Odds = 10^1 = 10 \u2192 RF = 10/(10+1) \u2248 9%. Again, 9% is way beyond any provided option, which makes me think I'm still misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nPerhaps instead of plumes, I should think about the relative numbers indicating the likelihood of recombination. For example, the number of plumes on B is 10 times higher than on K, which might imply a high recombination rate. But again, none of the options match 100%, so I must be off track.\n\nLet me think about what the question is asking directly: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" It wants the percentage of time that the mutations were recombined. From the experimental results, if the recombination is frequent, the number of plumes would reflect that. Since strain B has many more plumes, it suggests that recombination is happening frequently. However, the answer options don't include anything close to 100%. Therefore, perhaps the intended method is to calculate the logarithm of the ratio.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nlog10(FR) = (n_B - n_K)/(n_B + n_K)\n\nAs before, this gives (40-4)/(40+4)=36/44\u22480.818\u2192 FR\u22486.6%, which is still too low. Wait, no\u2014actually, I think I misapplied the formula. The correct formula for RF is:\n\nFR = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did, giving 6.6%. Still, that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nFR = (n_B + n_K) / |n_B - n_K|\n\nBut that would be 44 / 36 \u2248 1.22, which is also not an option.\n\nHmm. Another approach is to look at the ratio of plumes on B to K: 40 vs 4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that recombination occurred 10 times more often on B than on K. If recombination occurs 10 times more often on B, and the total RF is 100%, then the frequency would be 100%. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\np = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich gives us 0.818, as before, meaning that about 81.8% of the time, recombination occurred. But that's more than all the options provide, so perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nThe options are percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%. These seem extremely low, which contradicts the experimental observation where strain B has more plumes. Unless the recombination frequency is actually 5%, but that seems counterintuitive because the lysogenic phage shouldn't be affected much by recombination unless it introduces new mutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the population where recombination occurred, rather than the overall RF. If 40 out of 44 cases involve recombination, that's about 90.9%, which is still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to take the difference in plumes and relate it to the recombination frequency using a specific equation. For instance, the number of plumes could be related to the recombination frequency through:\n\nplumes = (recombination frequency) \u00d7 (total number of phages)\n\nBut I'm not certain about this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes could represent the number of successful recombination events. If the recombination happens 40 times, and the total number of phages is 44, then the recombination frequency would be 40/44\u224890.9%, which again doesn't fit the options.\n\nAt this point, I'm realizing that perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the difference in plumes and interpret it as a measure of recombination. The difference is 36, and the total is 44, so 36/44\u22480.818, implying that recombination occurred 81.8% of the time. But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 0.02%, which is option I. But that seems too low because the difference is large.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / n_B\n\nWhich would be (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9 \u2192 90%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, (n_B - n_K) / n_K = 36/4 = 9, which is 900%, which is not useful.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should reconsider the experimental design. Both strains are treated separately: one is plated on B, the other on K. The result is that B has more plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic phage on B is more likely to recombine. However, according to the options, the lowest is 0.02%, which seems too low given the significant difference in plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the difference in plumes relates to the number of times the recombination event occurred. Each time the lysogenic phage loses its lysogenic function, it can replicate without lytic fission. If this happens frequently, the lysogenic phage can replicate better, leading to more plasmid loss. Thus, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of times recombination occurred.\n\nTherefore, if strain B has 40 plumes and K has 4, the recombination must have occurred 40 times more often on B than on K. But how does that translate into a percentage?\n\nIf the total number of plumes is 44, and strain B has 40, then 40/44\u224890.9% of the plumes come from B, meaning that recombination occurred 90.9% of the time. But none of the options match this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich again gives us 0.818\u2192 81.8%, which is still not matching the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B * n_K)\n\nPlugging in numbers: (40-4)/(40*4)=36/160=0.225\u219222.5%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.05%, because if the recombination frequency were that low, the difference in plumes wouldn't be as extreme. But that doesn't align with the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the reciprocal of the ratio. If strain B has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. Taking the natural log of 10 gives ln(10)=2.3026, which isn't relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nlog10(FR) = log10(n_B / n_K)\n\nWhich gives us log10(10) = 1 \u2192 FR=10^(1)=10, which is still too high.\n\nI'm really confused now. Given the options, the highest is 5%, followed by 0.5%. According to my previous calculation, the recombination frequency should be around 81.8%, but that's not an option. Maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich is 0.818\u219281.8%, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.05%, thinking that the difference in plumes implies a very low recombination rate. Or maybe the correct approach is to take the ratio of plumes and convert it to a percentage.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, which is 10 times more than strain K's 4. If the recombination happened 90% of the time, but none of the options match. Alternatively, if the recombination happened 5% of the time, then 40/44\u224890.9% would correspond to 90.9% recombination, which is still inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to conclude that despite the confusion, the most logical choice based on the experimental data and the provided options is that the recombination frequency is 5%, corresponding to option G. However, my calculations consistently show a much higher frequency, so perhaps I'm missing something fundamental.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, how do these dilutions work? Dilution affects the probability of the mutation being passed on. If you have a higher dilution, each phage has a lower chance of causing a lytic or lysogenic effect. So if one half is more dilute than the other, any mutations would be less likely to be expressed in that group. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage might be more effective at replicating, leading to more plasmid loss. But since it doesn't cause lytic fission, it might interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. Alternatively, maybe the two phages are crossing over, creating recombinant mutants that have both effects, making them more potent. \n\nThe key here is determining how often the mutations interact. The number of plasmids lost depends on whether the mutations are in the same or different regions. If they're recombined, the new phage will have both mutations, possibly leading to increased fitness. The observed difference in plume counts could indicate the likelihood of such interactions. \n\nLooking at the data, the strain B has 40 plumes, while strain K has 4. That seems like a significant difference, suggesting that the combination was more likely to occur where the mutations didn't interfere. Maybe the recombination rate is low enough that most cases don't produce a double mutant. \n\nRecombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of times two genes are exchanged during meiosis. In this scenario, if the mutations are recombined, it would lead to increased selection against the phage. However, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, the presence of the lysogenic phage might still dominate, especially in the B strain. \n\nAnother angle is considering the dilution factors. Plating on strain B's lawn with a higher dilution (1:10^7) means fewer phages, so the chance of cross-reacting with the lysogenic phage is lower. Strain K's lawn is less dilute, so more phages, potentially increasing the chances of recombination. \n\nGiven the high number of plumes on B (40) compared to K (4), it's possible that recombination occurred in a fraction of the cases. If the RF is low, say 0.02%, then only a small percentage of phages would exhibit recombination. This would explain why more plumes appeared in B than in K. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination. I think it refers to the percentage of time that the two mutations crossed over. If the RF is 0.02%, that's very low. However, sometimes experiments report this as the percentage of crossover events per gamete. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for expected plumes: if two mutations are present in a double mutant, the number of plasmid loss plumes is proportional to the product of their frequencies. But in this case, strain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. If the total number of plumes from both is 44, and assuming each mutation contributes independently, perhaps the RF is calculated based on the ratio of plumes. \n\nIf we consider the total number of plumes from both groups: 40 + 4 = 44. The number from K is 4, which is roughly 9% of the total. If this represents the proportion of cases where recombination occurred, then the RF would be approximately 9%. But that seems too high, especially given the options provided.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The recombination frequency can also be determined using the formula involving the number of plumes. The formula for calculating RF is:\n\nRF = (number of recombining plumes / total number of plumes) * 100%\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Alternatively, if the number of plumes on strain B is much higher than on strain K, it might suggest that the recombination happened frequently enough to affect the outcome. \n\nAnother approach is to calculate the log odds of recombination. The number of plumes can help estimate this. The formula is:\n\nlog10(RF) = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhere n_B is the number of plumes on strain B, and n_K is on strain K. Plugging in the numbers:\n\nn_B = 40, n_K = 4\n\nlog10(RF) = (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818\n\nSo RF \u2248 10^0.818 \u2248 6.6. That can't be right because RF should be between 0 and 100%.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake. Maybe the formula is different. Perhaps it's:\n\nlog10(RF) = (n_B - n_K)/n_total\n\nWhich would give:\n\n(40 - 4)/44 \u2248 0.818 \u2192 RF \u2248 6.6%\n\nThat's even worse. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps another way is to use the fact that the number of plumes indicates the probability of recombination. If strain B has 40 and strain K has 4, the difference is 36, which is 36/44 \u2248 0.818, meaning that about 82% of the cases involved recombination. But again, that doesn't make sense because RF is usually between 0-100, not percentages of cases.\n\nMaybe the correct formula is RF = (n_B - n_K)/n_total * 100\n\nWhich gives (36/44)*100 \u2248 81.8%, which is impossible because RF cannot exceed 100%. So clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me think differently. The presence of the lysogenic phage in E. coli strain B leads to plasmid loss because it doesn't lyse the cell. When both phages are present, some of the lysogenic phage may lose its lysogenic function due to recombination, allowing it to replicate without lytic fission. This would reduce the number of plasmid loss events, explaining why strain B had more plumes (more loss) and strain K had fewer (less loss).\n\nThe recombination frequency would determine how often the lysogenic phage's lysogenic function is lost. If recombination happens frequently, the lysogenic phage would replicate better, leading to more plasmid loss and more plumes. Conversely, low recombination would mean fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the difference is a factor of 10. This suggests that the recombination happened many times. However, looking back at the options, the highest is 5%, which is quite low. But according to the calculation earlier, RF is around 81.8%, which is way higher than any option provided except F (0.3%) and G (0.5%).\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my initial assumption about the formula might be incorrect. Perhaps I should use the formula for the probability of recombination:\n\np = (n_B + n_K) / (n_B * n_K)\n\nBut with n_B=40, n_K=4,\n\np = (40+4)/(40*4)=44/160=0.275 or 27.5%, which is still too high.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the probability of recombination occurring at least once in multiple trials is:\n\n1 - e^{-p}\n\nBut without knowing the number of trials, it's hard to apply.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plumes indicates the number of independent instances where recombination occurred. If there are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination happened 4 times more often on B than on K. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the difference in plumes reflects the difference in the recombination rates. If strain B shows 40 plumes and K shows 4, the recombination must have occurred significantly more often in B. Given the options, the closest is H (5%), but 5% seems low. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a scaling factor.\n\nWait, let me try calculating the log odds ratio. The number of plumes can be used to compute the log odds of recombination. The formula is:\n\nlog10(odds) = log10(n_B / n_K)\n\nWhich is log10(40/4) = log10(10) = 1 \u2192 Odds = 10^1 = 10 \u2192 RF = 10/(10+1) \u2248 9%. Again, 9% is way beyond any provided option, which makes me think I'm still misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nPerhaps instead of plumes, I should think about the relative numbers indicating the likelihood of recombination. For example, the number of plumes on B is 10 times higher than on K, which might imply a high recombination rate. But again, none of the options match 100%, so I must be off track.\n\nLet me think about what the question is asking directly: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" It wants the percentage of time that the mutations were recombined. From the experimental results, if the recombination is frequent, the number of plumes would reflect that. Since strain B has many more plumes, it suggests that recombination is happening frequently. However, the answer options don't include anything close to 100%. Therefore, perhaps the intended method is to calculate the logarithm of the ratio.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nlog10(FR) = (n_B - n_K)/(n_B + n_K)\n\nAs before, this gives (40-4)/(40+4)=36/44\u22480.818\u2192 FR\u22486.6%, which is still too low. Wait, no\u2014actually, I think I misapplied the formula. The correct formula for RF is:\n\nFR = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich is exactly what I did, giving 6.6%. Still, that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nFR = (n_B + n_K) / |n_B - n_K|\n\nBut that would be 44 / 36 \u2248 1.22, which is also not an option.\n\nHmm. Another approach is to look at the ratio of plumes on B to K: 40 vs 4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that recombination occurred 10 times more often on B than on K. If recombination occurs 10 times more often on B, and the total RF is 100%, then the frequency would be 100%. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\np = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich gives us 0.818, as before, meaning that about 81.8% of the time, recombination occurred. But that's more than all the options provide, so perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome.\"\n\nThe options are percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%. These seem extremely low, which contradicts the experimental observation where strain B has more plumes. Unless the recombination frequency is actually 5%, but that seems counterintuitive because the lysogenic phage shouldn't be affected much by recombination unless it introduces new mutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of the population where recombination occurred, rather than the overall RF. If 40 out of 44 cases involve recombination, that's about 90.9%, which is still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to take the difference in plumes and relate it to the recombination frequency using a specific equation. For instance, the number of plumes could be related to the recombination frequency through:\n\nplumes = (recombination frequency) \u00d7 (total number of phages)\n\nBut I'm not certain about this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes could represent the number of successful recombination events. If the recombination happens 40 times, and the total number of phages is 44, then the recombination frequency would be 40/44\u224890.9%, which again doesn't fit the options.\n\nAt this point, I'm realizing that perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the difference in plumes and interpret it as a measure of recombination. The difference is 36, and the total is 44, so 36/44\u22480.818, implying that recombination occurred 81.8% of the time. But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 0.02%, which is option I. But that seems too low because the difference is large.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / n_B\n\nWhich would be (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 0.9 \u2192 90%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, (n_B - n_K) / n_K = 36/4 = 9, which is 900%, which is not useful.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should reconsider the experimental design. Both strains are treated separately: one is plated on B, the other on K. The result is that B has more plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic phage on B is more likely to recombine. However, according to the options, the lowest is 0.02%, which seems too low given the significant difference in plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the difference in plumes relates to the number of times the recombination event occurred. Each time the lysogenic phage loses its lysogenic function, it can replicate without lytic fission. If this happens frequently, the lysogenic phage can replicate better, leading to more plasmid loss. Thus, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of times recombination occurred.\n\nTherefore, if strain B has 40 plumes and K has 4, the recombination must have occurred 40 times more often on B than on K. But how does that translate into a percentage?\n\nIf the total number of plumes is 44, and strain B has 40, then 40/44\u224890.9% of the plumes come from B, meaning that recombination occurred 90.9% of the time. But none of the options match this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich again gives us 0.818\u2192 81.8%, which is still not matching the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B * n_K)\n\nPlugging in numbers: (40-4)/(40*4)=36/160=0.225\u219222.5%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.05%, because if the recombination frequency were that low, the difference in plumes wouldn't be as extreme. But that doesn't align with the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the reciprocal of the ratio. If strain B has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. Taking the natural log of 10 gives ln(10)=2.3026, which isn't relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nlog10(FR) = log10(n_B / n_K)\n\nWhich gives us log10(10) = 1 \u2192 FR=10^(1)=10, which is still too high.\n\nI'm really confused now. Given the options, the highest is 5%, followed by 0.5%. According to my previous calculation, the recombination frequency should be around 81.8%, but that's not an option. Maybe I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nrecombination frequency = (n_B - n_K) / (n_B + n_K)\n\nWhich is 0.818\u219281.8%, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.05%, thinking that the difference in plumes implies a very low recombination rate. Or maybe the correct approach is to take the ratio of plumes and convert it to a percentage.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, which is 10 times more than strain K's 4. If the recombination happened 90% of the time, but none of the options match. Alternatively, if the recombination happened 5% of the time, then 40/44\u224890.9% would correspond to 90.9% recombination, which is still inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to conclude that despite the confusion, the most logical choice based on the experimental data and the provided options is that the recombination frequency is 5%, corresponding to option G. However, my calculations consistently show a much higher frequency, so perhaps I'm missing something fundamental.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, if it's mixed with strain K, maybe it doesn't affect as much?

If Group 2 is diluted less, you'd expect more plumes. But here Group 2 has more plumes than Group 1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial division splits the cells into two halves, each treated with one type of phage. So half the population is treated with lysogenic phages and placed on strain B's lawn, while the other half is treated with phages and placed on strain K's lawn. In this case, the number of plumes detected depends on whether the phages cause lysogeny or not. If the lysogenic phage kills the cell when placed on strain B, then the plume count would be lower. However, in this scenario, the presence of both phages leads to more plumes on K's lawn. This suggests that the lysogenic phage interacts with the other phage in a way that enhances its activity, possibly through recombination.\n\nRecombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. In this case, the lysogenic phage may integrate the mutation from the other phage into its own gene. The detection of recombination can be determined using methods like the F+ test, where the occurrence of a double-strand break in the lysogenic phage indicates that the mutation occurred during replication.\n\nThe experiment's results can help determine the percentage of recombination. The key is to look at how many plumes appear on each strain.

The probability of recombination can be estimated using the plume counts. For example, if the expected number of plumes without any recombination is 40, and with recombination, it's 60, then the percentage of recombination can be calculated accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the data, Group 1 (strain B) shows 4 plumes, and Group 2 (strain K) shows 40 plumes. The difference in plume numbers suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active when interacting with strain K's phage, implying that the mutation has been incorporated into the lysogenic phage. To calculate the exact percentage, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, all plumes would appear equally. However, due to recombination, the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of killing the host cell. Therefore, the number of plumes detected should decrease. Conversely, if there is significant recombination, the number of plumes will increase compared to the non-recombinant case.\n\nIn this experiment, since the lysogenic phage is causing problems when placed on strain B, but not as effectively on strain K, it suggests that the mutation has been integrated into the lysogenic phage. The number of plumes on strain K (40) compared to strain B (4) indicates that the mutation is significantly integrated. Using the F+ test formula, which is:\n\nP = 1 - e^{-2N_{\\text{obs}}}\n\nWhere N_obs is the observed number of double-strand breaks. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact calculation here.

    "rollout": " \n\nWait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Actually, the recombination refers to whether the two mutations cause each other's expression. So if one mutation affects the production of the other, you get recombination. In this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, perhaps it's causing recombination with the wild-type gene. Or maybe it's another way around. Let me try to remember how these experiments work.\n\nIn such assays, each mutation typically confers a certain fitness advantage. For example, the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of replicating without lysing the cell. If a second mutation confers an even greater advantage, like increased plasmid load, then you see more recombinant colonies. But here, we're seeing different dilutions leading to different numbers of plumes.\n\nThe key point is that when recombination occurs, it creates a double mutant phenotype. Here, when both types of phages are present, only the combination that causes the most disruption leads to the highest number of plumes. Since the lysogenic phage didn't lyse B, but when combined with another mutation, maybe it caused more disruption than just being present alone.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a big difference. Wait, actually, when the phages are present together, the lysogenic one isn't doing anything, so why would it cause more plumes? Maybe I'm thinking about it backwards. Perhaps the presence of one mutation makes the other less effective.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating the fitness effect of recombination. The fraction of cells expressing both mutants is given by (p + q - r), where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation, and r is their interference. But I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly here.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes depends on the relative fitness of the double mutant compared to the single mutants. If the double mutant is worse, you'd expect fewer plumes, but here we have more plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I got the direction wrong. Alternatively, the double mutant could be better, but that wouldn't make sense because the lysogenic phage shouldn't do anything.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. On B, there are 40 plumes, and on K, 4. 40 is ten times as many. But wait, when the phages are mixed, the double mutant should be worse than either single, right? Because if both are present, the double should be even worse than either one alone. However, in this case, the double mutant (on B) is worse than the single lysogenic one, but on K, it's better\u2014only 4 plumes instead of say 100. That doesn't fit because usually, double mutants are worse.\n\nBut according to the results, 40 on B and 4 on K. That suggests that when the double mutant is expressed (on B), it's more common, whereas the single lysogenic is less common. That would mean that the double mutant is actually less fit than the single lysogenic, which contradicts what I thought earlier. But why?\n\nMaybe because the double mutant requires both mutations, which aren't independent. So the occurrence is lower than expected if the mutations were completely independent. Therefore, the double mutant may actually be less fit, making it appear as if it's occurring less often, hence fewer plumes. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse B, so maybe the presence of recombination somehow compensates for the lack of lysis.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up the standard method for calculating recombination frequency from such experiments. From what I remember, the number of plumes gives an indication of the degree of recombination. Each additional plume represents a percentage increase in recombination. So, if the double mutant appears once every 100 plating disks, that's 1% recombination. But in our case, on B, it's 40 plumes, and on K, 4. That suggests that the double mutant is occurring more frequently on B, meaning less recombination, while on K, it's less frequent, meaning more recombination.\n\nBut the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse B, so why is the double mutant appearing more often on B? Maybe because the double mutant is actually a double mutant, and the phage is now expressed, causing more plating issues. Alternatively, perhaps the double mutant is actually a double mutant, and its occurrence correlates with the level of recombination.\n\nWait, I think the key is that when both mutations are present, the double mutant appears more frequently on the lawn because it's the product of both mutations. So the number of plumes indicates the strength of the recombination between the two mutations. The exact calculation might involve using the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination coefficient.\n\nLet me try to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for estimating the recombination frequency (\u03b8) from the number of plumes (N) is:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of plumes)/(total number of plumes + number of plumes)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Another approach is to use the formula N = (2^n * R)/M, where n is the number of mutations, R is the recombination coefficient, and M is the total number of possible combinations. But I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nGiven that the double mutant on B occurs 40 times and on K 4 times, let's assume that the total number of plating disks is the same for both, say 10^6. Then, the probability of a double mutant is proportional to the number of plumes. So, the probability on B is 40/10^6 = 0.00004, and on K it's 4/10^6 = 0.000004. \n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the probability of double mutant would be p*q = (0.00004)^2 = 0.00000016, but here it's much higher. Therefore, the mutations must be dependent, indicating recombination. The recombination coefficient \u03b8 can be estimated as:\n\n\u03b8 = p*q/(probability of double mutant)\n\nHere, p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. If both mutations occur independently, p = q = 0.00004, then p*q = 0.00000016. But the actual probability of double mutant is higher, so \u03b8 = 0.00000016 / 0.00000016 = 1, which doesn't help. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the number of plumes:\n\nNumber of plumes = (2^n * R)/(M * (M-1)) )\n\nBut I'm not confident in this either. Maybe I should refer to a standard formula. Oh, wait! I think the formula for the recombination coefficient \u03b8 is calculated as:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of double mutants) / (total number of possible double mutants)\n\nBut in this case, the total possible double mutants would be the sum of all single mutants and the double. However, since we don't know the total number of plating disks, perhaps it's easier to compare the ratios.\n\nThe ratio of double mutants on B to the sum of double and single mutants on B would give the recombination frequency. But since we don't have the totals, maybe the best estimate is that the double mutants are occurring at a rate determined by the product of the individual rates.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely related to the square of the number of mutations. Since the double mutant appeared 10 times more often on B than on K, that suggests that the recombination occurred 10 times more effectively on B. But I'm not sure how that translates to a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes increases by a factor equal to the number of possible combinations. If the double mutant occurs 10 times more often on B, that implies that the recombination frequency is high enough to produce 10 times as many double mutants as the product of the individual rates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of double mutants) / (total number of mutations)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to go back to basics. The number of plumes reflects the number of times the double mutant was observed. If the two mutations are independent, the probability of the double mutant is the product of their probabilities. If they're recombinant, this probability increases.\n\nFrom the data:\nOn B: Double mutant = 40 plumes\nOn K: Double mutant = 4 plumes\n\nAssuming the same number of plating disks, say N, then the probability of double mutant on B is 40/N, and on K is 4/N.\n\nIf the mutations were independent, then the expected double mutant probability would be (p*B)(q*K), assuming p is the proportion of double mutants on B and q on K. But this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of double mutants on B to K is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the double mutants occur 10 times more often on B. To find the recombination frequency, we can use the approximation that \u03b8 \u2248 sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16%, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination coefficient using the formula:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of double mutants)/(number of single mutants)\n\nBut again, without knowing the number of single mutants, it's tricky. Alternatively, the formula is:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of double mutants)/(total number of mutants)\n\nWhich would be \u03b8 = 40/(40+4) = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which is about 90%. That's not matching any option either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The presence of the lysogenic phage without lytic fission means it's causing recombination with the wild-type gene. When both types are present, the double mutant arises due to the combination of the two mutations. The number of plumes on each lawn tells us how often the double mutant appeared.\n\nSince on B, the double mutant appeared more often than on K, the recombination must have occurred sufficiently often on B. The exact value depends on how many times the double mutant was expressed. Given that the ratio is 10:1, perhaps the recombination is about 1.5%, as per one of the options.\n\nWait, another approach is to realize that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, if the double mutant appears 10 times more often on B than on K, the recombination frequency would be approximately 3.16%, which rounds to 3.16%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal is needed, giving about 0.316%, which is close to option F (0.3%) or J (0.05%).\n\nWait, looking back, I think I read somewhere that the recombination frequency can be approximated by taking the square root of the ratio of double mutants to singles. So, \u221a(40/4) = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16%, which is roughly 3.16%. But none of the options match exactly. The closest would be G (0.5%) or H (5%), but neither matches. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If the double mutant on B is 10 times more frequent than on K, then the recombination frequency is (\u221a(10)-1)*100% \u2248 31.6%, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\n\u03b8 = (1 - e^{-2\u03b8}) / (1 - e^{-\u03b8})\n\nBut without knowing \u03b8, this doesn't help. Maybe I should consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of double mutants, which is influenced by the recombination frequency. \n\nWait, I think I've heard before that the number of plumes relates to the recombination frequency squared. So, if the double mutant appears 10 times more often, then \u03b8^2 \u2248 10, so \u03b8 \u2248 3.16%. Again, not matching any options. Alternatively, maybe it's linear, so \u03b8 \u2248 10%, but that's also not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is C (1.5%). How did I arrive at that? Well, if the double mutants on B are 10 times more frequent than on K, and assuming the recombination frequency is small, maybe it's about 1.5%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the double mutants are 10 times more likely on B, then the recombination frequency might be sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16%, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the number of plumes as being proportional to the number of double mutants. Since on B, 40 vs. 4, that's 10 times more. So, the recombination frequency is such that the double mutant occurs 10 times more often on B. Assuming that the recombination frequency is low, perhaps around 1.5%.\n\nWait, let me check a reference. Oh, I think I remember that when the double mutant appears 10 times more often on one lawn than another, the recombination frequency is approximately 3.16%, which is about 3%. But the options don't include that. The closest is G (0.5%) or H (5%). Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to take the ratio of plumes and subtract 1. So, 40/4 = 10, minus 1 is 9, divided by 100, gives 9%, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's 10 times more, so the recombination frequency is sqrt(10)\u22483.16%, which rounds to 3%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is D (0.05%). Let me think differently. If the double mutant appears 10 times more often on B, then the recombination frequency is such that the double mutant is 10 times more likely. Using the formula for theta, which is the recombination frequency, we can write:\n\ntheta = ln(N_double / N_single) ?\n\nNo, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\ntheta = (ln(N_double + 1) - ln(N_single + 1)) / 2\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Maybe I should accept that the correct answer is C (1.5%) based on the reasoning that the double mutants are 10 times more frequent on B, implying a recombination frequency of about 1.5%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was closer to 3.16%, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B (2%) because the double mutants are 10 times more frequent, and the recombination frequency is approximately 2%, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, another angle: The number of plumes is proportional to the number of double mutants. If the double mutants on B are 10 times more than on K, that suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the double mutant appears 10 times more often. If the recombination frequency is 2%, then the double mutant would appear twice as often as the wild type, but in this case, it's 10 times more, which would imply a higher recombination frequency. Maybe around 5% (option J), which would lead to a doubling of the double mutant, but that's not 10 times. Alternatively, 10% would lead to more than 10 times. But since the options don't include 3%, maybe the intended answer is C (1.5%).\n\nI'm going to go with option C (1.5%) because the ratio suggests that the double mutants are 10 times more frequent on B, and 1.5% would account for that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Actually, the recombination refers to whether the two mutations cause each other's expression. So if one mutation affects the production of the other, you get recombination. In this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, perhaps it's causing recombination with the wild-type gene. Or maybe it's another way around. Let me try to remember how these experiments work.\n\nIn such assays, each mutation typically confers a certain fitness advantage. For example, the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of replicating without lysing the cell. If a second mutation confers an even greater advantage, like increased plasmid load, then you see more recombinant colonies. But here, we're seeing different dilutions leading to different numbers of plumes.\n\nThe key point is that when recombination occurs, it creates a double mutant phenotype. Here, when both types of phages are present, only the combination that causes the most disruption leads to the highest number of plumes. Since the lysogenic phage didn't lyse B, but when combined with another mutation, maybe it caused more disruption than just being present alone.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a big difference. Wait, actually, when the phages are present together, the lysogenic one isn't doing anything, so why would it cause more plumes? Maybe I'm thinking about it backwards. Perhaps the presence of one mutation makes the other less effective.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating the fitness effect of recombination. The fraction of cells expressing both mutants is given by (p + q - r), where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation, and r is their interference. But I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly here.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes depends on the relative fitness of the double mutant compared to the single mutants. If the double mutant is worse, you'd expect fewer plumes, but here we have more plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I got the direction wrong. Alternatively, the double mutant could be better, but that wouldn't make sense because the lysogenic phage shouldn't do anything.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. On B, there are 40 plumes, and on K, 4. 40 is ten times as many. But wait, when the phages are mixed, the double mutant should be worse than either single, right? Because if both are present, the double should be even worse than either one alone. However, in this case, the double mutant (on B) is worse than the single lysogenic one, but on K, it's better\u2014only 4 plumes instead of say 100. That doesn't fit because usually, double mutants are worse.\n\nBut according to the results, 40 on B and 4 on K. That suggests that when the double mutant is expressed (on B), it's more common, whereas the single lysogenic is less common. That would mean that the double mutant is actually less fit than the single lysogenic, which contradicts what I thought earlier. But why?\n\nMaybe because the double mutant requires both mutations, which aren't independent. So the occurrence is lower than expected if the mutations were completely independent. Therefore, the double mutant may actually be less fit, making it appear as if it's occurring less often, hence fewer plumes. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse B, so maybe the presence of recombination somehow compensates for the lack of lysis.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up the standard method for calculating recombination frequency from such experiments. From what I remember, the number of plumes gives an indication of the degree of recombination. Each additional plume represents a percentage increase in recombination. So, if the double mutant appears once every 100 plating disks, that's 1% recombination. But in our case, on B, it's 40 plumes, and on K, 4. That suggests that the double mutant is occurring more frequently on B, meaning less recombination, while on K, it's less frequent, meaning more recombination.\n\nBut the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse B, so why is the double mutant appearing more often on B? Maybe because the double mutant is actually a double mutant, and the phage is now expressed, causing more plating issues. Alternatively, perhaps the double mutant is actually a double mutant, and its occurrence correlates with the level of recombination.\n\nWait, I think the key is that when both mutations are present, the double mutant appears more frequently on the lawn because it's the product of both mutations. So the number of plumes indicates the strength of the recombination between the two mutations. The exact calculation might involve using the ratio of plumes to determine the recombination coefficient.\n\nLet me try to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for estimating the recombination frequency (\u03b8) from the number of plumes (N) is:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of plumes)/(total number of plumes + number of plumes)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Another approach is to use the formula N = (2^n * R)/M, where n is the number of mutations, R is the recombination coefficient, and M is the total number of possible combinations. But I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nGiven that the double mutant on B occurs 40 times and on K 4 times, let's assume that the total number of plating disks is the same for both, say 10^6. Then, the probability of a double mutant is proportional to the number of plumes. So, the probability on B is 40/10^6 = 0.00004, and on K it's 4/10^6 = 0.000004. \n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the probability of double mutant would be p*q = (0.00004)^2 = 0.00000016, but here it's much higher. Therefore, the mutations must be dependent, indicating recombination. The recombination coefficient \u03b8 can be estimated as:\n\n\u03b8 = p*q/(probability of double mutant)\n\nHere, p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. If both mutations occur independently, p = q = 0.00004, then p*q = 0.00000016. But the actual probability of double mutant is higher, so \u03b8 = 0.00000016 / 0.00000016 = 1, which doesn't help. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the number of plumes:\n\nNumber of plumes = (2^n * R)/(M * (M-1)) )\n\nBut I'm not confident in this either. Maybe I should refer to a standard formula. Oh, wait! I think the formula for the recombination coefficient \u03b8 is calculated as:\n\n\u03b8 = (number of double mutants) / (total number of possible double mutants)\n\nBut in this case, the total possible double mutants would be the sum of all single mutants and the double. However, since we don't know the total number of plating disks, perhaps it's easier to compare the ratios.\n\nThe ratio of double mutants on B to the sum of double and single mutants on B would give the recombination frequency.

Recombination would mean that the two mutations are combined, so the phage uses one mutation to cause lysis and the other for lysogeny. If there's no recombination, each mutation acts independently. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, maybe there's some recombination happening, allowing the lysogenic phage to use the lysogenic mutation more effectively.\n\nThe key here is probably looking at the distribution of recombinants. Each parent phage contributes one mutation. So if there are R recombinants, then the total number of offspring is 2R + 2 (the two original phages). Wait, actually, each phage has two copies of the mutation (one from each parent), so when they replicate, they can either combine the two mutations or have one copy each. The number of recombinant offspring depends on whether the combination allows the phage to function correctly.\n\nIn the first test, only the lysogenic phage caused problems, meaning most of the offspring didn't lyse the E. coli. But when both types are present, the E. coli with the lysogenic mutation using the phage's lysogenic mutation (since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse) would survive better. That suggests that the lysogenic phage has been successfully integrated with the lysogenic mutation, so it doesn't lyse the E. coli anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the probability of recombination. Since in the first case, only the lysogenic phage affected strain B, maybe the probability of recombination was low. But the second experiment shows that when both phages are present, the effect on strain B is less pronounced, indicating that some recombination happened. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of enough recombinant offspring might indicate the frequency of recombination. The formula I think is that the number of recombinant offspring (R) is approximately equal to N * p * q, where N is the total population, and p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that the number of recombinases determines how often these interactions occur. Recombination would mean that the two mutations are combined, so the phage uses one mutation to cause lysis and the other for lysogeny. If there's no recombination, each mutation acts independently. In this case, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, maybe there's some recombination happening, allowing the lysogenic phage to use the lysogenic mutation more effectively.\n\nThe key here is probably looking at the distribution of recombinants. Each parent phage contributes one mutation. So if there are R recombinants, then the total number of offspring is 2R + 2 (the two original phages). Wait, actually, each phage has two copies of the mutation (one from each parent), so when they replicate, they can either combine the two mutations or have one copy each. The number of recombinant offspring depends on whether the combination allows the phage to function correctly.\n\nIn the first test, only the lysogenic phage caused problems, meaning most of the offspring didn't lyse the E. coli. But when both types are present, the E. coli with the lysogenic mutation using the phage's lysogenic mutation (since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse) would survive better. That suggests that the lysogenic phage has been successfully integrated with the lysogenic mutation, so it doesn't lyse the E. coli anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the probability of recombination. Since in the first case, only the lysogenic phage affected strain B, maybe the probability of recombination was low. But the second experiment shows that when both phages are present, the effect on strain B is less pronounced, indicating that some recombination happened. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of enough recombinant offspring might indicate the frequency of recombination. The formula I think is that the number of recombinant offspring (R) is approximately equal to N * p * q, where N is the total population, and p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. But I'm not sure if that's exactly right.\n\nLooking back at the data: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. The dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

Recombination increases the chance that both mutation types will be expressed together, leading to better replication or activity. Without recombination, each mutation might act independently, reducing the likelihood of successful infection.\n\nThe dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. Dilution affects the probability of getting a successful infection. If you dilute too much, the chance of a successful infection decreases. Here, the first sample is 1:10^7, which means each well has 1e-7 of the original concentration. The second sample is 1:10^5, meaning 1e-5 of the original concentration. Since these are high dilutions, the chance of getting a single cell from the phage is low.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully replicated within the bacterial population. Each plume represents a successful infection event. On strain B, we saw fewer plumes (40) compared to strain K (4). This could mean that strain B was less likely to be replicated successfully, while strain K had higher success rates. However, since strain B was the one being plated on strain B's lawn, perhaps strain B's resistance to the phage caused lower replication success.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if both types of phage are present, the E. coli should replicate both mutations. So, without recombination, each mutation would have their own replication probabilities. With recombination, the two mutations would work together more efficiently, increasing the overall replication rate.\n\nThe expected outcome under complete recombination would be higher numbers of successful infections because the two mutations are working in concert. In this case, the observed numbers aren't extremely high, but maybe there's an effect due to recombination.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a big difference. Perhaps the recombination increased the replication efficiency enough to explain why there are so few successful infections on strain B. If the two mutations were independent, the replication success would depend on each mutation's individual probabilities. If they're recombined, the combined probability might be higher.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the replication probability for each mutation is p. Under independence, the total replication probability would be p_B * p_K. Under recombination, the effective probability would be p_B + p_K - (p_B * p_K), assuming the recombination increases the overall probability.\n\nBut wait, actually, the presence of recombination might increase the chance of both mutations being expressed together, thus increasing the replication success. Alternatively, it might affect the distribution of successful infections.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes under complete recombination versus no recombination. Without recombination, the replication probabilities are additive. With recombination, the probabilities combine multiplicatively.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the replication probabilities are p_B and p_K, then with recombination, the combined probability would be p_B + p_K - (p_B * p_K). Wait, that's similar to inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nBut in reality, the exact calculation depends on the specific probabilities of each mutation and whether they are independent. However, since the problem states that the mutations cause different outcomes (lysis vs. no lyso), it implies that they are not mutually exclusive and may interfere with each other.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage works against strain B, any recombination that allows the lysogenic phage to integrate with the lysogenic mutation in B would make the phage more effective. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage integrates with the non-lytic mutation, it wouldn't affect B.\n\nBut in the experiment, the failure on B is due to the lysogenic phage. So, the presence of recombination would allow the phage to express both mutations more effectively, thereby causing more successful infections on B than expected under independent replications.\n\nLooking at the data: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. This shows a significant difference, suggesting that the presence of recombination led to more efficient expression, explaining the reduced number of successful infections on B.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = ((Observed - Expected) / Expected) * 100\n\nBut what's the expected number? If there was no recombination, the replication would be additive. However, in reality, the expectation isn't straightforward because the presence of phages complicates things. Instead, perhaps I can look at the ratio of plumes on K to B.\n\nSince the plumes are proportional to the probability of successful replication, the ratio might indicate the effectiveness of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40, the ratio is 1:10. Maybe this reflects the impact of recombination, where the presence of recombination reduces the replication success on B relative to K.\n\nIf I assume that without recombination, the replication success on B would have been higher, say x, and with recombination, it becomes y. Then, y/x = 4/40 = 1/10. So, y = x/10, indicating a 90% reduction in replication success on B due to recombination.\n\nTo quantify this as a percentage of recombination, I can consider the change in replication probability. If the replication probability on B without recombination is P, then with recombination, it's Q = P - \u0394P.\n\nIf the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the replication probability (since fewer plumes mean lower probability of replication), then plumes on B (40) correspond to Q = 40/N, and on K (4) corresponds to P = 4/N, where N is the total number of plumes. The ratio is Q/P = 40/4 = 10. So Q = P/10.\n\nThis means that the replication probability decreased by a factor of 10 due to recombination. Assuming that the loss is due to recombination, the percentage decrease could be calculated.\n\nIf the original replication probability on B was P, and after recombination it's P/10, the percentage change is 90% decrease. But we need the percentage of recombination itself.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nPercentage of recombination = [(P - Q)/P] * 100\n\nWhere P is the replication probability without recombination, and Q is with recombination.\n\nFrom above, Q = P/10, so (P - Q)/P = (9P/10)/P = 90%. So 90% recombination. But this doesn't match the answer choices, which go up to 0.5%.\n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Maybe the ratio is not directly translating to the percentage of recombination. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes under complete recombination.\n\nSuppose without recombination, the number of successful infections on B would be N, and on K also N. With recombination, the number on B drops to 40, and on K remains 4. So the drop is 8 times.\n\nIf the number of plumes is proportional to the replication probability, then the replication probability on B is 10 times higher than on K. Therefore, the presence of recombination reduces the replication probability by a factor of 10.\n\nAssuming that the recombination contributes equally to both mutations, perhaps the percentage of recombination is such that it reduces the replication probability by 90%, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the frequency of plumes. On K, it's 4, on B, it's 40. So K's replication is 10 times more frequent than B's. This suggests that K has a higher replication success rate, possibly due to the lack of interference from recombination affecting B.\n\nIf the presence of recombination leads to a 10x reduction in replication success on B, that might imply a certain level of recombination. But calculating the exact percentage from this isn't straightforward.\n\nPerhaps another angle: if there was no recombination, the number of plumes would be the same for both strains. With recombination, the number on B is 40 and on K is 4. So the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that recombination made B's replication easier by 10 times.\n\nIf the replication probability on B is 10 times higher, the recombination must have occurred in a way that increased the effective replication probability by a factor of 10. Since the original replication probabilities might have been lower, perhaps the recombination increased the effective rate.\n\nBut without knowing the original probabilities, it's hard to compute the exact percentage. However, given the options, the closest plausible answer is D (0.1%) or F (0.3%). Since 10 times reduction isn't matching any standard percentages, perhaps it's intended to choose the smallest option, which is D (0.1%).\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination caused a 90% improvement, but that's not an option either. It's possible that the correct answer is G (0.5%), but I'm not sure. Given the data, the most logical choice based on the ratio is D (0.1%) or F (0.3%).

    "rollout": " \n\nHmm, so let's break this down. Recombination refers to the mixing of two genes, leading to new combinations. In phages, this would mean that if two mutations occur in different phages, they might cause the same effect when the phages multiply. So, in this case, since both mutantphages affect strain B differently than strain K, we're probably looking at how much their mutations have recombined.\n\nThe dilution factors indicate how concentrated each sample was. Dilution 1:10^7 means each well has 0.0000001 cells (since 1 part per million is 1e-6, so 1e-7 is 0.1e-6), while dilution 1:10^5 has higher concentration, 0.00001 cells. Since the half that was plated on strain K was more concentrated, any recombination would be more likely there.\n\nNow, the number of plumes (colonies) observed depends on whether the mutation occurred in the phage. If a mutation is present in both phages, then in the presence of strain B, you'd expect both phages to replicate without issues. But here, some colonies appear on strain K, suggesting that not all mutations are present in both phages. Wait, no\u2014strain B is being used for the first plate, and strain K for the second. So if both mutantphages are present, and some are causing problems in K, maybe that indicates recombination.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says that the result was \"sateis divided in half,\" meaning that half of the bacteria died. Then half of that (so a quarter of the original population) was plated on strain B's lawn and another quarter on strain K's. But according to the results, four colonies appeared on K and 40 on B. That seems high, but maybe due to the dilutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the experimental design. If both mutantphages are present, and some are causing issues in strain B, but others don't? Or perhaps it's about the effect of recombination. Maybe the number of plumes corresponds to the number of mutants in each phage.\n\nIf both mutantphages are present, and they cause problems in strain B, but not in K, perhaps that implies that the mutations are not independent but recombine. So, in the first plate, when both mutantphages are present, some might cause issues in strain B, and others might not. But the results show that 40 colonies appeared on strain B, which suggests that most of the phages didn't contribute to the issue. This could happen if the mutations are recombining, making certain phages carry one mutation and others the other, thus affecting the outcome differently.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. How do I calculate that from the data?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios:\n\n1. No recombination: Both mutations are present in both phages. So, in strain B, both mutations would cause issues, leading to more plumes. But in reality, only 40 plumes appeared on strain B, which is fewer than expected if both mutations were present in both phages. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the occurrence of the problematic effect. So, if the mutations are recombined, some phages may now carry both mutations, causing issues, while others carry none. Thus, when plated on strain B, the ones carrying the mutation(s) will die, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if recombination occurs, some plumes will survive, but others won't. However, in the given data, 40 plumes are on strain B, which is significantly less than expected under normal conditions. This suggests that recombination is happening because the plumes that would otherwise kill the bacteria are surviving, leading to fewer total plumes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes relates to the number of mutations present in each phage. For example, if each phage carries one mutation, and recombination happens, then each phage may carry either both mutations or neither. If they carry both, they would die; if neither, they would replicate, contributing to the plume count.\n\nSo, if recombination is occurring, then the number of plumes on strain B would depend on whether the phages are carrying the mutation or not. Since 40 plumes are on B, and the rest on K, it suggests that recombination is responsible for why some plumes survived and some didn't.\n\nTo find the amount of recombination, I think we can use the formula for the probability of recombination between two loci. The formula is p = 1 - (1 - q)^n, where q is the frequency of one mutation and n is the number of crosses or individuals. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If there's recombination, the number of plumes should reflect the reduced likelihood of replication caused by the mutated phages. Since 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination rate is such that 40% of the potential plumes (assuming no recombination) are killed, but with recombination, some survive, leading to the lower numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as follows:\n\nAssuming that each mutation independently reduces the chance of replication. Without recombination, both mutations would reduce replication. With recombination, perhaps only one mutation affects replication, reducing replication further.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the fraction of plumes that survive recombination as x. If x is low, fewer plumes survive, leading to fewer colonies on strain B. Given that 40 plumes appeared on B instead of, say, 80 (if both mutations reduced replication by half), x would be 0.5.\n\nIn our case, 40/80 = 0.5. So, x = 0.5. What does x represent? It's the probability that a phage carries at least one mutated gene. If x=0.5, then the recombination frequency is such that half the phages carry at least one mutation.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is typically expressed as the percentage of gametes where two loci are linked, which is related to the coefficient of coincidence (CC) or the interference (I). The formula for rf is:\n\nrf = 1 - (1 - I)\n\nwhere I is the interference, the proportion of recombinants over the expected number of non-recombinants.\n\nBut another way to estimate rf is using the formula:\n\nrf \u2248 2 * (1 - sqrt(p))\n\nwhere p is the probability of recombination between two loci. Here, p is the frequency of recombination, and 1 - sqrt(p) is the probability of recombination in one direction.\n\nGiven that x=0.5, which represents the probability of carrying at least one mutation, this might relate to the recombination frequency. Alternatively, if x is the probability that a phage carries both mutations, but with recombination, perhaps x is the probability that a phage carries at least one mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose the two mutations are on separate loci, and recombination occurs with a frequency r. Each phage has a 50% chance of carrying mutation A and a 50% chance of mutation B. The probability that a phage carries at least one mutation is 1 - (1 - r)^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the probability of recombination is r, so the probability of having at least one mutation is 1 - (1 - r)^2, since each locus has a 50% chance of mutation, and recombination can lead to double mutations.\n\nBut in reality, the probability that a phage carries at least one mutation is 1 - (probability of no mutation). The probability of no mutation is (1 - r_A)(1 - r_B), but if the mutations are linked, then it's just 1 - r.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the fraction of plumes that survive recombination is x. If x=0.5, then the recombination frequency is such that half of the phages carry at least one mutation. \n\nUsing the formula:\n\nx = 1 - (1 - r)^2\n\nHere, x is 0.5. Solving for r:\n\n0.5 = 1 - (1 - r)^2  \n(1 - r)^2 = 0.5  \n1 - r = sqrt(0.5) \u2248 0.707  \nr \u2248 1 - 0.707 \u2248 0.293\n\nSo, approximately 29.3% recombination frequency. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Another approach is to consider the number of plumes. On strain B, 40 plumes appeared, whereas on strain K, 4 plumes appeared. Total plumes are 44. But each half had 20 plumes (since 40 / 2 = 20 and 40 / 10^7 = 0.0000004). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the dilution factors help determine the frequency of mutations. Dilution factor 1:10^7 means each well has 1e-7 cells, which is 0.0000001 cells. Dilution 1:10^5 has 0.00001 cells.\n\nIf the mutation rate is proportional to the dilution factor, then the number of mutated phages would be higher in the more dilute samples. So, in the 1:10^7 dilution, there are more mutated phages, and in the 1:10^5, even more.\n\nSince 40 plumes appeared on strain B, which is more susceptible, perhaps more of the mutant phages are causing issues there. If the recombination leads to some phages carrying both mutations, they wouldn't cause issues, hence fewer plumes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinant mutations. If 40 plumes are on B and 4 on K, that suggests that 40% of the time, the phages carrying mutations would replicate successfully, while 60% would not. So, the recombination frequency would be 40%.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, so D (0.05%) or E (0.02%). But 40% isn't an option, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the number of plumes. Each plume corresponds to a successful replication event. If recombination occurs, some phages may not replicate successfully, leading to fewer plumes. If 40 plumes appeared on B, and assuming that 40% of the phages did not replicate (due to recombination), then the recombination frequency would be 40%. But again, that's not an option.\n\nPerhaps I'm supposed to calculate the recombination frequency based on the number of plumes. Let's assume that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K, perhaps the ratio is 10 times. If recombination happened, the number of plumes might decrease by a factor related to the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes on strain B is 10 times more than on K. That suggests that 40 = 10 * 4, so the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes decreases by a factor of 10. Using the formula for the effect of recombination on replication success, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor related to the recombination frequency. Assuming the relationship is linear, maybe the recombination frequency is 0.1 (1%), but that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options include D (0.05%) and E (0.02%). Perhaps the correct calculation gives around 0.05%. Alternatively, maybe the actual recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option D.\n\nWait, going back to the first approach, if x=0.5, and the formula gave r\u22480.293, which is roughly 0.3%, so option F. But none of the options match that closely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Maybe the 40 plumes correspond to the number of successful replication events, and the 4 on K correspond to failure.\n\nIf 40 plumes are successful on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes is 10 times less than expected without recombination. So, if without recombination, the number of plumes would be 40 * 10 = 400, but with recombination, it's 40. That doesn't make sense because recombination should increase plume numbers, not decrease them.\n\nWait, perhaps the opposite: if without recombination, the number of plumes would be 400, and with recombination, it's 40, indicating a decrease of 10 times. So, the recombination frequency would be such that the replication success is reduced by a factor of 10. The formula relating replication success to recombination frequency might be R = (1 - r)^2, where R is the replication success rate. If R drops by a factor of 10, then 40 = 400 / 10, so R = 40.\n\nWait, but that would imply that (1 - r)^2 = 40 / 400 = 0.1. Taking the square root, 1 - r = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, so r \u2248 0.684. That's a high recombination frequency, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for a simpler approach. Suppose that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombinant phages. If 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the number of recombinant phages is 10 times higher on B. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the number of recombinant phages increases by a factor of (1 + r), assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So, if without recombination, the number of recombinant phages is N, then with recombination, it's N*(1 + r). If the ratio on B is 10 times higher, then (1 + r)/N = 10*N/N = 10, so 1 + r = 10, which implies r = 9, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio is 10:1, meaning that the number of recombinant phages on B is 10 times that on K. If the recombination frequency is r, then the number of recombinant phages on B is proportional to r, while on K, it's proportional to (1 - r). But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that recombination leads to more successful replication when both mutations are present. So, if recombination occurs, some phages may have both mutations, leading to less plumes. But in this case, 40 plumes on B suggest that recombination is happening.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. The difference is 36. If the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency, then maybe the recombination frequency is 40 / (4 + 40) = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, which is close to 1, implying almost complete recombination, which doesn't fit the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So, 40 \u221d 1/r\u00b2, and 4 \u221d 1/r\u00b2, which would imply that r\u00b2 = 4/40 = 0.1, so r \u2248 0.316, which is about 0.3%, matching option F.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, the recombination frequency is approximately 0.3%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Problem: T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII cancause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let's break this down. Recombination refers to the mixing of two genes, leading to new combinations. In phages, this would mean that if two mutations occur in different phages, they might cause the same effect when the phages multiply. So, in this case, since both mutantphages affect strain B differently than strain K, we're probably looking at how much their mutations have recombined.\n\nThe dilution factors indicate how concentrated each sample was. Dilution 1:10^7 means each well has 0.0000001 cells (since 1 part per million is 1e-6, so 1e-7 is 0.1e-6), while dilution 1:10^5 has higher concentration, 0.00001 cells. Since the half that was plated on strain K was more concentrated, any recombination would be more likely there.\n\nNow, the number of plumes (colonies) observed depends on whether the mutation occurred in the phage. If a mutation is present in both phages, then in the presence of strain B, you'd expect both phages to replicate without issues. But here, some colonies appear on strain K, suggesting that not all mutations are present in both phages. Wait, no\u2014strain B is being used for the first plate, and strain K for the second. So if both mutantphages are present, and some are causing problems in K, maybe that indicates recombination.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says that the result was \"sateis divided in half,\" meaning that half of the bacteria died. Then half of that (so a quarter of the original population) was plated on strain B's lawn and another quarter on strain K's. But according to the results, four colonies appeared on K and 40 on B. That seems high, but maybe due to the dilutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the experimental design. If both mutantphages are present, and some are causing issues in strain B, but others don't? Or perhaps it's about the effect of recombination. Maybe the number of plumes corresponds to the number of mutants in each phage.\n\nIf both mutantphages are present, and they cause problems in strain B, but not in K, perhaps that implies that the mutations are not independent but recombine. So, in the first plate, when both mutantphages are present, some might cause issues in strain B, and others might not. But the results show that 40 colonies appeared on strain B, which suggests that most of the phages didn't contribute to the issue. This could happen if the mutations are recombining, making certain phages carry one mutation and others the other, thus affecting the outcome differently.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. How do I calculate that from the data?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios:\n\n1. No recombination: Both mutations are present in both phages. So, in strain B, both mutations would cause issues, leading to more plumes. But in reality, only 40 plumes appeared on strain B, which is fewer than expected if both mutations were present in both phages. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the occurrence of the problematic effect. So, if the mutations are recombined, some phages may now carry both mutations, causing issues, while others carry none. Thus, when plated on strain B, the ones carrying the mutation(s) will die, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if recombination occurs, some plumes will survive, but others won't. However, in the given data, 40 plumes are on strain B, which is significantly less than expected under normal conditions. This suggests that recombination is happening because the plumes that would otherwise kill the bacteria are surviving, leading to fewer total plumes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes relates to the number of mutations present in each phage. For example, if each phage carries one mutation, and recombination happens, then each phage may carry either both mutations or neither. If they carry both, they would die; if neither, they would replicate, contributing to the plume count.\n\nSo, if recombination is occurring, then the number of plumes on strain B would depend on whether the phages are carrying the mutation or not. Since 40 plumes are on B, and the rest on K, it suggests that recombination is responsible for why some plumes survived and some didn't.\n\nTo find the amount of recombination, I think we can use the formula for the probability of recombination between two loci. The formula is p = 1 - (1 - q)^n, where q is the frequency of one mutation and n is the number of crosses or individuals. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If there's recombination, the number of plumes should reflect the reduced likelihood of replication caused by the mutated phages. Since 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination rate is such that 40% of the potential plumes (assuming no recombination) are killed, but with recombination, some survive, leading to the lower numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as follows:\n\nAssuming that each mutation independently reduces the chance of replication. Without recombination, both mutations would reduce replication. With recombination, perhaps only one mutation affects replication, reducing replication further.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the fraction of plumes that survive recombination as x. If x is low, fewer plumes survive, leading to fewer colonies on strain B. Given that 40 plumes appeared on B instead of, say, 80 (if both mutations reduced replication by half), x would be 0.5.\n\nIn our case, 40/80 = 0.5. So, x = 0.5. What does x represent? It's the probability that a phage carries at least one mutated gene. If x=0.5, then the recombination frequency is such that half the phages carry at least one mutation.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is typically expressed as the percentage of gametes where two loci are linked, which is related to the coefficient of coincidence (CC) or the interference (I). The formula for rf is:\n\nrf = 1 - (1 - I)\n\nwhere I is the interference, the proportion of recombinants over the expected number of non-recombinants.\n\nBut another way to estimate rf is using the formula:\n\nrf \u2248 2 * (1 - sqrt(p))\n\nwhere p is the probability of recombination between two loci. Here, p is the frequency of recombination, and 1 - sqrt(p) is the probability of recombination in one direction.\n\nGiven that x=0.5, which represents the probability of carrying at least one mutation, this might relate to the recombination frequency. Alternatively, if x is the probability that a phage carries both mutations, but with recombination, perhaps x is the probability that a phage carries at least one mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose the two mutations are on separate loci, and recombination occurs with a frequency r. Each phage has a 50% chance of carrying mutation A and a 50% chance of mutation B. The probability that a phage carries at least one mutation is 1 - (1 - r)^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the probability of recombination is r, so the probability of having at least one mutation is 1 - (1 - r)^2, since each locus has a 50% chance of mutation, and recombination can lead to double mutations.\n\nBut in reality, the probability that a phage carries at least one mutation is 1 - (probability of no mutation). The probability of no mutation is (1 - r_A)(1 - r_B), but if the mutations are linked, then it's just 1 - r.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the fraction of plumes that survive recombination is x. If x=0.5, then the recombination frequency is such that half of the phages carry at least one mutation. \n\nUsing the formula:\n\nx = 1 - (1 - r)^2\n\nHere, x is 0.5. Solving for r:\n\n0.5 = 1 - (1 - r)^2  \n(1 - r)^2 = 0.5  \n1 - r = sqrt(0.5) \u2248 0.707  \nr \u2248 1 - 0.707 \u2248 0.293\n\nSo, approximately 29.3% recombination frequency. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Another approach is to consider the number of plumes. On strain B, 40 plumes appeared, whereas on strain K, 4 plumes appeared. Total plumes are 44. But each half had 20 plumes (since 40 / 2 = 20 and 40 / 10^7 = 0.0000004). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the dilution factors help determine the frequency of mutations. Dilution factor 1:10^7 means each well has 1e-7 cells, which is 0.0000001 cells. Dilution 1:10^5 has 0.00001 cells.\n\nIf the mutation rate is proportional to the dilution factor, then the number of mutated phages would be higher in the more dilute samples. So, in the 1:10^7 dilution, there are more mutated phages, and in the 1:10^5, even more.\n\nSince 40 plumes appeared on strain B, which is more susceptible, perhaps more of the mutant phages are causing issues there. If the recombination leads to some phages carrying both mutations, they wouldn't cause issues, hence fewer plumes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinant mutations. If 40 plumes are on B and 4 on K, that suggests that 40% of the time, the phages carrying mutations would replicate successfully, while 60% would not. So, the recombination frequency would be 40%.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, so D (0.05%) or E (0.02%). But 40% isn't an option, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of the number of plumes. Each plume corresponds to a successful replication event. If recombination occurs, some phages may not replicate successfully, leading to fewer plumes. If 40 plumes appeared on B, and assuming that 40% of the phages did not replicate (due to recombination), then the recombination frequency would be 40%. But again, that's not an option.\n\nPerhaps I'm supposed to calculate the recombination frequency based on the number of plumes. Let's assume that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K, perhaps the ratio is 10 times. If recombination happened, the number of plumes might decrease by a factor related to the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes on strain B is 10 times more than on K. That suggests that 40 = 10 * 4, so the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes decreases by a factor of 10. Using the formula for the effect of recombination on replication success, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor related to the recombination frequency. Assuming the relationship is linear, maybe the recombination frequency is 0.1 (1%), but that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options include D (0.05%) and E (0.02%).
