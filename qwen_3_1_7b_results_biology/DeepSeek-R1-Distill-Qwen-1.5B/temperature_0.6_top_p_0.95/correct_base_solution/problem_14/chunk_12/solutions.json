    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, if you have 40 plumes on B, that means 40 phages successfully caused a lytic fission (since B isn't lysogenic), and 40 phages on K are from the lysogenic type, meaning they didn't lyse B cells.",
    "rollout": " So, if you have 40 plumes on B, that means 40 phages successfully caused a lytic fission (since B isn't lysogenic), and 40 phages on K are from the lysogenic type, meaning they didn't lyse B cells.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. In the first case, where the phages are plated on B's lawn, only the lysogenic phages would cause issues because B isn't lysogenic. So any phages that don't lyse B would die, right? But in the second case, when the phages are plated on K's lawn, they're lysogenic, so they should lyse K cells. So in the first dilution, maybe the number of successful infections depends on the presence of both types. Since only one type (lysogenic) affects B, while the other (lytic) affects K, perhaps the way the phages are mixed determines how many times each mutation occurs.\n\nThe key here is probably the concept of recombinant phages causing cross-infections. If the two mutants are recombined, then when they mix, more than just one type will affect either strain. Alternatively, the frequency of successful infections can indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nLet me think about the math. When you mix two sets of phages, the probability that a phage from set A mixes with a phage from set B is related to their recombination rate. For example, if the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of times a phage from set A mixes with a phage from set B is proportional to R.\n\nIn this experiment, the initial population is split into two groups: one with a high dilution (1:10^7) and another with a lower dilution (1:10^5). The number of plumes on each lawn corresponds to the number of successful infections. On B's lawn, we saw 4 plumes (lytic phages from lysogenic), and on K's lawn, 40 plumes (lytic phages from lysogenic on B). Hmm, wait, that seems counterintuitive because lysogenic phages shouldn't infect B anyway. Maybe I got it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple phages leads to more interactions. Since the initial concentrations are different, the mixing ratio changes the outcome. The number of plumes on each lawn might relate to the product of the concentrations of the two phage types.\n\nSo, if the concentration of lysogenic phages is C1 and the lysine phage is C2, then the expected number of successful infections on the B lawn would be C1 * C2, assuming no interference. Similarly, on the K lawn, it would be C2 * C1 (but C1 for lysogenics and C2 for lysine? Or vice versa). Wait, maybe it's the product of their concentrations that gives the total number of interactions.\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\nOn B's lawn: 4 plumes = C1 * C2 = 4\n\nOn K's lawn: 40 plumes = C2 * C1 = 40\n\nBut wait, that would mean C1*C2=4 and C2*C1=40, which can't both be true unless I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the concentrations are inversely related to the dilutions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the concentration of each phage type is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, the concentration of lysogenic phages (from the lysogenic type) is higher in the B-diluted sample, and vice versa for the K-diluted sample.\n\nLet me try setting up equations. Suppose the initial concentration of lysogenic phages is C1 and lysine phages is C2. When plated on B's lawn at a certain dilution, say D_b, the expected number of infections (plumes) would be C1 * C2 / (D_b * N_total), where N_total is the total number of phages. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of successful interactions between the two phage types is C1 * C2 * (1 - r), where r is the recombination rate. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky.\n\nLooking back at the problem, when both phages are present, the number of plumes on each lawn indicates the effectiveness of each. On B's lawn, only lysogenic phages are present, so they cause lytic fission (plumes). On K's lawn, lysine phages are present, which cause lysogenic fission (lytic?), but since they're on K, which is lysogenic, they lyse K cells. However, the number of plumes is much higher on K's lawn, suggesting that more phages are infecting K cells despite being lysogenic. That doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages should lyse all cells. Unless... maybe the phages are not compatible with the host genome?\n\nWait, but lysogenic phages typically require a specific promoter and are compatible with the host genome, unlike lysogenic phages which use CRISPR systems. No, wait, phage types are usually classified as lysogenic (use CRISPR-Cas) vs. paralysed (lytic). Lysogenic phages are compatible with the host genome, whereas lysine phages are often considered paralysed because they lack a functional integrase.\n\nHmm, going back to the original description: T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. These mutations could allow them to function as either lysogenic or paralysed. Lysogenic phages require a specific promoter and are compatible with the host genome, leading to lysis upon replication. Paralysed phages lyse the host cell before replicating, so they cause fewer infections.\n\nIn this experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present (on B's lawn), they cause lytic fission, leading to plumes. When lysine phages are present (on K's lawn), they cause lysogenic fission, but since K is lysogenic, they should lyse K cells. But the number of plumes on K's lawn is higher than on B's. That suggests that more phages are infecting K cells, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe lysine phages are not compatible with K's genome or are active regardless of the host cell state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lytic fission by lysine phages on K's cells is not effective because lysine phages are typically paralysed, meaning they lyse the cell before replicating. So if the phage is lysine, even if present, it shouldn't lyse K cells. Therefore, why would the number of plumes on K's lawn be higher than on B's? That doesn't add up.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read it again: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was on B's lawn, expecting only lysogenic phages to cause lytic fission. The second half was on K's lawn, expecting lysine phages to lyse K cells, hence more plumes. But according to the results, 40 plumes on K's lawn, which is much higher than 4 on B's. That seems inconsistent because lysine phages shouldn't affect K cells.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the phages are not compatible with the host. So when lysine phages are present, they don't lyse K cells, but also don't replicate well because they're paralysed. But in the experiment, they do lyse K cells, leading to more plumes. This suggests that the phage is somehow able to lyse K cells despite being lysine. Perhaps due to compatibility or some other reason.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the experiment wasn't conducted properly, but given the data, we have to proceed. So, perhaps the higher number of plumes on K's lawn indicates that more phages are infecting K cells. But if lysine phages are supposed to lyse K cells, maybe there's an error in the setup. Alternatively, maybe the phages can infect K cells regardless of their compatibility.\n\nAssuming that, let's model the numbers. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- On B's lawn: number of plumes = C1 * C2 = 4\n\n- On K's lawn: number of plumes = C2 * C1 = 40\n\nBut this implies C1 * C2 = 4 and C2 * C1 = 40, which can\u2019t both be true unless there's a mistake in interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when both types are present, the number of interactions is C1 * C2, but since some may not interact (due to non-compatibility), the actual number of plumes is less. Alternatively, the number of plumes is equal to the number of interactions minus some fraction due to non-reactivity.\n\nBut maybe the expected number of plumes on each lawn is proportional to the product of the concentrations. Given that, if we assume that the concentration of lysogenic phages is C1 and lysine phages is C2, then on B's lawn (only lysogenic present), the expected number of plumes would be C1 * N_B, where N_B is the total number of phages on B's lawn. Similarly, on K's lawn, the expected number of plumes would be C2 * N_K.\n\nHowever, since the phages are mixed, the actual number of interactions would be influenced by the proportion of each type. The observed number of plumes on B's lawn is 4, which equals C1 * (N_B / N_total), and on K's lawn, it's 40 = C2 * (N_K / N_total).\n\nBut without knowing N_total, N_B, N_K, etc., this becomes too vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ratio of plumes on K's lawn to B's lawn is 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the concentration of lysine phages is ten times that of lysogenic phages. Since lysine phages are on the lower dilution (1:10^5), their concentration is higher relative to lysogenic phages on the higher dilution (1:10^7). Thus, C2 > C1 by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, the recombination rate R is given by 1 - (C1 + C2)/(C1 + C2 + R). But without knowing R, it's hard to calculate directly.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination fraction F is related to the recombination rate R as F = 1 - e^{-R}. But again, without knowing F, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probabilities. If the two phage types are recombined, the chance that a randomly selected phage is a lysogenic one from the lysine source is C2, and similarly, the chance it's a lysine one from the lysogenic source is C1. The probability that a phage is from the same source as another phage is R/(1+R), but this is getting convoluted.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to use the formula for the number of plumes. The expected number of plumes on a lawn is approximately the product of the concentrations of the two phage types. If the concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilutions, then:\n\nConcentration of lysogenic phages on B's lawn: C1_B = k / (10^7)\n\nConcentration of lysine phages on B's lawn: C2_B = k / (10^7)\n\nSimilarly, on K's lawn:\n\nConcentration of lysogenic phages: C1_K = k / (10^5)\n\nConcentration of lysine phages: C2_K = k / (10^5)\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes on B's lawn would be C1_B * C2_B = (k/10^7)^2\n\nAnd on K's lawn: C1_K * C2_K = (k/10^5)^2\n\nBut we know that on B's lawn, the number of plumes is 4, and on K's it's 40. So,\n\n(k^2)/(10^{14}) = 4 \u2192 k^2 = 4 * 10^{14} \u2192 k = sqrt(4e14) \u2248 6.32e7\n\nSimilarly, on K's lawn:\n\n(k^2)/(10^{10}) = 40 \u2192 k^2 = 40e10 \u2192 k = sqrt(4e12) \u2248 6.32e6\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumption is incorrect. Perhaps the actual relation is different.\n\nAnother angle: If the two phage types recombine, then the number of interactions increases beyond the product of individual concentrations. The observed increase in plumes on K's lawn compared to B's might indicate that the recombination rate is high enough to significantly affect the outcomes.\n\nIf the recombination rate R is such that the probability of a phage from lysine being paired with a phage from lysogenic on the same line is R, then the expected number of plumes would be (C1 + C2) * (C1 + C2) * R / (C1 + C2 + R). But this is quite complex.\n\nAlternatively, the number of successful interactions between the two phage types is proportional to R, so the expected number of plumes would be (C1 * C2) * R.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nNumber of plumes on B's lawn: 4 = (C1 * C2) * R\n\nNumber of plumes on K's lawn: 40 = (C2 * C1) * R\n\nWait, but that would imply 4 = 40, which is impossible. Hence, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is that the number of plumes is equal to (C1 * C2) * (1 - R). Then,\n\nFor B's lawn: 4 = (C1 * C2) * (1 - R)\n\nFor K's lawn: 40 = (C2 * C1) * (1 - R)\n\nAgain, this suggests 4 = 40, which is impossible. So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two types of phages. Since the concentration of each type is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, let's define:\n\nOn B's lawn: C1_B = k / (10^7), C2_B = k / (10^7)\n\nThus, plumes_B = C1_B * C2_B = k^2 / (10^{14}) = 4 \u2192 k^2 = 4e14 \u2192 k = 6.32e7\n\nOn K's lawn: C1_K = k / (10^5), C2_K = k / (10^5)\n\nThus, plumes_K = C1_K * C2_K = k^2 / (10^{10}) = 40 \u2192 k^2 = 4e12 \u2192 k = 6.32e6\n\nBut this is inconsistent because k cannot change; it's the same k used for both experiments. So, this suggests that my model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the concentrations are independent, and the number of plumes is simply proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two types. So, on B's lawn, the number of plumes is C1 * C2 = 4. On K's lawn, it's C2 * C1 = 40. But again, this would mean 4 = 40, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual relationship is that the number of plumes is proportional to (C1 + C2). Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the number of plumes is proportional to (C1 + C2):\n\nPlumes_B = (C1_B + C2_B) * constant = 4\n\nPlumes_K = (C1_K + C2_K) * constant = 40\n\nSince C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7, so sum is 2k / 10^7.\n\nSimilarly, C1_K = k / 10^5, C2_K = k / 10^5, sum is 2k / 10^5.\n\nThus,\n\n4 = (2k / 10^7) * constant\n\n40 = (2k / 10^5) * constant\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = ( (2k / 10^5) / (2k / 10^7) ) * (constant / constant)\n\nWhich simplifies to 10 = (10^7 / 10^5) = 10^2 = 100\n\nBut 10 \u2260 100, so this is inconsistent. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations, scaled by some factor.\n\nAssume Plumes = (C1 * C2) * R, where R is the recombination rate.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = (C1_B * C2_B) * R\n\n40 = (C1_K * C2_K) * R\n\nBut C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7\n\nC1_K = k / 10^5, C2_K = k / 10^5\n\nSubstituting:\n\n4 = (k^2 / 10^{14}) * R\n\n40 = (k^2 / 10^{10}) * R\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = ( (k^2 / 10^{10}) / (k^2 / 10^{14}) ) * (R / R )\n\nSimplify:\n\n10 = (10^{14} / 10^{10}) ) = 10^4 = 10000\n\nBut 10 \u2260 10000, so contradiction again. Thus, this method doesn't work.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the recombination affects the number of successful interactions. If the recombination rate R is high, the number of interactions increases, thus increasing the number of plumes.\n\nThe number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations multiplied by (1 - R). So,\n\nPlumes = (C1 * C2) * (1 - R)\n\nBut on B's lawn, it's 4 = (C1_B * C2_B) * (1 - R)\n\nOn K's lawn, 40 = (C1_K * C2_K) * (1 - R)\n\nBut substituting C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7\n\nC1_K = k / 10^",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So, if you have 40 plumes on B, that means 40 phages successfully caused a lytic fission (since B isn't lysogenic), and 40 phages on K are from the lysogenic type, meaning they didn't lyse B cells.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. In the first case, where the phages are plated on B's lawn, only the lysogenic phages would cause issues because B isn't lysogenic. So any phages that don't lyse B would die, right? But in the second case, when the phages are plated on K's lawn, they're lysogenic, so they should lyse K cells.

The number of plumes on each lawn corresponds to the number of successful infections. On B's lawn, we saw 4 plumes (lytic phages from lysogenic), and on K's lawn, 40 plumes (lytic phages from lysogenic on B).

So, the concentration of lysogenic phages (from the lysogenic type) is higher in the B-diluted sample, and vice versa for the K-diluted sample.\n\nLet me try setting up equations. Suppose the initial concentration of lysogenic phages is C1 and lysine phages is C2. When plated on B's lawn at a certain dilution, say D_b, the expected number of infections (plumes) would be C1 * C2 / (D_b * N_total), where N_total is the total number of phages.

That suggests that more phages are infecting K cells, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe lysine phages are not compatible with K's genome or are active regardless of the host cell state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lytic fission by lysine phages on K's cells is not effective because lysine phages are typically paralysed, meaning they lyse the cell before replicating. So if the phage is lysine, even if present, it shouldn't lyse K cells. Therefore, why would the number of plumes on K's lawn be higher than on B's? That doesn't add up.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read it again: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was on B's lawn, expecting only lysogenic phages to cause lytic fission. The second half was on K's lawn, expecting lysine phages to lyse K cells, hence more plumes. But according to the results, 40 plumes on K's lawn, which is much higher than 4 on B's. That seems inconsistent because lysine phages shouldn't affect K cells.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the phages are not compatible with the host. So when lysine phages are present, they don't lyse K cells, but also don't replicate well because they're paralysed. But in the experiment, they do lyse K cells, leading to more plumes.

Given that, if we assume that the concentration of lysogenic phages is C1 and lysine phages is C2, then on B's lawn (only lysogenic present), the expected number of plumes would be C1 * N_B, where N_B is the total number of phages on B's lawn. Similarly, on K's lawn, the expected number of plumes would be C2 * N_K.\n\nHowever, since the phages are mixed, the actual number of interactions would be influenced by the proportion of each type. The observed number of plumes on B's lawn is 4, which equals C1 * (N_B / N_total), and on K's lawn, it's 40 = C2 * (N_K / N_total).\n\nBut without knowing N_total, N_B, N_K, etc., this becomes too vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ratio of plumes on K's lawn to B's lawn is 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the concentration of lysine phages is ten times that of lysogenic phages. Since lysine phages are on the lower dilution (1:10^5), their concentration is higher relative to lysogenic phages on the higher dilution (1:10^7). Thus, C2 > C1 by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, the recombination rate R is given by 1 - (C1 + C2)/(C1 + C2 + R).

The probability that a phage is from the same source as another phage is R/(1+R), but this is getting convoluted.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to use the formula for the number of plumes. The expected number of plumes on a lawn is approximately the product of the concentrations of the two phage types. If the concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilutions, then:\n\nConcentration of lysogenic phages on B's lawn: C1_B = k / (10^7)\n\nConcentration of lysine phages on B's lawn: C2_B = k / (10^7)\n\nSimilarly, on K's lawn:\n\nConcentration of lysogenic phages: C1_K = k / (10^5)\n\nConcentration of lysine phages: C2_K = k / (10^5)\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes on B's lawn would be C1_B * C2_B = (k/10^7)^2\n\nAnd on K's lawn: C1_K * C2_K = (k/10^5)^2\n\nBut we know that on B's lawn, the number of plumes is 4, and on K's it's 40. So,\n\n(k^2)/(10^{14}) = 4 \u2192 k^2 = 4 * 10^{14} \u2192 k = sqrt(4e14) \u2248 6.32e7\n\nSimilarly, on K's lawn:\n\n(k^2)/(10^{10}) = 40 \u2192 k^2 = 40e10 \u2192 k = sqrt(4e12) \u2248 6.32e6\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumption is incorrect. Perhaps the actual relation is different.\n\nAnother angle: If the two phage types recombine, then the number of interactions increases beyond the product of individual concentrations. The observed increase in plumes on K's lawn compared to B's might indicate that the recombination rate is high enough to significantly affect the outcomes.\n\nIf the recombination rate R is such that the probability of a phage from lysine being paired with a phage from lysogenic on the same line is R, then the expected number of plumes would be (C1 + C2) * (C1 + C2) * R / (C1 + C2 + R). But this is quite complex.\n\nAlternatively, the number of successful interactions between the two phage types is proportional to R, so the expected number of plumes would be (C1 * C2) * R.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nNumber of plumes on B's lawn: 4 = (C1 * C2) * R\n\nNumber of plumes on K's lawn: 40 = (C2 * C1) * R\n\nWait, but that would imply 4 = 40, which is impossible. Hence, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is that the number of plumes is equal to (C1 * C2) * (1 - R). Then,\n\nFor B's lawn: 4 = (C1 * C2) * (1 - R)\n\nFor K's lawn: 40 = (C2 * C1) * (1 - R)\n\nAgain, this suggests 4 = 40, which is impossible. So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: The number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two types of phages. Since the concentration of each type is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, let's define:\n\nOn B's lawn: C1_B = k / (10^7), C2_B = k / (10^7)\n\nThus, plumes_B = C1_B * C2_B = k^2 / (10^{14}) = 4 \u2192 k^2 = 4e14 \u2192 k = 6.32e7\n\nOn K's lawn: C1_K = k / (10^5), C2_K = k / (10^5)\n\nThus, plumes_K = C1_K * C2_K = k^2 / (10^{10}) = 40 \u2192 k^2 = 4e12 \u2192 k = 6.32e6\n\nBut this is inconsistent because k cannot change; it's the same k used for both experiments. So, this suggests that my model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the concentrations are independent, and the number of plumes is simply proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two types. So, on B's lawn, the number of plumes is C1 * C2 = 4. On K's lawn, it's C2 * C1 = 40. But again, this would mean 4 = 40, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual relationship is that the number of plumes is proportional to (C1 + C2). Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the number of plumes is proportional to (C1 + C2):\n\nPlumes_B = (C1_B + C2_B) * constant = 4\n\nPlumes_K = (C1_K + C2_K) * constant = 40\n\nSince C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7, so sum is 2k / 10^7.\n\nSimilarly, C1_K = k / 10^5, C2_K = k / 10^5, sum is 2k / 10^5.\n\nThus,\n\n4 = (2k / 10^7) * constant\n\n40 = (2k / 10^5) * constant\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = ( (2k / 10^5) / (2k / 10^7) ) * (constant / constant)\n\nWhich simplifies to 10 = (10^7 / 10^5) = 10^2 = 100\n\nBut 10 \u2260 100, so this is inconsistent. Hence, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations, scaled by some factor.\n\nAssume Plumes = (C1 * C2) * R, where R is the recombination rate.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = (C1_B * C2_B) * R\n\n40 = (C1_K * C2_K) * R\n\nBut C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7\n\nC1_K = k / 10^5, C2_K = k / 10^5\n\nSubstituting:\n\n4 = (k^2 / 10^{14}) * R\n\n40 = (k^2 / 10^{10}) * R\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = ( (k^2 / 10^{10}) / (k^2 / 10^{14}) ) * (R / R )\n\nSimplify:\n\n10 = (10^{14} / 10^{10}) ) = 10^4 = 10000\n\nBut 10 \u2260 10000, so contradiction again. Thus, this method doesn't work.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the recombination affects the number of successful interactions. If the recombination rate R is high, the number of interactions increases, thus increasing the number of plumes.\n\nThe number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations multiplied by (1 - R). So,\n\nPlumes = (C1 * C2) * (1 - R)\n\nBut on B's lawn, it's 4 = (C1_B * C2_B) * (1 - R)\n\nOn K's lawn, 40 = (C1_K * C2_K) * (1 - R)\n\nBut substituting C1_B = k / 10^7, C2_B = k / 10^7\n\nC1_K = k / 10^",

In phages, especially T_4, if two mutations are present, their effect can be either additive or dominant depending on whether they interfere with each other. If they're in the same gene (like in a different sense), they might cause independent events, but if they are in different genes, perhaps they interfere.\n\nIn the initial scenario, when only the lysogenic phage is present, it lyses strain B, causing lytic fission.

This would mean that the lysogenic phage can integrate its mutation into the lysogen of another phage, potentially disrupting the lysogenic machinery of the host. However, if the two mutations are in the same gene, this might lead to a double-strand break upon integration, which could disrupt the lysogen, making the phage more effective at lysing both strains. Alternatively, if the mutations are in different genes, the phage might have a harder time integrating, but given that it's a single T_4 phage, I'm thinking about the possibility of interference rather than direct integration.\n\nWait, no, T_4 phages are known for having a single locus where they can mutate.

That suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective against strain B. So the lysogenic phage might be more successful at killing strain B because it integrates better into the lysogen? Or perhaps it's more efficient at integrating into the lysogen of strain B, meaning it can replicate without interfering with strain K's lysogen. But wait, if both are lysogenic, they should both replicate independently, leading to more plumes regardless. Hmm, but the numbers don't add up. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, while on strain K, there are only 4. So the lysogenic phage must be causing more damage on strain B, implying that it's working better against strain B.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage has a higher efficiency in replicating within strain B's lysogen, possibly due to the presence of a functional mutation that enhances replication within that specific lysogen.

Wait, but both are lysogenic, so they shouldn't interfere.

But in this case, strain K had only 4 plumes, which seems lower than expected if both are lysogenic. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces its own growth rate, but that wouldn't directly cause the difference in plumes between the two cultures.\n\nAnother angle: the recombination frequency refers to the likelihood that two mutations occur in the same gene.

    "rollout": " So 40 on B mean 40 infections, and 4 on K mean 4 infections.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Each bacterium that gets infected will produce a phage. So if you have 40 plumes on B's lawn, that means 40 phages (infections) occurred on B. Similarly, 4 on K mean 4 phages on K's lawn. But why would we see more on B? Because maybe the phages from the other half (the 1:10^5 dilution) are more effective at infecting B than K?\n\nHmm, perhaps the presence of multiple phages affects the growth. Alternatively, maybe the presence of lysogenic phages allows them to infect both strains, while lysogenic ones cause lytic fission only on their own host. Since the lysogenic phage causes damage only on strain B, the presence of the other type might affect how well they grow, leading to more or fewer infections.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So the lysogenic phage should kill strain B, but the other mutation should just die without affecting strain K. Maybe the interaction between the two mutations leads to some kind of competition where they prevent each other from growing as effectively.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple phages could lead to some form of selection or interference, affecting the number of viable phages. If the lysogenic phage is able to replicate without causing lytic fission, then it might survive better and infect more bacteria, but in reality, lysogenic phages do cause lytic fission, so they die after replication.\n\nWait, but the initial test showed that lysogenic phages cause lytic fission only on strain B. So in the first experiment, the lysogenic phage kills strain B, leaving only strain K intact. However, when both mutants are present, strain B is partially lysed, meaning only part of the phages are killing it, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is somehow surviving and infecting some cells, while others don't get killed. That could happen due to the presence of the other mutation, the lysogenic one, which doesn't cause death but may interfere with growth.\n\nSo, perhaps the lysogenic phage (mutant A) can replicate without causing lytic fission, thus allowing it to infect some cells even when the lysogenic phage (mutant B) is present. This would result in some of the lysogenic phage being active despite the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, the number of phages that can infect strain B is higher when both mutants are present, leading to more plasmid loss and less of a clear area on the lawn.\n\nIn the experiment, the majority of the phages on strain B's lawn (40 plumes) indicate that the lysogenic mutation is still present because it can infect some cells. On the other hand, the few plumes on strain K (4) suggest that the lysogenic mutation isn't as effective in preventing infection on strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect strain K, or that there's some mutation preventing its ability to infect.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is significant. Recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles within a gene locus. In this case, the two mutations (lytic vs. lysogenic) are located near each other on the T_4 chromosome. Recombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of offspring where the alleles are mixed. High RF indicates strong recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinants is:\n\nExpected recombinants = (Number of cross-over events / total possible recombinants)\n\nIn this context, the observed number of plasmids lost on each lawn can help determine the level of recombination. More plasmids lost would indicate more frequent recombination, meaning the mutations are closer together and the crossing over has increased.\n\nGiven that 40% of the phages infect strain B, indicating that the lysogenic mutation is present, and only 4% on strain K, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 8%, which is high enough to explain such differences in plasmid loss rates. However, none of the options provided go up to 8%. The highest option is H. 5 percent.\n\nWait, let me think again. The difference in plasmid loss between the two lyes is 36% (40-4=36). The percentage of plasmids lost in each case is 40% for B and 4% for K. The ratio of plasmid loss is 10 times higher in strain B. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is more likely to persist on strain B, while it's more common on strain K.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the likelihood of recombination given the plasmid loss rates. The number of plasmids lost is proportional to the probability of recombination. For example, if the recombination frequency is r, the expected plasmid loss rate for each parent is p(1 - r), where p is the original plasmid loss rate.\n\nAssuming that the original plasmid loss rate (without recombination) is 50% for both strains, the observed plasmid loss rates are 40% for B and 4% for K. The ratio of plasmid losses is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination frequency is r, the expected ratio would be (p)(1 - r)/(q)(1 - r) = p/q. Here, p is 0.4 and q is 0.04, so p/q = 10. Thus, assuming p = q, but here p \u2260 q. To achieve the observed ratio, the recombination frequency must be such that (1 - r) * p / [(1 - r) * q] = p/q. So the observed ratio matches the theoretical ratio under the assumption that the recombination frequency is applied uniformly across both strains.\n\nIf the original p and q are equal, then the observed ratio is 10:1. But since the original p and q aren't necessarily equal, we can solve for r using the equation:\n\n(p)(1 - r) = 10 * (q)(1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to p = 10q, but that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, considering that the ratio of plasmid loss is 10:1, the recombination frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination frequency is r. Then, the expected plasmid loss rates would be p(1 - r) and q(1 - r), where p and q are the original rates. If the original rates are the same, say both 50%, then the observed rates would be 50%(1 - r) and 50%(1 - r), giving the same ratio. However, in our case, the original rates are different: 40% and 4%.\n\nTo find r, we set up the equation:\n\n40% = 10 * 4%\n\nWhich implies that the recombination frequency r must be such that the observed plasmid loss on B is ten times that on K. This suggests that the recombination frequency is high, probably around 90%, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is simpler.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices are percentages, and the correct choice is F. 0.3 percent. Wait, no, according to the previous thought, the recombination frequency should be high. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. So, if R is the recombination frequency, then:\n\nFor strain B: 40 = (R) * 50 * (some factor)\nFor strain K: 4 = (R) * 4 * (same factor?)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. So, if the original plasmid loss rates are the same, then the observed ratio would be determined by the recombination frequency. But since the original rates are different, we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed Plasmid Loss on B - Observed Plasmid Loss on K) / (Observed Plasmid Loss on B + Observed Plasmid Loss on K)\n\nBut that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed Plasmid Loss on B - Observed Plasmid Loss on K) / (Observed Plasmid Loss on B + Observed Plasmid Loss on K)\n\nWait, that seems off. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of odds. The ratio of plasmid loss on B to K is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination frequency applies equally, the expected ratio would depend on the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rates.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as r, and the original plasmid loss rates as p_B = 40% and p_K = 4%. The observed plasmid loss rates would then be p_B*(1 - r) and p_K*(1 - r). The ratio of observed plasmid loss on B to K is:\n\n[40*(1 - r)] / [4*(1 - r)] = 10/1\n\nThis holds true regardless of r, which suggests that the data doesn't allow us to calculate r directly, as any value of r would satisfy the equation. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nPerhaps the correct method is to consider that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. Therefore:\n\nNumber lost on B = r * p_B\nNumber lost on K = r * p_K\n\nGiven that Number lost on B = 10 * Number lost on K,\n\nr * p_B = 10 * (r * p_K)\n\nDivide both sides by r:\n\np_B = 10 * p_K\n\nBut p_B is 40% and p_K is 4%, so 40 = 10 * 4 \u2192 40 = 40, which holds true. Therefore, any r satisfies the condition, which means we cannot determine r from the given information. Hence, we need to rely on additional reasoning.\n\nSince the observed plasmid loss on B is much higher than on K, the recombination frequency must be high. Looking at the options, the highest is H. 5 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation assumes that the recombination frequency is applied once, reducing the plasmid loss rate by that fraction.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 90%, then:\n\nPlasmid loss on B = 50% * (1 - 0.9) = 5%\nPlasmid loss on K = 5% * (1 - 0.9) = 0.5%\n\nBut the observed plasmid loss on B is 40%, which is much higher than 5%, so 90% is too high. Alternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is 80%, leading to:\n\nPlasmid loss on B = 50% * (1 - 0.8) = 10%\nPlasmid loss on K = 4% * (1 - 0.8) = 0.8%\n\nStill lower than observed plasmid loss on B. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of plasmid loss. Given that the plasmid loss on B is ten times that on K, the recombination frequency must be such that the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate on B equals ten times the product on K.\n\nThus:\n\nr * p_B = 10 * r * p_K\n\nBut this simplifies to p_B = 10 * p_K, which holds true. Therefore, we cannot determine r from this equation alone. We need another piece of information, perhaps the actual value of r based on experimental design.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the difference in plasmid loss rates. The difference is 36%, which is quite large. This suggests that the recombination frequency is very high. Among the options, H. 5% and G. 0.5% are relatively high frequencies. However, the exact calculation requires knowing whether the plasmid loss is a multiplicative effect or additive. \n\nIf the recombination frequency reduces the plasmid loss by a certain percentage, then the observed plasmid loss would be the product of the original loss and the reduction. For example, if the recombination frequency is r, then the plasmid loss would be reduced by r, making the observed loss (1 - r) times the original.\n\nTherefore, the observed plasmid loss on B is 40% of the original, and on K, it's 4%. Assuming the original was 50% on both, then:\n\nOn B: 50% * (1 - r) = 40% \u2192 1 - r = 0.8 \u2192 r = 0.2 or 20%\n\nOn K: 50% * (1 - r) = 4% \u2192 1 - r = 0.08 \u2192 r = 0.92 or 92%\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the original plasmid loss rates are not equal, which complicates matters. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the recombination frequency is such that the observed plasmid loss on B is significantly higher than on K, indicating a high recombination frequency.\n\nAmong the options, H. 5% and G. 0.5% are plausible. However, the data shows that the recombination frequency must account for the large difference in plasmid loss rates. If the recombination frequency is 5%, then:\n\nOn B: 50% * 0.95 = 47.5% plasmid loss (close to 40%)\n\nOn K: 5% * 0.95 = 4.75% plasmid loss (but observed is 4%), which is close. So 5% could fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination frequency is 0.5%, then:\n\nOn B: 50% * 0.995 = 49.75% (close to 40%)\n\nOn K: 5% * 0.995 = 4.975% (close to 4%).\n\nBoth seem plausible, but the observed data shows a larger difference, so perhaps the recombination frequency is higher, like 5% or 0.5%. However, looking at the options, 0.5% is included, but 5% is also an option.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Or perhaps it's linear. Without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to pin down. However, given that the observed plasmid loss on B is about ten times that on K, the recombination frequency must be such that the plasmid loss on B is reduced by ten times the factor compared to K. This suggests a very high recombination frequency, possibly around 5% or 0.5%.\n\nBut considering the options, F. 0.3% is also available, which is closer to 0.5% than 5%. However, my earlier calculation suggested that 0.5% fits better with the observed data. But the discrepancy arises because the observed plasmid loss rates are not consistent with a simple multiplication by the recombination frequency; instead, they reflect a more complex interplay.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, I'll make an educated guess based on the closest plausible option. Since 0.5% is an option (G), and 5% is also an option (H), but the data points towards a higher recombination frequency, I'll choose F. 0.3% as the most appropriate answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 on B mean 40 infections, and 4 on K mean 4 infections.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Each bacterium that gets infected will produce a phage. So if you have 40 plumes on B's lawn, that means 40 phages (infections) occurred on B. Similarly, 4 on K mean 4 phages on K's lawn. But why would we see more on B? Because maybe the phages from the other half (the 1:10^5 dilution) are more effective at infecting B than K?\n\nHmm, perhaps the presence of multiple phages affects the growth. Alternatively, maybe the presence of lysogenic phages allows them to infect both strains, while lysogenic ones cause lytic fission only on their own host. Since the lysogenic phage causes damage only on strain B, the presence of the other type might affect how well they grow, leading to more or fewer infections.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So the lysogenic phage should kill strain B, but the other mutation should just die without affecting strain K. Maybe the interaction between the two mutations leads to some kind of competition where they prevent each other from growing as effectively.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple phages could lead to some form of selection or interference, affecting the number of viable phages. If the lysogenic phage is able to replicate without causing lytic fission, then it might survive better and infect more bacteria, but in reality, lysogenic phages do cause lytic fission, so they die after replication.\n\nWait, but the initial test showed that lysogenic phages cause lytic fission only on strain B. So in the first experiment, the lysogenic phage kills strain B, leaving only strain K intact. However, when both mutants are present, strain B is partially lysed, meaning only part of the phages are killing it, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is somehow surviving and infecting some cells, while others don't get killed. That could happen due to the presence of the other mutation, the lysogenic one, which doesn't cause death but may interfere with growth.\n\nSo, perhaps the lysogenic phage (mutant A) can replicate without causing lytic fission, thus allowing it to infect some cells even when the lysogenic phage (mutant B) is present. This would result in some of the lysogenic phage being active despite the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, the number of phages that can infect strain B is higher when both mutants are present, leading to more plasmid loss and less of a clear area on the lawn.\n\nIn the experiment, the majority of the phages on strain B's lawn (40 plumes) indicate that the lysogenic mutation is still present because it can infect some cells. On the other hand, the few plumes on strain K (4) suggest that the lysogenic mutation isn't as effective in preventing infection on strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect strain K, or that there's some mutation preventing its ability to infect.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is significant. Recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles within a gene locus. In this case, the two mutations (lytic vs. lysogenic) are located near each other on the T_4 chromosome. Recombination frequency (RF) measures the proportion of offspring where the alleles are mixed. High RF indicates strong recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinants is:\n\nExpected recombinants = (Number of cross-over events / total possible recombinants)\n\nIn this context, the observed number of plasmids lost on each lawn can help determine the level of recombination. More plasmids lost would indicate more frequent recombination, meaning the mutations are closer together and the crossing over has increased.\n\nGiven that 40% of the phages infect strain B, indicating that the lysogenic mutation is present, and only 4% on strain K, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 8%, which is high enough to explain such differences in plasmid loss rates. However, none of the options provided go up to 8%. The highest option is H. 5 percent.\n\nWait, let me think again. The difference in plasmid loss between the two lyes is 36% (40-4=36). The percentage of plasmids lost in each case is 40% for B and 4% for K. The ratio of plasmid loss is 10 times higher in strain B. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation is more likely to persist on strain B, while it's more common on strain K.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the likelihood of recombination given the plasmid loss rates. The number of plasmids lost is proportional to the probability of recombination. For example, if the recombination frequency is r, the expected plasmid loss rate for each parent is p(1 - r), where p is the original plasmid loss rate.\n\nAssuming that the original plasmid loss rate (without recombination) is 50% for both strains, the observed plasmid loss rates are 40% for B and 4% for K. The ratio of plasmid losses is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination frequency is r, the expected ratio would be (p)(1 - r)/(q)(1 - r) = p/q. Here, p is 0.4 and q is 0.04, so p/q = 10. Thus, assuming p = q, but here p \u2260 q. To achieve the observed ratio, the recombination frequency must be such that (1 - r) * p / [(1 - r) * q] = p/q. So the observed ratio matches the theoretical ratio under the assumption that the recombination frequency is applied uniformly across both strains.\n\nIf the original p and q are equal, then the observed ratio is 10:1. But since the original p and q aren't necessarily equal, we can solve for r using the equation:\n\n(p)(1 - r) = 10 * (q)(1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to p = 10q, but that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, considering that the ratio of plasmid loss is 10:1, the recombination frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the recombination frequency is r. Then, the expected plasmid loss rates would be p(1 - r) and q(1 - r), where p and q are the original rates. If the original rates are the same, say both 50%, then the observed rates would be 50%(1 - r) and 50%(1 - r), giving the same ratio. However, in our case, the original rates are different: 40% and 4%.\n\nTo find r, we set up the equation:\n\n40% = 10 * 4%\n\nWhich implies that the recombination frequency r must be such that the observed plasmid loss on B is ten times that on K. This suggests that the recombination frequency is high, probably around 90%, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is simpler.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices are percentages, and the correct choice is F. 0.3 percent. Wait, no, according to the previous thought, the recombination frequency should be high. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. So, if R is the recombination frequency, then:\n\nFor strain B: 40 = (R) * 50 * (some factor)\nFor strain K: 4 = (R) * 4 * (same factor?)\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. So, if the original plasmid loss rates are the same, then the observed ratio would be determined by the recombination frequency. But since the original rates are different, we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed Plasmid Loss on B - Observed Plasmid Loss on K) / (Observed Plasmid Loss on B + Observed Plasmid Loss on K)\n\nBut that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed Plasmid Loss on B - Observed Plasmid Loss on K) / (Observed Plasmid Loss on B + Observed Plasmid Loss on K)\n\nWait, that seems off. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of odds. The ratio of plasmid loss on B to K is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination frequency applies equally, the expected ratio would depend on the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rates.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as r, and the original plasmid loss rates as p_B = 40% and p_K = 4%. The observed plasmid loss rates would then be p_B*(1 - r) and p_K*(1 - r). The ratio of observed plasmid loss on B to K is:\n\n[40*(1 - r)] / [4*(1 - r)] = 10/1\n\nThis holds true regardless of r, which suggests that the data doesn't allow us to calculate r directly, as any value of r would satisfy the equation. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nPerhaps the correct method is to consider that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate. Therefore:\n\nNumber lost on B = r * p_B\nNumber lost on K = r * p_K\n\nGiven that Number lost on B = 10 * Number lost on K,\n\nr * p_B = 10 * (r * p_K)\n\nDivide both sides by r:\n\np_B = 10 * p_K\n\nBut p_B is 40% and p_K is 4%, so 40 = 10 * 4 \u2192 40 = 40, which holds true. Therefore, any r satisfies the condition, which means we cannot determine r from the given information. Hence, we need to rely on additional reasoning.\n\nSince the observed plasmid loss on B is much higher than on K, the recombination frequency must be high. Looking at the options, the highest is H. 5 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation assumes that the recombination frequency is applied once, reducing the plasmid loss rate by that fraction.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 90%, then:\n\nPlasmid loss on B = 50% * (1 - 0.9) = 5%\nPlasmid loss on K = 5% * (1 - 0.9) = 0.5%\n\nBut the observed plasmid loss on B is 40%, which is much higher than 5%, so 90% is too high. Alternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is 80%, leading to:\n\nPlasmid loss on B = 50% * (1 - 0.8) = 10%\nPlasmid loss on K = 4% * (1 - 0.8) = 0.8%\n\nStill lower than observed plasmid loss on B. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of plasmid loss. Given that the plasmid loss on B is ten times that on K, the recombination frequency must be such that the product of the recombination frequency and the original plasmid loss rate on B equals ten times the product on K.\n\nThus:\n\nr * p_B = 10 * r * p_K\n\nBut this simplifies to p_B = 10 * p_K, which holds true. Therefore, we cannot determine r from this equation alone.

However, if they recombine, their occurrence might be less independent. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of interference, leading to fewer infections. This suggests that the mutations interact somehow. If they recombine, maybe they influence each other's activity, affecting the probability of infection. \n\nLet me think about the expected numbers without recombination. Normally, if both mutations occur independently, each mutation would contribute to the overall risk. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 1% chance and the lytic phage has a 1% chance, the combined effect might be additive or multiplicative depending on how they work. But in reality, since phages don't typically work in such ways, perhaps the combined effect isn't straightforward. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the dilution factors. The first half was plated at 1:10^7, which is a high dilution, meaning fewer phages are present to infect. The second half was at 1:10^5, which is lower dilution. Since both mutations affect the outcome, higher dilution might mean less likely events. \n\nBut the number of plumes (infections) on each lawn depends on the frequency of successful infections. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. Let's denote p as the frequency of each mutation. Then the probability of both mutations being present is p^2. \n\nIf I assume that the number of plumes observed corresponds to the square of the frequency, then 4 plumes on K could correspond to p^2 = 4/total_plaques. Similarly, 40 on B would be another calculation. Wait, no\u2014each half is treated separately. So for the B lawn, 40 plumes indicate p^2 = 40/(total_plaques), and for the K lawn, 4 plumes indicate p^2 = 4/(total_plaques). \n\nBut wait, total_plaques would be the sum of both halves. The B half had 40 plumes, and the K half had 4, making a total of 44 plumes across both plates? Or is it per plate? Hmm, the way it's worded is a bit unclear. It says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So each half is treated separately, meaning the total number of plumes is 4 + 40 = 44. \n\nSo, if we model each mutation's frequency as p, then the expected number of plumes would be 4 * (p)^2 for the B lawn and 40 * (q)^2 for the K lawn, where q is the frequency in the K half. But wait, actually, each half is treated separately, so the frequencies might be different. Alternatively, maybe the total plumes are the same for both, so the ratios can help us find p.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the B lawn had 4 plumes and the K half had 40, assuming that the number of plumes reflects the frequency squared multiplied by the area or concentration. But since the areas are the same, the ratio of plumes would equal the ratio of frequencies squared. So, 4 / 40 = (p)^2 / (q)^2. Simplifying, 1/10 = (p/q)^2 \u2192 p/q = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316. That means p \u2248 0.316 q. \n\nBut what do p and q represent? p is the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation, and q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage is carrying a mutation in rII, and the lytic phage doesn't have that mutation. So the lysogenic phage carries a mutation, and the lytic phage doesn't. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage mutation affects the outcome, while the lytic phage mutation doesn't. \n\nWhen both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active (since it carries the mutation), so it doesn't cause lysis. Hence, the combination leads to fewer infections than either mutation alone. This suggests that the two mutations are interacting, possibly recombining. \n\nRecombination would mean that the two mutations occur in the same phage copy number or in close proximity, influencing each other's activity. In that case, the combined effect would be less than the product of their individual effects. \n\nGiven that, if we let p be the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation, and q be the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, but since the lytic phage doesn't have the mutation, q=0? Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation occurs in the lysogenic phage, and the lytic phage doesn't have it. So the lytic phage is unaffected by the mutation. \n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage is the one that carries the mutation in rII, and the lytic phage doesn't have that mutation. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage is active (carries the mutation), hence causing non-lysis. \n\nNow, the number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully infected. So if both mutations happened in the same phage copy number, you get more interactions. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is carrying a mutation, and the lytic phage isn't. So perhaps the lysogenic phage has its own mutation, and the lytic phage doesn't. \n\nHmm, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage mutation reduces the risk of lysis, thus increasing the chances of infection. But when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active, so the lytic phage doesn't cause lysis. \n\nBut in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage mutation is dominant enough to cause lysis despite the lytic phage being present. \n\nTo determine the recombination rate, we can use the formula for interference, which relates to the number of doublets (double mutations) observed compared to the expected if mutations were independent. Interference decreases as the distance between mutations increases. \n\nInterference is calculated as:\n\nInterference = (Observed doublets) / (Expected doublets)\n\nWhere Expected doublets = (number of possible doublets) \u00d7 (probability of both mutations).\n\nHere, the number of possible doublets would depend on the allele frequencies. Assuming that the two mutations are linked and separated by a distance d, the expected number of doublets is (f1 \u00d7 f2) \u00d7 (1 - interference factor).\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed outcomes. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage mutation (let's call it M) occurs in some fraction of the phages, and the lytic phage mutation (L) doesn't occur, the presence of M reduces the chance of lysis. \n\nThe number of plumes on strain B is influenced by both mutations. On strain K, only the lysogenic phage mutation is present, so it shouldn't be affected much. \n\nFrom the data:\n- Strain B (with lysogenic and possibly recombined phages): 40 plumes.\n- Strain K (only lysogenic phage): 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active, reducing the number of successful infections. So the presence of both mutations leads to fewer infections than just the lysogenic phage. \n\nThe number of plumes (successful infections) on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. \n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the frequency of the mutation (since it's a binomial distribution), we can write:\n\nFor strain B: (p)^2 = 40 / N\n\nFor strain K: (q)^2 = 4 / N\n\nBut wait, both strains receive the same total number of plumes, N. So if strain K has 4 plumes, and strain B has 40, then 4 / 40 = (q/p)^2 \u2192 q/p = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316.\n\nThis implies that the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation (p) is approximately 3.16 times higher than the frequency of the lytic phage mutation (q). \n\nHowever, since the lytic phage doesn't have the mutation, q is zero, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, which is absent, so q=0. But that contradicts our earlier equation. Perhaps I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations reduces the effective frequency of the lysogenic phage. So the effective frequency of the lysogenic phage is p', where p' = p \u00d7 q. Because the lytic phage doesn't carry the mutation, q=0? No, that's not correct. Wait, the lysogenic phage carries the mutation, and the lytic phage doesn't. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage is active. \n\nTherefore, the effective frequency of the lysogenic phage is still p, but since it's active, the probability of successful infection is reduced. \n\nThus, the expected number of successful infections (plumes) would be proportional to p\u00b2. But in our case, the number of plumes is inversely related to p\u00b2. Wait, no\u2014the number of plumes is the actual count, so if p is higher, fewer plumes. \n\nSo from the data:\n\nStrain B: 40 plumes \u2192 p\u00b2 = 40/N\n\nStrain K: 4 plumes \u2192 q\u00b2 = 4/N\n\nTaking the ratio: (q\u00b2)/(p\u00b2) = (4/N)/(40/N) = 1/10 \u2192 (q/p)\u00b2 = 1/10 \u2192 q/p = 1/sqrt(10) \u2248 0.316\n\nSo q = 0.316 p\n\nBut q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, which doesn't exist. Wait, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I got it backwards. \n\nPerhaps the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation (p) is the same as the frequency of the lytic phage mutation (q), but since the lytic phage doesn't have the mutation, q=0, which again complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is determined by the difference in the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1, implying that the presence of both mutations reduces the successful infection rate by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the probability of successful infection is proportional to (p \u00d7 q), but q=0, this doesn't hold. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations reduces the probability by a factor due to interference. \n\nAnother approach: Calculate the expected number of doublets (both mutations) under independence and compare it to the observed. If recombination occurs, the observed number will be less than expected. \n\nUnder independence, the expected number of doublets would be (f1 \u00d7 f2) \u00d7 (1 - interference). But without knowing interference, perhaps we can estimate it using the plume counts.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the recombination rate can be estimated from the interference. \n\nInterference (I) = observed doublets / expected doublets\n\nAssuming that recombination is happening, the observed number of doublets (both mutations) would be less than expected under independence.\n\nBut in the absence of specific data on doublets, maybe we can proceed differently. \n\nConsidering that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active, so the number of successful infections is reduced. The exact relationship might require more detailed analysis, but perhaps we can approximate.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain B is 40 and on strain K is 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful infections by a factor of 10. \n\nIf we assume that the probability of successful infection is proportional to (p \u00d7 q), but q=0, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the presence of both mutations reduces the probability by a factor related to their recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination rate R is the proportion of doublets. If recombination occurs, the doublets are less frequent than expected under independence. \n\nIf R = 0, there's no recombination. If R > 0, doublets are less common. \n\nBut without knowing the exact number of doublets, perhaps we can infer based on the plume counts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key lies in the fact that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active, causing fewer infections. The difference in plume counts gives a clue about the number of doublets. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation (M) and the lytic phage doesn't (L), then when both are present, the lysogenic phage is active, reducing the infection rate. The number of successful infections is proportional to the frequency of M minus the interference caused by L.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination rate R can be approximated by the ratio of plumes. Since strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, and if the plumes are proportional to the square of the mutation frequencies, then:\n\nFor strain B: (p)^2 = 40/N\n\nFor strain K: (q)^2 = 4/N\n\nTaking the ratio: (q/p)^2 = 4/40 = 1/10 \u2192 q/p = 1/sqrt(10) \u2248 0.316\n\nBut since q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, which doesn't exist (as it doesn't carry the mutation), this seems contradictory. \n\nMaybe instead, the presence of both mutations reduces the probability of successful infection by a factor equal to the recombination rate. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the probability of successful infection is P = p \u00d7 (1 - R), assuming that the mutation in the lysogenic phage and the mutation in the lytic phage interfere with each other. \n\nThen, the number of plumes would be proportional to P. So:\n\nPlume_B = k \u00d7 p \u00d7 (1 - R)\n\nPlume_K = k \u00d7 q \u00d7 (1 - R)\n\nBut since q is negligible (or zero), this approach may not work. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to p \u00d7 q \u00d7 (1 - R), but again, q is zero. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler method. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is likely a small percentage, like 1%, given the significant reduction in plumes when both mutations are present. \n\nLooking back at the options, A through F are percentages, and G through J are smaller fractions. Since the recombination is likely low, the most plausible answer is D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). \n\nBetween these, 0.1% is closer to 0.2%. \n\nWait, but the exact calculation might give a more precise value. Let me try again.\n\nAssume that the recombination rate R determines how much the mutations interact. If R is the probability that the two mutations happen together, then the expected number of doublets (both mutations) would be (f1 \u00d7 f2) \u00d7 (1 - R), assuming independence otherwise.\n\nBut we have the number of plumes, which might relate to the expected number of doublets. However, without knowing the exact values of f1 and f2, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, if we take the ratio of plumes, 40:4, simplifies to 10:1, suggesting that the presence of both mutations reduces the success by a factor of 10. If this reduction is due to recombination, then the recombination rate R would be such that 1 - R = 1/10 \u2192 R = 9/10 = 0.9. But this doesn't align with the options provided. \n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up the roles. If R is the fraction of doublets, then R = (observed doublets)/expected. But if observed doublets are zero (assuming no recombination), then R=0. But in our case, there are doublets (e.g., both mutations present in the same phage), so R must be greater than zero. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to compute R accurately. Given the options, the smallest plausible percentage is 0.1%, option D. \n\nI think I'll go with D.0.1%\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 4 on K mean 4 phages caused a problem, and 40 on B mean more problems. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here refers to how often the mutations occurred together during the phage infection process. If two mutations occurred independently, we'd expect certain probabilities. However, if they recombine, their occurrence might be less independent. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of interference, leading to fewer infections. This suggests that the mutations interact somehow. If they recombine, maybe they influence each other's activity, affecting the probability of infection. \n\nLet me think about the expected numbers without recombination. Normally, if both mutations occur independently, each mutation would contribute to the overall risk. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 1% chance and the lytic phage has a 1% chance, the combined effect might be additive or multiplicative depending on how they work. But in reality, since phages don't typically work in such ways, perhaps the combined effect isn't straightforward. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the dilution factors. The first half was plated at 1:10^7, which is a high dilution, meaning fewer phages are present to infect. The second half was at 1:10^5, which is lower dilution. Since both mutations affect the outcome, higher dilution might mean less likely events. \n\nBut the number of plumes (infections) on each lawn depends on the frequency of successful infections. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. Let's denote p as the frequency of each mutation. Then the probability of both mutations being present is p^2. \n\nIf I assume that the number of plumes observed corresponds to the square of the frequency, then 4 plumes on K could correspond to p^2 = 4/total_plaques. Similarly, 40 on B would be another calculation. Wait, no\u2014each half is treated separately. So for the B lawn, 40 plumes indicate p^2 = 40/(total_plaques), and for the K lawn, 4 plumes indicate p^2 = 4/(total_plaques). \n\nBut wait, total_plaques would be the sum of both halves. The B half had 40 plumes, and the K half had 4, making a total of 44 plumes across both plates? Or is it per plate? Hmm, the way it's worded is a bit unclear. It says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So each half is treated separately, meaning the total number of plumes is 4 + 40 = 44. \n\nSo, if we model each mutation's frequency as p, then the expected number of plumes would be 4 * (p)^2 for the B lawn and 40 * (q)^2 for the K lawn, where q is the frequency in the K half. But wait, actually, each half is treated separately, so the frequencies might be different. Alternatively, maybe the total plumes are the same for both, so the ratios can help us find p.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the B lawn had 4 plumes and the K half had 40, assuming that the number of plumes reflects the frequency squared multiplied by the area or concentration. But since the areas are the same, the ratio of plumes would equal the ratio of frequencies squared. So, 4 / 40 = (p)^2 / (q)^2. Simplifying, 1/10 = (p/q)^2 \u2192 p/q = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316. That means p \u2248 0.316 q. \n\nBut what do p and q represent? p is the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation, and q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage is carrying a mutation in rII, and the lytic phage doesn't have that mutation. So the lysogenic phage carries a mutation, and the lytic phage doesn't. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage mutation affects the outcome, while the lytic phage mutation doesn't. \n\nWhen both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active (since it carries the mutation), so it doesn't cause lysis. Hence, the combination leads to fewer infections than either mutation alone.

On strain K, only the lysogenic phage mutation is present, so it shouldn't be affected much. \n\nFrom the data:\n- Strain B (with lysogenic and possibly recombined phages): 40 plumes.\n- Strain K (only lysogenic phage): 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is active, reducing the number of successful infections.

So if strain K has 4 plumes, and strain B has 40, then 4 / 40 = (q/p)^2 \u2192 q/p = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316.\n\nThis implies that the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation (p) is approximately 3.16 times higher than the frequency of the lytic phage mutation (q). \n\nHowever, since the lytic phage doesn't have the mutation, q is zero, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, which is absent, so q=0. But that contradicts our earlier equation.

The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1, implying that the presence of both mutations reduces the successful infection rate by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the probability of successful infection is proportional to (p \u00d7 q), but q=0, this doesn't hold.

The number of successful infections is proportional to the frequency of M minus the interference caused by L.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination rate R can be approximated by the ratio of plumes. Since strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, and if the plumes are proportional to the square of the mutation frequencies, then:\n\nFor strain B: (p)^2 = 40/N\n\nFor strain K: (q)^2 = 4/N\n\nTaking the ratio: (q/p)^2 = 4/40 = 1/10 \u2192 q/p = 1/sqrt(10) \u2248 0.316\n\nBut since q is the frequency of the lytic phage mutation, which doesn't exist (as it doesn't carry the mutation), this seems contradictory. \n\nMaybe instead, the presence of both mutations reduces the probability of successful infection by a factor equal to the recombination rate. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the probability of successful infection is P = p \u00d7 (1 - R), assuming that the mutation in the lysogenic phage and the mutation in the lytic phage interfere with each other. \n\nThen, the number of plumes would be proportional to P. So:\n\nPlume_B = k \u00d7 p \u00d7 (1 - R)\n\nPlume_K = k \u00d7 q \u00d7 (1 - R)\n\nBut since q is negligible (or zero), this approach may not work. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to p \u00d7 q \u00d7 (1 - R), but again, q is zero. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler method. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is likely a small percentage, like 1%, given the significant reduction in plumes when both mutations are present. \n\nLooking back at the options, A through F are percentages, and G through J are smaller fractions. Since the recombination is likely low, the most plausible answer is D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). \n\nBetween these, 0.1% is closer to 0.2%. \n\nWait, but the exact calculation might give a more precise value. Let me try again.\n\nAssume that the recombination rate R determines how much the mutations interact. If R is the probability that the two mutations happen together, then the expected number of doublets (both mutations) would be (f1 \u00d7 f2) \u00d7 (1 - R), assuming independence otherwise.\n\nBut we have the number of plumes, which might relate to the expected number of doublets. However, without knowing the exact values of f1 and f2, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, if we take the ratio of plumes, 40:4, simplifies to 10:1, suggesting that the presence of both mutations reduces the success by a factor of 10. If this reduction is due to recombination, then the recombination rate R would be such that 1 - R = 1/10 \u2192 R = 9/10 = 0.9. But this doesn't align with the options provided. \n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up the roles. If R is the fraction of doublets, then R = (observed doublets)/expected. But if observed doublets are zero (assuming no recombination), then R=0. But in our case, there are doublets (e.g., both mutations present in the same phage), so R must be greater than zero. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to compute R accurately. Given the options, the smallest plausible percentage is 0.1%, option D. \n\nI think I'll go with D.0.1%\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it would be more likely to cause issues when replicating.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), most of the phages don't replicate well, so the lysogenic phage might survive and lyse, causing the E. coli to die. Conversely, the lytic phage doesn't replicate as effectively, so maybe it dies too. But why does the second dilution matter? Because if they do recombine, then the number of plasmids transferred would change, affecting the probability of replication and thus death or lysis.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\n rf = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're looking at the distribution of plasmids. Each plasmid represents a copy of the phage DNA. If the phages undergo recombination, their replication may lead to different numbers of plasmids being passed on to daughter cells.\n\nWhen the two mutantphages are mixed together, some cells might combine their DNA copies, leading to recombinant phages. This affects the probability of replication and the likelihood of lytic or lysogenic outcomes.\n\nGiven that the first dilution (1:10^7) shows almost all plasmids (40/48 \u2248 83%) surviving and dying, suggesting that the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) survives and reproduces, indicating no recombination occurs quickly.

But if there's recombination, perhaps some of its plasmids end up on the same chromosome as the other phage. So when the lysogenic phage is diluted in such a way that it doesn't replicate much, it might still lyse because it can't replicate properly without the other phage providing a template.\n\nSo the first dilution (1:10^7) means that the lysogenic phage hasn't had enough chance to replicate yet, so it might still replicate and lyse, explaining why most cells die. The second dilution (1:10^5) means that the lysogenic phage has had more time to replicate and recombine, so it doesn't lyse as much because it now has a larger number of plasmids, making replication harder, and hence fewer phages survive.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, I think the formula is based on the ratio of plasmids. If r is the recombination rate per replication, then the probability that a plasmid from one phage combines with another is r. So the expected number of recombinant offspring would depend on this.\n\nIn the first experiment, when the phage concentration is high (1:10^7), the recombination hasn't occurred yet, so the lysogenic phage must replicate and lyse, leading to a high number of dead cells. In the second experiment, lower phage concentration allows more recombination, so the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate as efficiently, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nThe actual calculation uses the formula:\n\n rf = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies - number of recombinant colonies)\n\nBut given that the problem states 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, I'm a bit confused about what exactly counts as recombinant.

    "rollout": " So 4 plumes indicate 4 successful infections. \n\nNow, let's think about how phage interactions work. If two mutants interact, their recombinant phages would be less effective than either wild type alone. In this case, the presence of both mutant types leads to more efficient infection because the phages can form a double mutant that combines the effects of both. But wait, in the experiment, only strain B was affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues here, maybe because it wasn't interacting well. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, if both mutants can coexist and produce double mutants, then the efficiency might be higher than expected from individual plasmids.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify. The problem states that both mutant types are present. The first half is dilute enough to have fewer events, and the second half has a higher dilution, leading to more plumes. This could indicate that the second half has a higher efficiency because it's being plated on a different strain. Since the result shows more plumes on K, it suggests that the phages from the first half are more active when plated on strain B. That makes sense because the double mutant phage would have lower activity compared to the individual mutants, so more plumes when plated on strain B. Conversely, when plated on strain K, which may have a different mutation profile, fewer plumes suggest that the phages from the first half don't cause as much damage when plated on strain K.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. If two mutants undergo recombination, they form a double mutant phage that has a lower fitness than either individual. In terms of plating efficiency, a double mutant should show lower pluming intensity than either parent. However, in this case, both types are present, and the higher-diluted sample (plated on strain K) shows fewer plumes, which aligns with the idea that the double mutant isn't as effective as the individual mutants, especially when the phage is under selective pressure (since it's on a strain).\n\nThe number of plumes relates to the frequency of successful infections. Each plume represents an event where the phage successfully infects a bacterium. The count of plumes depends on factors like the concentration of phages, the host's susceptibility, and the presence of any resistance mechanisms. In this case, the higher-diluted sample (plated on strain K) has fewer plumes, which implies that the phages from the first half aren't as effective when plated on strain K. This could mean that the phages from the first half have a certain degree of recombination with the original phage, making them less effective when plated on a different strain. The more recombination, the lower the efficiency because the phage components are mixed, reducing their effectiveness.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula for the probability of recombination (r) given the observed outcomes. The formula is:\n\nr = (p + q - pq) / p\n\nWhere p is the proportion of one mutant, q is the proportion of another, and pq is their product. However, since we're dealing with plume counts, which are proportional to the number of successful infections, we can use the ratio of plumes to determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIn the first half, when plated on strain B, there are 40 plumes. In the second half, when plated on strain K, there are 4 plumes. Assuming that the number of phages and the initial concentrations are similar, the difference in plume counts indicates the effect of recombination. The more recombination, the fewer plumes because the phages mix and reduce their effectiveness.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- r = recombination fraction (the fraction of the parental sequence preserved)\n- P = probability of a plume coming from the parental phage\n- Q = probability of a plume coming from the non-parental phage\n\nIf there is complete recombination, r=1, and all plumes come from the parentals. If there's no recombination, r=0, and all plumes are non-recombinant.\n\nGiven the data:\n- First sample (strain B): 40 plumes\n- Second sample (strain K): 4 plumes\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the second sample would have similar plume counts as the first, but with recombination, the second sample would have fewer. To find the recombination rate, we can compare the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of plumes after recombination:\n\nN = N0 * e^{-r}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Another approach is to consider the ratio of plumes between the two samples. Since the phages have undergone recombination, the ratio of plumes should reflect the level of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the total number of phages in each sample is the same. Then, the ratio of plumes (K to B) is 4/40 = 1/10. This means that the second sample is 10 times less likely to produce plumes than the first. If there was no recombination, the ratio would remain the same. With recombination, the ratio decreases because the phages are mixed.\n\nThe decrease in plume count due to recombination can be modeled using the formula:\n\nln(r) = ln(N_B / N_K)\n\nBut I might be getting ahead of myself. Let's try another angle. The number of plumes is related to the probability of each phage surviving. If there's recombination, the survival probabilities change.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the first sample (strain B) would have a certain number of plumes, and the second sample (strain K) would have a similar number due to the same phage pool. But with recombination, the second sample has fewer plumes, indicating that the phages are more likely to be non-recombinant.\n\nThe key is to estimate the recombination fraction (r) such that the observed plume ratio reflects the expected outcome. Given that the second sample has 10 times fewer plumes than the first, this suggests that the recombination rate is high.\n\nUsing the formula for the number of plumes after recombination:\n\nP = (1 - r) * p + r * sqrt(p(1-p))\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach. Instead, let's think about the likelihood of recombination needed to explain the observation.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is r, then the probability of observing the given plume distribution is highest at a particular value of r. We can set up equations based on the observed plume numbers and solve for r.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, which is 40:4 or 10:1. This suggests that the second sample is ten times more likely to lose plumes due to recombination. The probability of losing plumes due to recombination can be expressed as r, so the observed ratio is influenced by r.\n\nThe formula for the expected plume count after recombination is:\n\nN_expected = N0 * e^{-r}\n\nBut since the actual plume count is N0*(1 - r), assuming that each plume has a probability r of being lost due to recombination. Therefore, the ratio of plumes would be approximately 1/(1 - r).\n\nGiven that the observed ratio is 4/40 = 1/10, we can set up:\n\n1/(1 - r) \u2248 1/10\n\nSolving for r gives:\n\n1 - r \u2248 10\n\nWhich would imply r \u2248 -9, which doesn't make sense because r cannot be negative. Therefore, my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. So, if the recombination rate is r, the plume count scales with 1/sqrt(r).\n\nGiven that the plume count ratio is 40:4 = 10:1, we can write:\n\nsqrt(r) = sqrt(40/4) = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16\n\nTherefore, r \u2248 (1/3.16)^2 \u2248 0.102.\n\nSo, the recombination fraction r is approximately 0.102, meaning about 10% of the time the phages are recombined.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest answer is F. 0.3 percent, but our calculation is around 10%, which is much higher. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check again. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of survivors. If recombination occurs frequently, more plumes will survive because the mixture reduces the chance of loss. Therefore, a lower recombination rate would lead to more plumes surviving.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, r \u2248 0.102, which is about 10%. None of the options match exactly. The closest is H. 5 percent, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let's reconsider. The number of plumes is proportional to the survival probability. If the recombination rate is r, then the survival probability per plume is (1 - r). So, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - r).\n\nGiven that the observed plume ratio is 40:4 = 10:1, the survival probability per plume in the second sample is 1/10th of the first sample. Therefore:\n\n(1 - r) = 1/10\n\nThus, r = 1 - 1/10 = 0.9\n\nThat's 90% recombination, which is way too high. Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. So:\n\nsqrt(r) = sqrt(40/4) = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16\n\nThen, r \u2248 (3.16)^2 \u2248 10.\n\nAgain, this leads to r \u2248 10, which is even higher than before. It seems I'm consistently getting r\u224810%, but none of the options match. Perhaps I misunderstood the relationship.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is that the plume count after recombination is proportional to (1 - r), so:\n\nN_K = N_B * (1 - r)\n\nGiven that N_K/N_B = 4/40 = 1/10, so:\n\n1 - r = 1/10 => r = 0.9\n\nThis suggests 90% recombination, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes relates to the square of the recombination rate. For instance, the probability of having a double mutant is r^2, so the plume count could be proportional to r^2. But in that case, with r^2 = 1/10, r would be ~0.316, which is about 31.6%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the highest is J. 0.05 percent, and the lowest is G. 0.5 percent. My calculation suggests 90%, which is far beyond any option. This discrepancy suggests I made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nLet me rethink the experimental design. When the two types of phage are present, the first sample (strain B) has 40 plumes, and the second sample (strain K) has 4. This suggests that the second sample is more susceptible, implying that the phages from the first sample are more active when plated on strain K. Recombination would affect the activity of the phages when they are exposed to different strains, potentially increasing the chance of loss of plumes when plated on a different strain.\n\nRecombination affects the ability of the phages to replicate within the bacterial genome, thereby affecting their survival upon subsequent plating. If recombination occurs, the phages may not efficiently integrate into the bacterial genome, reducing their replication and thus decreasing their plume count.\n\nThe observed increase in plumes on strain K (from 40 to 4) suggests that the phages from the first sample are less effective when plated on strain K. The exact recombination rate can be estimated by comparing the plume counts between the two samples.\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 1/10. Assuming that recombination affects the survival of the phages, the survival probability in the second sample is (1 - r). Therefore:\n\n(1 - r) = (number of plumes in first sample) / (number of plumes in second sample) = 40 / 4 = 10\n\nThus, r = 1 - 10 = -9\n\nThis is impossible, so clearly, the assumption is incorrect. Instead, the survival probability should be proportional to the inverse of the plume count. So, the survival probability in the second sample is 4/40 = 1/10, meaning that 1/10 of the phages survived better in strain B than in strain K.\n\nThus, the recombination rate r satisfies:\n\n1 - r = 1/10 => r = 1 - 1/10 = 0.9\n\nAgain, this leads to r \u2248 90%, which is not among the options. This inconsistency suggests that the experimental design or assumptions might be incorrect, but based on the given options, I'll proceed to choose the closest plausible answer.\n\nGiven the options, H. 5 percent and G. 0.5 percent are the closest, but neither matches 90%. Perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the difference in plume counts and express it as a percentage of the total. For example, (40 - 4)/40 = 96%, which is very high, but that doesn't directly translate to recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of recombination reduces the efficiency of the phages, the recombination fraction r can be estimated by the ratio of plume counts. Since the second sample has fewer plumes, the recombination rate is high.\n\nGiven the available options, the most reasonable choice is C. 1.5 percent, assuming that the correct calculation yields a lower recombination rate. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to select accurately.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is C. 1.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 4 plumes indicate 4 successful infections. \n\nNow, let's think about how phage interactions work. If two mutants interact, their recombinant phages would be less effective than either wild type alone. In this case, the presence of both mutant types leads to more efficient infection because the phages can form a double mutant that combines the effects of both. But wait, in the experiment, only strain B was affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues here, maybe because it wasn't interacting well. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, if both mutants can coexist and produce double mutants, then the efficiency might be higher than expected from individual plasmids.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify. The problem states that both mutant types are present. The first half is dilute enough to have fewer events, and the second half has a higher dilution, leading to more plumes. This could indicate that the second half has a higher efficiency because it's being plated on a different strain. Since the result shows more plumes on K, it suggests that the phages from the first half are more active when plated on strain B. That makes sense because the double mutant phage would have lower activity compared to the individual mutants, so more plumes when plated on strain B. Conversely, when plated on strain K, which may have a different mutation profile, fewer plumes suggest that the phages from the first half don't cause as much damage when plated on strain K.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. If two mutants undergo recombination, they form a double mutant phage that has a lower fitness than either individual. In terms of plating efficiency, a double mutant should show lower pluming intensity than either parent. However, in this case, both types are present, and the higher-diluted sample (plated on strain K) shows fewer plumes, which aligns with the idea that the double mutant isn't as effective as the individual mutants, especially when the phage is under selective pressure (since it's on a strain).\n\nThe number of plumes relates to the frequency of successful infections. Each plume represents an event where the phage successfully infects a bacterium. The count of plumes depends on factors like the concentration of phages, the host's susceptibility, and the presence of any resistance mechanisms. In this case, the higher-diluted sample (plated on strain K) has fewer plumes, which implies that the phages from the first half aren't as effective when plated on strain K. This could mean that the phages from the first half have a certain degree of recombination with the original phage, making them less effective when plated on a different strain. The more recombination, the lower the efficiency because the phage components are mixed, reducing their effectiveness.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula for the probability of recombination (r) given the observed outcomes. The formula is:\n\nr = (p + q - pq) / p\n\nWhere p is the proportion of one mutant, q is the proportion of another, and pq is their product. However, since we're dealing with plume counts, which are proportional to the number of successful infections, we can use the ratio of plumes to determine the likelihood of recombination.\n\nIn the first half, when plated on strain B, there are 40 plumes. In the second half, when plated on strain K, there are 4 plumes. Assuming that the number of phages and the initial concentrations are similar, the difference in plume counts indicates the effect of recombination. The more recombination, the fewer plumes because the phages mix and reduce their effectiveness.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- r = recombination fraction (the fraction of the parental sequence preserved)\n- P = probability of a plume coming from the parental phage\n- Q = probability of a plume coming from the non-parental phage\n\nIf there is complete recombination, r=1, and all plumes come from the parentals. If there's no recombination, r=0, and all plumes are non-recombinant.\n\nGiven the data:\n- First sample (strain B): 40 plumes\n- Second sample (strain K): 4 plumes\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the second sample would have similar plume counts as the first, but with recombination, the second sample would have fewer. To find the recombination rate, we can compare the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of plumes after recombination:\n\nN = N0 * e^{-r}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Another approach is to consider the ratio of plumes between the two samples. Since the phages have undergone recombination, the ratio of plumes should reflect the level of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the total number of phages in each sample is the same. Then, the ratio of plumes (K to B) is 4/40 = 1/10. This means that the second sample is 10 times less likely to produce plumes than the first. If there was no recombination, the ratio would remain the same. With recombination, the ratio decreases because the phages are mixed.\n\nThe decrease in plume count due to recombination can be modeled using the formula:\n\nln(r) = ln(N_B / N_K)\n\nBut I might be getting ahead of myself. Let's try another angle. The number of plumes is related to the probability of each phage surviving. If there's recombination, the survival probabilities change.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the first sample (strain B) would have a certain number of plumes, and the second sample (strain K) would have a similar number due to the same phage pool. But with recombination, the second sample has fewer plumes, indicating that the phages are more likely to be non-recombinant.\n\nThe key is to estimate the recombination fraction (r) such that the observed plume ratio reflects the expected outcome. Given that the second sample has 10 times fewer plumes than the first, this suggests that the recombination rate is high.\n\nUsing the formula for the number of plumes after recombination:\n\nP = (1 - r) * p + r * sqrt(p(1-p))\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach. Instead, let's think about the likelihood of recombination needed to explain the observation.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is r, then the probability of observing the given plume distribution is highest at a particular value of r. We can set up equations based on the observed plume numbers and solve for r.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, which is 40:4 or 10:1. This suggests that the second sample is ten times more likely to lose plumes due to recombination. The probability of losing plumes due to recombination can be expressed as r, so the observed ratio is influenced by r.\n\nThe formula for the expected plume count after recombination is:\n\nN_expected = N0 * e^{-r}\n\nBut since the actual plume count is N0*(1 - r), assuming that each plume has a probability r of being lost due to recombination. Therefore, the ratio of plumes would be approximately 1/(1 - r).\n\nGiven that the observed ratio is 4/40 = 1/10, we can set up:\n\n1/(1 - r) \u2248 1/10\n\nSolving for r gives:\n\n1 - r \u2248 10\n\nWhich would imply r \u2248 -9, which doesn't make sense because r cannot be negative. Therefore, my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination rate. So, if the recombination rate is r, the plume count scales with 1/sqrt(r).\n\nGiven that the plume count ratio is 40:4 = 10:1, we can write:\n\nsqrt(r) = sqrt(40/4) = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16\n\nTherefore, r \u2248 (1/3.16)^2 \u2248 0.102.\n\nSo, the recombination fraction r is approximately 0.102, meaning about 10% of the time the phages are recombined.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest answer is F. 0.3 percent, but our calculation is around 10%, which is much higher. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check again. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of survivors. If recombination occurs frequently, more plumes will survive because the mixture reduces the chance of loss. Therefore, a lower recombination rate would lead to more plumes surviving.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, r \u2248 0.102, which is about 10%. None of the options match exactly.

Therefore:\n\n(1 - r) = 1/10\n\nThus, r = 1 - 1/10 = 0.9\n\nThat's 90% recombination, which is way too high.

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes on B and 4 on K.\n\nThe key here is the concept of double-strand break (DSB) formation during replication. Recombination refers to how different regions of the T_4 phage integrate into the host genome. If two mutations are from the same locus, like recombination, then the chance that a DSB forms depends on the distance between the mutation sites. But if the mutations are from different loci, they might form DSBs more easily. However, in this case, we have two different mutants; one that integrates into T_4 and another that doesn't. Wait, no\u2014the phage has two copies of the T_4 genome? Or maybe it's integrating into one copy. Hmm, perhaps the presence of two mutants could lead to double-strand breaks depending on their positions.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the probability of a DSB occurring at each site. For each mutation, the chance that a DSB occurs within the T_4 genome is proportional to the length of the region where the mutation is located. If the two mutations are close together, the probability increases. If they're far apart, the probability decreases. Since the experiment shows that the strain B is mostly affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage caused DSBs that were replicated enough to cause lysis, whereas the other type didn't replicate as well. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage had a mutation that allowed it to integrate into T_4, causing a DSB that was replicated multiple times, leading to lysis.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination would mean that the mutations are integrated into the same T_4 copy. If they are from different T_4 copies, then they wouldn't recombine. So, if the mutations occurred in the same T_4 copy, the chance of DSB forming is higher than if they were in different copies.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phage is lysogenic and carries a mutation in rII, it may integrate into T_4, creating a DSB that allows lysis. If the second mutation is from the same T_4 copy, then both mutations would be in the same T_4 copy, increasing the chance of DSBs. Conversely, if the second mutation comes from a different T_4 copy, it would decrease the likelihood of DSBs.\n\nLooking at the results: when the phage is lysogenic (causing rII), the host is mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage caused DSBs. When the phage is mutant (no integration into T_4?), the host isn't affected much. Wait, maybe the phage is either lysogenic (with a mutation in rII) or lysogenic without a mutation. Or perhaps the phage has both mutations\u2014like one that integrates into T_4 and one that doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII that prevents it from integrating into T_4. Therefore, when placed alone, it wouldn't cause lysis because T_4 wouldn't have the mutation. But when combined with the non-integrating phage (which doesn't affect T_4), the lysogenic phage can integrate into T_4, causing a DSB and lysis. This explains why strain B is mostly affected because the lysogenic phage with rII mutation integrated into T_4, causing DSBs. However, when the lysogenic phage lacks the rII mutation, it doesn't integrate into T_4, so the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis even though it's a mutant.\n\nSo, now, looking at the test results:\n\n- The first half (diluted 1:10^7) is placed on strain B's lawn. Only 40 plumes (infections) are observed.\n- The second half (diluted 1:10^5) is placed on strain K's lawn. 4 plumes are observed.\n\nThis suggests that the phages responsible for lysis (the lysogenic ones) are being expressed better on strain B compared to strain K. But wait, actually, the expression level affects the number of plumes, but in this case, it's the combination of factors. \n\nWait, actually, the experiment measures the number of plumes. Plumes represent successful infections. Strain B is mostly affected, meaning the lysogenic phages with mutations are causing lysis. When placed on strain K's lawn, fewer plumes are seen, suggesting that the phages aren't infecting as much on strain K. Maybe because strain K doesn't have the lysogenic phage, or because the lysogenic phage can't integrate into T_4?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages' activity depends on the strain. But given that the question is about recombination between the two mutations, I'm focusing on whether both mutations are in the same T_4 copy.\n\nIf both mutations are in the same T_4 copy, then the chance of DSB formation is higher, leading to more infections. In the experiment, when the phage was lysogenic and had the rII mutation (potentially integrating into T_4), it caused lysis, so it was present on strain B. On strain K, the same phage wasn't present, so it didn't cause lysis, hence fewer plumes.\n\nWhen both types were present, half the culture (diluted 1:10^7) was placed on strain B's lawn, showing 40 plumes. The other half (diluted 1:10^5) was placed on strain K's lawn, showing 4 plumes.\n\nSo, the presence of the lysogenic phage (mutant) on strain B led to more infections (more plumes), while the same lysogenic phage on strain K didn't infect as well (fewer plumes).\n\nWait, but when both types are present, the phage mixture affects the outcome. If the lysogenic phage (mutant) is present, it will cause lysis more often, so strain B gets more plumes. When the lysogenic phage (non-integrating) is present, it doesn't cause lysis, so strain K has fewer plumes.\n\nNow, considering the presence of two mutants, one causing DSBs (lysogenic with rII mutation) and one that doesn't integrate (mutant without rII), when both are present, the lysogenic one causes DSBs that replicate enough to cause lysis, thus affecting the population on strain B. On strain K, the presence of the lysogenic non-integrating phage doesn't cause lysis, so fewer plumes.\n\nTo determine recombination, we need to see if the mutations are in the same T_4 copy. If they are, then the chance of DSBs is higher. If they are independent, lower.\n\nGiven that on strain B, the lysogenic phage with rII mutation leads to more infections, and on strain K, the same lysogenic phage (without mutation) doesn't infect as much, it suggests that the lysogenic phage's ability to integrate into T_4 is necessary for lysis. Thus, the two mutations must be in the same T_4 copy, meaning they recombined.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. To find this, we can use the formula related to the probability of DSBs. The probability of DSB is proportional to the length of the region where the mutation occurs. Assuming that both mutations occur in the same T_4 copy, their distances from each other matter.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L as the total length of the T_4 genome. Suppose each mutation affects a segment of length l1 and l2 respectively. If they are in the same copy, the effective distance between them is d = l1 + l2 - overlap.\n\nThe probability of a DSB at each location is p1 and p2. The overall probability of having a DSB anywhere along the genome would be p_total = p1 + p2 - p1*p2*overlap.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since the mutations are linked (recombined), the probability of DSBs near each other is higher. So, the chance that both mutations create DSBs nearby is increased.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage with rII mutation integrates into T_4, causing DSBs. The lysogenic phage without rII mutation doesn\u2019t integrate, so no DSBs. On strain B, when the lysogenic phage with mutation is present, it causes more DSBs, leading to more infections. On strain K, the lysogenic phage without mutation doesn't cause DSBs, so fewer infections.\n\nThus, the presence of both mutations in the same T_4 copy explains the difference in plume counts between the strains.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency. The recombination frequency (f) is calculated using the formula:\n\nf = [(p1 + p2) / L]^2\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the probabilities of a DSB at each mutation site.\n\nAssuming that each mutation creates a DSB independently, but due to recombination, their sites are closer, increasing the probability of both happening.\n\nFrom the data, the number of plumes indicates the relative frequencies. Since the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B leads to more infections, the chance of DSBs near its location is higher. Similarly, the lysogenic phage without mutation on strain K has a lower chance of causing DSBs.\n\nAssuming the two mutations are in the same T_4 copy, the distance between them determines the probability of DSBs. If they are close, the probability is higher; if far apart, it's lower.\n\nIn this experiment, the presence of both mutations in the same T_4 copy leads to the observed effect. Now, to find the percentage of recombination, we can estimate based on the number of plumes.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, strain K has 4. The ratio is 40:4, or 10:1, indicating that the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B is more likely to cause lysis than on strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with mutation is more effective on strain B, possibly due to better integration into T_4, which is a sign of recombination.\n\nCalculating recombination frequency, assuming equal lengths for both mutations (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise):\n\nEach mutation contributes a certain probability of DSB. Let's assume that each mutation has a probability p of causing a DSB. Due to recombination, the probability that both happen is higher. If recombination occurs, say, f fraction of the time, then the combined probability becomes p1 + p2 - p1*p2*f.\n\nBut in our case, both mutations are linked, so f=1, meaning they always recombine. Wait, no\u2014if they are in the same T_4 copy, recombination (integation) happens, making them linked. So, their locations are very close, and the probability of both events happening is high.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B leads to more infections, which aligns with the idea that the lysogenic phage with mutation is effectively integrating into T_4, causing DSBs. On strain K, the lysogenic phage without mutation doesn't cause DSBs, so fewer infections.\n\nTherefore, the two mutations are likely recombined into the same T_4 copy, leading to higher chances of DSBs and more infections.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula derived from the experiment. Given that the presence of both mutations leads to more infections on strain B, the recombination must be significant. Calculations suggest that approximately 1% of the time, the two mutations are recombined.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1% corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

If they are in the same copy, the effective distance between them is d = l1 + l2 - overlap.\n\nThe probability of a DSB at each location is p1 and p2. The overall probability of having a DSB anywhere along the genome would be p_total = p1 + p2 - p1*p2*overlap.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, since the mutations are linked (recombined), the probability of DSBs near each other is higher. So, the chance that both mutations create DSBs nearby is increased.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage with rII mutation integrates into T_4, causing DSBs. The lysogenic phage without rII mutation doesn\u2019t integrate, so no DSBs. On strain B, when the lysogenic phage with mutation is present, it causes more DSBs, leading to more infections. On strain K, the lysogenic phage without mutation doesn't cause DSBs, so fewer infections.\n\nThus, the presence of both mutations in the same T_4 copy explains the difference in plume counts between the strains.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency. The recombination frequency (f) is calculated using the formula:\n\nf = [(p1 + p2) / L]^2\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the probabilities of a DSB at each mutation site.\n\nAssuming that each mutation creates a DSB independently, but due to recombination, their sites are closer, increasing the probability of both happening.\n\nFrom the data, the number of plumes indicates the relative frequencies. Since the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B leads to more infections, the chance of DSBs near its location is higher. Similarly, the lysogenic phage without mutation on strain K has a lower chance of causing DSBs.\n\nAssuming the two mutations are in the same T_4 copy, the distance between them determines the probability of DSBs. If they are close, the probability is higher; if far apart, it's lower.\n\nIn this experiment, the presence of both mutations in the same T_4 copy leads to the observed effect. Now, to find the percentage of recombination, we can estimate based on the number of plumes.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, strain K has 4. The ratio is 40:4, or 10:1, indicating that the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B is more likely to cause lysis than on strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with mutation is more effective on strain B, possibly due to better integration into T_4, which is a sign of recombination.\n\nCalculating recombination frequency, assuming equal lengths for both mutations (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise):\n\nEach mutation contributes a certain probability of DSB. Let's assume that each mutation has a probability p of causing a DSB. Due to recombination, the probability that both happen is higher. If recombination occurs, say, f fraction of the time, then the combined probability becomes p1 + p2 - p1*p2*f.\n\nBut in our case, both mutations are linked, so f=1, meaning they always recombine. Wait, no\u2014if they are in the same T_4 copy, recombination (integation) happens, making them linked. So, their locations are very close, and the probability of both events happening is high.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage with mutation on strain B leads to more infections, which aligns with the idea that the lysogenic phage with mutation is effectively integrating into T_4, causing DSBs. On strain K, the lysogenic phage without mutation doesn't cause DSBs, so fewer infections.\n\nTherefore, the two mutations are likely recombined into the same T_4 copy, leading to higher chances of DSBs and more infections.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula derived from the experiment. Given that the presence of both mutations leads to more infections on strain B, the recombination must be significant. Calculations suggest that approximately 1% of the time, the two mutations are recombined.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1% corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

    "chunk_resampled": "So four plumes mean four successful infections, right?",
    "rollout": " So four plumes mean four successful infections, right? \n\nHmm, I think I remember something about the Poisson distribution here. Since the number of events (infections) follows a Poisson distribution, we can use the observed counts to estimate the expected values under different scenarios. In the first case, only the lysogenic phage is present, so all infections should be on B. If the mutation is present in both types of phage, then the occurrence of lysogeny should be linked, leading to more interactions where both types cause issues together. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again. In the first scenario, only the lysogenic phage is present, so any lytic phage (mutant) won't cause problems. So if you have two types of phages, one causing lysis and the other causing lysogeny, the presence of lysogeny would affect the lytic ones. But when both types are present, the effect might depend on whether they share the same mutation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is about double mutants or co-mutation. The fact that four plumes appear on K suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is interacting with the lysogenic phage from strain K. Each plume represents a successful infection, so four plumes mean four double mutants. Similarly, 40 plumes on B might indicate that without K's lysogenic phage, most infections occur on B alone. \n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"recombination\" between the two mutations. Recombination usually refers to genetic recombination between homologous chromosomes, but here it's within the T_4 phage's DNA, so it's about the mutations themselves. Maybe this relates to how often the mutations interact\u2014like whether the lysogenic state of one affects the lysogenic state of the other. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the cells are mostly on B, meaning that the lysogenic phage from B interacts with the lysogenic phage from K. Each interaction could lead to some combination. The number of plumes indicates how many times the two types interacted. \n\nIf each interaction leads to one double mutant, then the number of interactions would equal the number of double mutants. So four plumes suggest four interactions, which means four instances where both types of phages caused problems. Now, the question is asking for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The presence of both mutations likely creates a new type of phage that integrates into the bacterial genome, increasing the likelihood of future interactions. The frequency of such interactions depends on their linkage. For example, if two mutations are tightly linked, they will interact more frequently than if they're far apart. \n\nThe ratio of plumes on each lawn tells us about the frequencies of the different outcomes. On strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, there are 4. That's a 10:1 ratio. This ratio is related to the Poisson parameter lambda, which is the average number of events per interval. In a Poisson distribution, lambda equals the mean. Here, the observed counts don't exactly match the expectation, so I need to calculate the expected number of double mutants under the assumption of independent mutations versus dependent mutations.\n\nUnder independent mutations (no recombination), the expected number of double mutants would be (number on B)^2 / total. Wait, let me clarify: the total number of bacteria after dilution is proportional to the concentration. Alternatively, using the formula for double mutants, the expected count on the lawn is (n_B * n_K) / (n_B + n_K), where n_B and n_K are the dilutions. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAnother way is to consider the Poisson ratio. The observed counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. The ratio is 10:1. Under independent mutations, the expected number of double mutants would be lower than that, while under dependent mutations (recombination), the number would be higher. The formula for the Poisson parameter is lambda = ln(N/expected), but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the ratio of the observed counts. On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes; on K's, 4. That's a 10:1 ratio. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the probability of interaction increases, leading to more double mutants. Conversely, if they are loose, fewer interactions happen, resulting in fewer double mutants. \n\nSince the observed ratio is much higher on B's lawn, it suggests that the mutations interact more strongly on B's lawn, implying stronger recombination. But wait, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome. \n\nI think the correct approach is to use the ratio of the observed counts as an indicator of the strength of recombination. The ratio R is given by R = (n_B * n_K) / (n_B + n_K). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the formula for the ratio of double mutants is R = (n_B * n_K) / (n_B + n_K). But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of double mutants (plumes) on strain B's lawn is 40, and on K's lawn is 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the probability of interaction (recombination) is much higher on B's lawn, indicating stronger recombination. However, the exact calculation requires knowing the formula relating the ratio to the percentage of recombination.\n\nUpon further reflection, I recall that the Poisson ratio \u03bb is calculated as ln(R), where R is the ratio of the observed counts. So, ln(10) \u2248 2.3. To find the percentage of recombination, I think we take this value and convert it into a percentage. But I'm not certain if it's 10%, which isn't an option here. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is used differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is \u03bb = ln(R), where R is the ratio of the observed counts. So, ln(10) \u2248 2.3. Converting this into a percentage would involve multiplying by 100, giving approximately 230%. But that doesn't make sense because percentages shouldn't exceed 100%.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship. Another approach is to consider the number of double mutants. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the number of double mutants would increase significantly compared to independent mutations. The observed ratio of 10:1 suggests that the mutations interact more frequently, leading to more double mutants on B's lawn. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we might use the formula: recombination frequency = (ln(R)) \u00d7 (1 - p), where p is the frequency of the wildtype mutation. But without knowing p, this approach seems complicated.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest to 1% or 2% makes sense. Considering that recombination in T_4 phages is typically measured in percentages, and given the ratio of 10:1, it's likely that the recombination percentage falls somewhere around 2-3%. Looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, and H is 1.5%. Between these, 0.3% is the smallest, followed by 0.5%, then 1.5%.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct formula for the Poisson parameter is \u03bb = ln(R), where R is the ratio of observed counts. So for R=10, \u03bb\u22482.3. To find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we multiply \u03bb by 100, giving 230%, which is too high. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination is 100 - e^{-\u03bb}, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula: r = 100 \u00d7 (1 - e^{-\u03bb}), where \u03bb is the Poisson parameter derived from the ratio of counts. Using \u03bb=2.3, e^{-2.3}\u22480.10, so r\u2248100\u00d7(1-0.10)=90%. But that's also not matching the options given. \n\nPerhaps my initial assumption was incorrect. Let me try another angle. The observed counts are 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. The ratio of B to K is 10:1. In a Poisson process, the expected number of double mutants would be (n_B * n_K) / (n_B + n_K). Plugging in, n_B=40, n_K=4: (40*4)/(40+4)=160/44\u22483.64. The observed double mutants are 4, which is close to the expected value. \n\nThis suggests that the recombination is low because the observed number is slightly higher than expected under independence. Therefore, the percentage of recombination must be low. Given the options, 0.3% (F) is the lowest. However, the actual calculation might require more precise steps. \n\nAfter reconsidering, I realize that the correct formula to relate the ratio of counts to recombination frequency is r = 1 - e^{-\u03bb}, where \u03bb is derived from the ratio. If the observed ratio is 10:1, then \u03bb = ln(10) \u2248 2.3. Thus, r = 1 - e^{-2.3} \u2248 1 - 0.0997 \u2248 0.9003, which is about 90%, but that's not among the options. \n\nI must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct formula uses the square root of the ratio. Or maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, 40 vs 4, which simplifies to 10:1, suggests that recombination is high. But none of the options go beyond 5%. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If the mutations are tightly linked, the probability of interaction increases, leading to more double mutants. The observed ratio of 10:1 implies that the recombination rate is high, but the exact percentage isn't clear. \n\nGiven the options, and recalling similar problems, the correct answer is likely C. 1.5 percent.

Recombination here would mean that the two mutations have combined their effects. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, causing more efficient replication. Alternatively, if they cause different replication mechanisms, maybe the lysogenic phage could lyse the lysogen, leading to more lysogenic phages being produced, thus increasing the number of resistant phages. This increased resistance could explain why strain B has fewer plumes\u2014meaning less resistance than expected from pure lysogenic phages.\n\nNow, looking at the dilutions: one half is 1:10^7 and the other is 1:10^5. The ratio of plumes depends on how effective the combination is. If the two phages combine successfully, the resulting phage should replicate more efficiently, meaning more phages should be produced without being lysed. So the efficiency of the phage population after combining would affect the number of plumes observed.\n\nIn the case where the two phages do recombine, the number of successful infections (plumes) would increase compared to when they don't recombine. Since the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected, implying reduced resistance, perhaps indicating that the lysogenic phage is more resistant. However, in the presence of another mutation, the effect changes. \n\nWait, no\u2014the description says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse cells) isn't as effective as before, possibly due to the presence of the other mutation. But in reality, when two different phages infect the same cell, their combinations can lead to either increased or decreased replication efficiency depending on whether they recombine.\n\nIf the two phages recombine, the resultant phage may have a higher replication efficiency, leading to more resistant offspring. However, in this case, strain B is mainly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage isn't as effective as it should be. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is less effective when another mutation is present, leading to lower resistance.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the numbers. On the first plate, half was 1:10^7 and the other half 1:10^5. After plating on strain B, we saw 40 plumes. On strain K, we saw 4. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Normally, the more dilution you have, the fewer plumes you'd expect because the phage population is lower. But here, the 1:10^7 half had more plumes (40) than the 1:10^5 half (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense because a higher dilution means a lower concentration, so you'd expect fewer plumes. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the \"diluted\" refers to the number of phages present. So the 1:10^7 solution has fewer phages, so fewer infections occur, hence fewer plumes. Conversely, the 1:10^5 solution has more phages, so more infections occur, more plumes. But according to the data, the 1:10^7 half led to 40 plumes, and the 1:10^5 half had 4. That contradicts expectations because higher dilution should lead to fewer plumes, not more. Maybe the opposite is happening, meaning the 1:10^5 half is more susceptible, but that doesn't fit with the initial observation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"diluted\" refers to the number of phages per mL, and a higher dilution leads to more phages. So the 1:10^7 solution has fewer phages, so fewer plumes (40), and the 1:10^5 solution has more phages, more plumes (4). That fits. So when the phages are more concentrated (higher dilution), more plumes occur because more phages are present.\n\nNow, considering that, if the two mutations recombine, the phage population's replication efficiency increases, leading to more resistant offspring. Thus, the presence of both mutations would result in more resistance, which would reduce the number of plumes because more phages are killed off upon replication.\n\nIn our case, when both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B shows reduced resistance, meaning less resistance than expected for the lysogenic phage alone. That suggests that the presence of the other mutation decreases the overall resistance. Perhaps the presence of the other mutation leads to a decrease in the number of resistant phages, which could happen if the mutations are interacting to produce a more efficient phage.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage (without mutation) would lyse the lysogenic phage, making it non-viable. The presence of another mutation might allow the lysogenic phage to survive better, thereby reducing its population. Or perhaps the other mutation allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively, leading to more resistant offspring. Either way, the key point is that the presence of the second mutation reduces the number of resistant phages, which would increase the number of resistant phages detected on the lawn.\n\nBut in our case, when both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B shows fewer plumes (40 vs. if only lysogenic, maybe 80?), but the question states that it's mostly affected, meaning less resistance. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\n- Strain B is primarily affected, meaning it's more susceptible to the lysogenic phage. Or perhaps it's less resistant. Wait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't lyse the lysogenic phage itself; instead, it would replicate and cause lysis of the host cell. So strain B should be resistant to lysogenic phages unless there's another mutation that allows the lysogenic phage to replicate without being killed.\n\nSo if both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently, leading to lower resistance. Therefore, when both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected, meaning the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause lysis of the lysogenic phage, rendering them non-viable. Thus, the number of resistant phages (from lysogenic phages) would be lower, leading to fewer plumes on the lawn.\n\nWait, but the question says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected. So the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, so fewer plumes. Now, if the two mutations recombine, the phage population becomes more efficient, leading to more resistant offspring. Therefore, the number of resistant phages would be higher, meaning fewer plumes? No, wait: higher resistance would mean more plumes because more phages are killed. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the context.\n\nActually, let me correct myself. If the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently due to the presence of the other mutation, then the number of resistant phages (from lysogenic phages) would decrease, leading to fewer plumes because fewer phages are resistant. However, if the phages recombine and become more efficient, they would replicate more, killing more phages, leading to more resistant offspring and more plumes.\n\nBut in this case, the presence of both mutations causes strain B to be primarily affected, meaning fewer plumes. If the mutations recombine and make the phage more efficient, more plumes would be seen because more phages are resistant. Therefore, the observed reduction in plumes (40 vs., say, 80 if only lysogenic) indicates that the mutations are causing some loss of resistance, which could be due to the loss of efficiency from the other mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The key is to determine the level of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination typically increases the efficiency of the phage population, leading to more resistant offspring. So if the two mutations recombine, the number of resistant phages would be higher, leading to more plumes. However, in our case, the number of plumes is lower than expected from pure lysogenic phages, indicating that the lysogenic phage is less effective, perhaps due to the presence of another mutation that prevents it from replicating well.\n\nTherefore, if the two mutations recombine, it could lead to a situation where the lysogenic phage is less effective, which matches the observation. But I'm supposed to calculate the percentage of recombination based on the observed data.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes depends on the number of viable phages. If recombination occurs, the phage population becomes more efficient, leading to more plumes. However, in our case, the presence of both mutations reduces the number of plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is less effective because of the other mutation. This might indicate that the two mutations interact to reduce the lysogenic phage's effectiveness.\n\nBut to quantify recombination, perhaps I need to use the formula for estimating the degree of recombination. The degree of recombination (R) can be estimated using the formula R = (p*q - e)/(sqrt(p*q)), where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles involved in recombination, and e is the efficiency loss due to recombination. However, I'm not sure if this applies directly here.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the observed effect on the number of plumes can be used to estimate the extent of recombination. For example, if recombination occurs, the number of resistant phages would increase, leading to more plumes. In our case, the number of plumes is lower than expected, so recombination must be occurring to reduce the number of resistant phages.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose that without recombination, the number of resistant phages (R) is N. With recombination, the number of resistant phages increases to M > N. However, in our case, the number of resistant phages is lower than expected, so M </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 4 plumes mean 4 infections on K, and 40 on B.\n\nThe goal is to find the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here would mean that the two mutations have combined their effects. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, causing more efficient replication. Alternatively, if they cause different replication mechanisms, maybe the lysogenic phage could lyse the lysogen, leading to more lysogenic phages being produced, thus increasing the number of resistant phages. This increased resistance could explain why strain B has fewer plumes\u2014meaning less resistance than expected from pure lysogenic phages.\n\nNow, looking at the dilutions: one half is 1:10^7 and the other is 1:10^5. The ratio of plumes depends on how effective the combination is. If the two phages combine successfully, the resulting phage should replicate more efficiently, meaning more phages should be produced without being lysed. So the efficiency of the phage population after combining would affect the number of plumes observed.\n\nIn the case where the two phages do recombine, the number of successful infections (plumes) would increase compared to when they don't recombine. Since the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected, implying reduced resistance, perhaps indicating that the lysogenic phage is more resistant. However, in the presence of another mutation, the effect changes. \n\nWait, no\u2014the description says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse cells) isn't as effective as before, possibly due to the presence of the other mutation. But in reality, when two different phages infect the same cell, their combinations can lead to either increased or decreased replication efficiency depending on whether they recombine.\n\nIf the two phages recombine, the resultant phage may have a higher replication efficiency, leading to more resistant offspring. However, in this case, strain B is mainly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage isn't as effective as it should be. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is less effective when another mutation is present, leading to lower resistance.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the numbers. On the first plate, half was 1:10^7 and the other half 1:10^5. After plating on strain B, we saw 40 plumes. On strain K, we saw 4. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Normally, the more dilution you have, the fewer plumes you'd expect because the phage population is lower. But here, the 1:10^7 half had more plumes (40) than the 1:10^5 half (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense because a higher dilution means a lower concentration, so you'd expect fewer plumes. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the \"diluted\" refers to the number of phages present. So the 1:10^7 solution has fewer phages, so fewer infections occur, hence fewer plumes. Conversely, the 1:10^5 solution has more phages, so more infections occur, more plumes.

    "rollout": " So if the number of plumes observed corresponds to the number of successful infections, then higher numbers indicate more efficient interaction.\n\nIn the first half, the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning each plate has 1e7 phages. If the number of plumes is low, say 40, it suggests fewer interactions occurred at that concentration. In the second half, the dilution is 1e5, so each plate has 1e5 phages, leading to more plumes, like 4. So the lower concentration leads to less interaction efficiency. That makes sense because if you dilute too much, you reduce the chance of phages infecting the bacteria effectively.\n\nThe experiment also says that the initial infection caused some split, halved the population. Then one half was plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. On strain B, 40 plumes were found, and on strain K, 4. The difference in plumes indicates the effectiveness of the recombination. Since the B plates showed more plumes than the K plates, it suggests that the recombination between the two mutants increased the probability of successful infection when both were present.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. Recombination refers to the likelihood that two different genetic elements have combined. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut wait, in phage experiments, the number of plumes observed can be used to estimate RF. The general approach is to use the ratio of plumes from each strain. If the two strains are independent, we'd expect a certain ratio, but here we're seeing that when both are present, the presence of one mutation affects the other.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the expected number of recombinants is:\n\nExpected recombinants = (n1 + n2 - 2) \u00d7 (probability of recombination)\n\nWait, maybe another way is better. Since the number of plumes depends on how many times the phages successfully integrated the two mutations. The key point is that when both mutants are present, their interaction increases the probability of successful infection.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K. This suggests that the combination of the two mutations is more effective, meaning that the recombination rate is high.\n\nLet me think about the possible options. The answer choices range from 0.02% to 5%. Recombination rates typically depend on how often the two mutations integrate. For bacterial phages, if the two mutations are linked, the recombination rate would be high, around 5-10%.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain B is higher, it implies that when both mutants are present, the chance of integration is higher. So the recombination rate must be significant enough to cause more plumes on strain B compared to strain K.\n\nLooking back, when both types are present, the plumes increase in favor of one strain over the other. This is due to the increased efficiency of the phage lysis when both mutations are present because the phages can better integrate the two mutations. However, in reality, the presence of the lysogenic phage may interfere with the lysogenically expressed phages, reducing the overall efficiency.\n\nThe exact calculation might involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently and then combining them. The formula for the probability of recombination (P) is approximately P = p * q, where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. However, without knowing the individual mutation frequencies, we might infer based on the plume counts.\n\nSince the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K, the recombination frequency must account for this difference. To get the percentage, let's assume that the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes reflects the probability of successful infection.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 5%, as one of the options, that could explain why the plumes are more frequent on strain B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if the number of plumes observed corresponds to the number of successful infections, then higher numbers indicate more efficient interaction.\n\nIn the first half, the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning each plate has 1e7 phages. If the number of plumes is low, say 40, it suggests fewer interactions occurred at that concentration. In the second half, the dilution is 1e5, so each plate has 1e5 phages, leading to more plumes, like 4. So the lower concentration leads to less interaction efficiency. That makes sense because if you dilute too much, you reduce the chance of phages infecting the bacteria effectively.\n\nThe experiment also says that the initial infection caused some split, halved the population. Then one half was plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. On strain B, 40 plumes were found, and on strain K, 4. The difference in plumes indicates the effectiveness of the recombination. Since the B plates showed more plumes than the K plates, it suggests that the recombination between the two mutants increased the probability of successful infection when both were present.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. Recombination refers to the likelihood that two different genetic elements have combined. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut wait, in phage experiments, the number of plumes observed can be used to estimate RF. The general approach is to use the ratio of plumes from each strain. If the two strains are independent, we'd expect a certain ratio, but here we're seeing that when both are present, the presence of one mutation affects the other.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the expected number of recombinants is:\n\nExpected recombinants = (n1 + n2 - 2) \u00d7 (probability of recombination)\n\nWait, maybe another way is better. Since the number of plumes depends on how many times the phages successfully integrated the two mutations. The key point is that when both mutants are present, their interaction increases the probability of successful infection.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K. This suggests that the combination of the two mutations is more effective, meaning that the recombination rate is high.\n\nLet me think about the possible options. The answer choices range from 0.02% to 5%. Recombination rates typically depend on how often the two mutations integrate. For bacterial phages, if the two mutations are linked, the recombination rate would be high, around 5-10%.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain B is higher, it implies that when both mutants are present, the chance of integration is higher. So the recombination rate must be significant enough to cause more plumes on strain B compared to strain K.\n\nLooking back, when both types are present, the plumes increase in favor of one strain over the other. This is due to the increased efficiency of the phage lysis when both mutations are present because the phages can better integrate the two mutations. However, in reality, the presence of the lysogenic phage may interfere with the lysogenically expressed phages, reducing the overall efficiency.\n\nThe exact calculation might involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently and then combining them. The formula for the probability of recombination (P) is approximately P = p * q, where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. However, without knowing the individual mutation frequencies, we might infer based on the plume counts.\n\nSince the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K, the recombination frequency must account for this difference. To get the percentage, let's assume that the recombination frequency is such that the number of plumes reflects the probability of successful infection.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 5%, as one of the options, that could explain why the plumes are more frequent on strain B. Alternatively, considering the reciprocal relationship, perhaps the correct answer is D: 0.05%, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the ratio of plumes. If strain B had 4 plumes and strain K had 40, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused a decrease in the success rate of the lysogenic phage, which aligns with the idea of recombination increasing the chance of lysogen integration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely scenario is that the recombination frequency is around 5%, making option C the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " So if there are more plumes on K than on B, maybe that indicates more recombination because the lysogenic phage might cause more infections when combined with another phage type.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. If the two phages interact, their combination could lead to more efficient infection. For example, in double phage systems, sometimes you get synergistic effects where both phages infect the same cells, leading to more plasmid loss or more successful infection. In this case, the lysogenic phage should lose its prophage, causing lysis and death of the E. coli. The lytic phage would replicate and take over the prophage, potentially causing more lysogenic phage to survive. But since only lysogenic phage did anything bad in pure culture B, perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate with another phage without losing its prophage. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that makes it more likely to combine with another phage, increasing the chance that both phages will infect the same cells, leading to more lysogenic phages surviving and causing more lysozyme breakdown.\n\nThe key point here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, typically seen in things like transposons moving between chromosomes. However, in phages, particularly in the T_4 phage system, the recombination usually refers to the transfer of prophages from one phage to another, often mediated by a prophage host. So, in this case, if the lysogenic phage (with the mutation in rII) transfers its prophage to another phage, it might integrate into a different phage, allowing for better interaction. But wait, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to lyse the cell once it loses its prophage. So maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate into another phage without losing its prophage.\n\nAlternatively, the lysogenic phage might have a mutation that allows it to lose its prophage without losing all its genetic information, effectively integrating into another phage. This would increase the likelihood that both phages infect the same cells, leading to more lysogenic phage infections.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this methodically. The problem states that the lysogenic phage (which should lyse and kill E. coli) was present in the presence of the lytic phage (which should replicate and cause lysis), and this led to the lysogenic phage being killed. However, when both types are present together, only the lysogenic phage caused damage. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate into the lytic phage without losing its prophage. This would mean that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage can successfully infect cells that also have the lytic phage, leading to more lysogenic phage infections overall. Conversely, the lytic phage cannot integrate into itself because it already lost its prophage.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment: half the bacteria are plated on strain B's lawn, and half on strain K's. The half plated on B had more plumes (40 vs. 4 on the K side). Wait, actually, the wording says \"plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B\" and \"plated on strain K\". But the numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems off because the number should depend on the efficiency of the phage. If both phages are present, the lysogenic phage should infect more cells, hence more plumes. But in this case, the lysogenic phage didn't cause as many infections on the K side as on the B side. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbers.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The total number of cells plated on each lawn depends on whether the bacteria were split equally or not. Since the problem states that the first half is plated on strain B's lawn and the second half on strain K's, then the number of plumes observed should reflect the number of cells that were successfully lysed by each phage. On the B lawn, 40 plumes were found, meaning 40 cells were lysed. On the K lawn, 4 plumes were found, meaning only 4 cells were lysed. But this seems counterintuitive because the lysogenic phage should cause more lysing when both are present. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the results.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage should infect more cells because it can integrate into the lytic phage, making it more effective. Therefore, the K side, which is probably the strain that is less susceptible, might have fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage isn't as effective. Wait, no, the K phage is probably more resistant because it's the native E. coli strain. So if the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it should cause more lysing, leading to more plumes on the B side. But according to the data, the K side has only 4 plumes, while the B side has 40. That seems inconsistent because the lysogenic phage should cause more plumes when both are present.\n\nWait, maybe I got it wrong. If the lysogenic phage can integrate into the lytic phage, it can replicate within the lytic phage, leading to more lysogeny in the offspring. However, since the lysogenic phage already lost its prophage, it can't replicate further. Instead, it integrates into the lytic phage, becoming a new phage species. This integration increases the chance that both phages infect the same cells, leading to more lysogenic phage infections. Therefore, the K side, which is the native strain, would have fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage integrated into the lytic phage, leading to more lysogeny and thus fewer cells lysed. On the other hand, the B side, where the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate into any other phage, would have fewer lysed cells because the lysogenic phage can't replicate efficiently due to the loss of prophage.\n\nWait, but the numbers don't align. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient at lysing E. coli. Therefore, the K side, where the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, should have more plumes. But in reality, the B side has more plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is still capable of killing E. coli despite the lack of integration. That seems contradictory. Perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate into the lytic phage but instead somehow maintains its prophage, allowing it to replicate without losing it. This would allow it to infect the same cells multiple times, leading to more lysogeny and thus more plumes. However, if the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate into the lytic phage, it can only infect cells where the lytic phage is present, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage didn't lyse strain B, indicating that it couldn't replicate efficiently without the prophage. So perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to retain its prophage, enabling it to replicate even without losing it. This would make it more efficient at lysing E. coli, resulting in more plumes on the B side. However, the K side, where the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, should have more plumes because it can now replicate and cause more lysogeny.\n\nIn the experiment, the B side has more plumes (40) than the K side (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is less efficient on the B side because the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate into the lytic phage, whereas on the K side, it integrates and becomes more efficient. This would imply that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to retain its prophage, thereby allowing it to replicate without losing it. This integration into the lytic phage leads to more lysogeny and thus more plumes on the B side compared to the K side.\n\nTo determine the degree of recombination, we need to calculate how much of the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to retain its prophage. This would involve comparing the expected number of plumes under normal conditions versus those observed under the mutation.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the lysogenic phage would not retain its prophage, so it wouldn't replicate efficiently. However, when it retains its prophage, it can replicate and cause more lysogeny, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf we assume that recombination (integration) occurs with a certain rate, say R%, then the fraction of lysogenic phages that have retained their prophage is R%. Each such phage would cause more plumes than the wild-type version.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N_total = total number of lysogenic phages\n- N retains = number of lysogenic phages that retained their prophage (due to recombination)\n- N no-recombine = lysogenic phages that didn\u2019t integrate\n\nAssuming that each retains phage causes an additional number of plumes proportional to R%.\n\nSuppose that normally, each lysogenic phage causes 1 plume. With recombination, each retains phage causes 1 + R% plumes.\n\nGiven that the B side (without recombination) has 40 plumes and the K side (with recombination) has 4 plumes, we can set up equations.\n\nHowever, since the exact relationship might be more complex, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio of plumes to estimate R.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40/4=10. Assuming that without recombination, the plumes would be higher, but with recombination, the plumes decrease. So if the recombination reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10, it implies that 90% of the lysogenic phages retained their prophage. Because 10% would have lost it, reducing the plumes significantly.\n\nTherefore, recombination would be approximately 90%, but since the options don't include 90%, the closest option is D.05% or F.03%. Wait, none of the options go up to 90%. The highest is G.0.5% and H.0.02%. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes reflects the efficiency of integration. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient at lysing E. coli, leading to more plumes. The difference between B and K could indicate the level of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nNumber of plumes = N * (1 - R)\n\nWhere N is the number of phages, and R is the recombination rate. If N is the same on both sides, then the ratio of plumes is (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K). But without knowing N, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that recombination affects the probability of lysing each cell. If recombination increases the lysing efficiency, then the expected number of plumes would decrease proportionally.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a 90% chance of retaining its prophage (recombination of 10%), it would cause 90% of the lysogeny, leading to 10% fewer plumes. Hence, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor of 10, matching our observation (40 vs. 4).\n\nThus, recombination would be about 10%, which isn't an option directly. However, looking back at the options, the closest lower value is J.0.05% and I.0.02%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is using the reciprocal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient. Thus, the number of plumes decreases inversely with the efficiency. If the efficiency is 90%, then the number of plumes decreases by 10%. So 40 plumes correspond to 10% efficiency, implying 90% recombination. But again, that's not among the options.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the recombination fraction is calculated based on the ratio of plumes. Let's assume that each lysogenic phage that integrates into the lytic phage contributes 1 + R plumes, whereas without integration, it contributes 1. Then, the average number of plumes per phage would be (N retain)(1 + R) + (N no)(1) ) / N = 1 + (R/N). But without knowing N, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of plumes on B is 10 times that on K, and assuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phages would have been unable to integrate, leading to more plumes. But with recombination, the lysogenic phages integrate, reducing plumes. So, 10 times reduction in plumes could imply a 90% recombination rate.\n\nSince the options don't include 90%, perhaps the intended answer is C.1.5% or B.2%. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the percentage of cells that were lysed.\n\nOn the B side: 40 plumes, so 40 cells lysed.\nOn the K side: 4 plumes, so 4 cells lysed.\n\nTotal cells: Let's assume each culture was plated on 1 million cells. So, for the B side: 40 cells lysed out of 1,000,000, which is 0.004% or 4e-5. For the K side: 4 cells lysed out of 1,000,000, which is 0.004% or 4e-5.\n\nThe difference in recombination can be calculated as (4e-5 - 4e-5)/ (average) \u00d7 100% \u2192 0%. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. The actual recombination would affect the efficiency of lysing, not just the number of cells lysed. So, if the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient, leading to more lysogeny and more plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into the lytic phage on the B side, reducing the number of plumes by 90%. Thus, the recombination fraction is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the probability of recombination. Suppose that the recombination probability (R) determines the fraction of lysogenic phages that retained their prophage. Then, the efficiency of lysing each cell is proportional to R.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it causes more plumes. The ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrated into the lytic phage on the B side, reducing plumes by 90%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is lower.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are A to G, with G being 0.5% and H 0.02%. Given that my earlier reasoning suggested around 90% recombination, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination rate is inversely related to the plume density ratio.\n\nIf the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination rate is 90%, but perhaps the intended answer uses log(1/10)=log(0.1)= -2.3, which rounds to 0.02%, corresponding to option H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the base 10 logarithm of the plume density ratio. Log(40/4)=log(10)=1. So, 10^(-1)=0.1, which corresponds to 0.01% recombination, but that's not exactly precise. Alternatively, the change in plume density is a factor of 10, so the recombination rate is log(10)=1, but in terms of recombination fraction, it's e^(-\u0394), where \u0394 is the change in entropy or something else. This line of thought might be too complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the options available, I'll settle on option G.0.5% as the most reasonable choice based on the approximation that recombination reduces the plume density by a factor of 10, corresponding to a 90% recombination rate, but rounding down to the nearest given option. Alternatively, if the correct calculation yields a 0.05% recombination, that would match option J, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

However, the K side, where the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, should have more plumes because it can now replicate and cause more lysogeny.\n\nIn the experiment, the B side has more plumes (40) than the K side (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is less efficient on the B side because the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate into the lytic phage, whereas on the K side, it integrates and becomes more efficient. This would imply that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to retain its prophage, thereby allowing it to replicate without losing it. This integration into the lytic phage leads to more lysogeny and thus more plumes on the B side compared to the K side.\n\nTo determine the degree of recombination, we need to calculate how much of the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to retain its prophage. This would involve comparing the expected number of plumes under normal conditions versus those observed under the mutation.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the lysogenic phage would not retain its prophage, so it wouldn't replicate efficiently. However, when it retains its prophage, it can replicate and cause more lysogeny, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf we assume that recombination (integration) occurs with a certain rate, say R%, then the fraction of lysogenic phages that have retained their prophage is R%. Each such phage would cause more plumes than the wild-type version.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N_total = total number of lysogenic phages\n- N retains = number of lysogenic phages that retained their prophage (due to recombination)\n- N no-recombine = lysogenic phages that didn\u2019t integrate\n\nAssuming that each retains phage causes an additional number of plumes proportional to R%.\n\nSuppose that normally, each lysogenic phage causes 1 plume. With recombination, each retains phage causes 1 + R% plumes.\n\nGiven that the B side (without recombination) has 40 plumes and the K side (with recombination) has 4 plumes, we can set up equations.\n\nHowever, since the exact relationship might be more complex, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio of plumes to estimate R.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40/4=10. Assuming that without recombination, the plumes would be higher, but with recombination, the plumes decrease. So if the recombination reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10, it implies that 90% of the lysogenic phages retained their prophage. Because 10% would have lost it, reducing the plumes significantly.\n\nTherefore, recombination would be approximately 90%, but since the options don't include 90%, the closest option is D.05% or F.03%. Wait, none of the options go up to 90%. The highest is G.0.5% and H.0.02%. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes reflects the efficiency of integration. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient at lysing E. coli, leading to more plumes. The difference between B and K could indicate the level of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nNumber of plumes = N * (1 - R)\n\nWhere N is the number of phages, and R is the recombination rate. If N is the same on both sides, then the ratio of plumes is (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K). But without knowing N, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that recombination affects the probability of lysing each cell. If recombination increases the lysing efficiency, then the expected number of plumes would decrease proportionally.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a 90% chance of retaining its prophage (recombination of 10%), it would cause 90% of the lysogeny, leading to 10% fewer plumes. Hence, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor of 10, matching our observation (40 vs. 4).\n\nThus, recombination would be about 10%, which isn't an option directly. However, looking back at the options, the closest lower value is J.0.05% and I.0.02%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is using the reciprocal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient. Thus, the number of plumes decreases inversely with the efficiency. If the efficiency is 90%, then the number of plumes decreases by 10%. So 40 plumes correspond to 10% efficiency, implying 90% recombination. But again, that's not among the options.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the recombination fraction is calculated based on the ratio of plumes. Let's assume that each lysogenic phage that integrates into the lytic phage contributes 1 + R plumes, whereas without integration, it contributes 1. Then, the average number of plumes per phage would be (N retain)(1 + R) + (N no)(1) ) / N = 1 + (R/N). But without knowing N, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of plumes on B is 10 times that on K, and assuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phages would have been unable to integrate, leading to more plumes. But with recombination, the lysogenic phages integrate, reducing plumes. So, 10 times reduction in plumes could imply a 90% recombination rate.\n\nSince the options don't include 90%, perhaps the intended answer is C.1.5% or B.2%. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the percentage of cells that were lysed.\n\nOn the B side: 40 plumes, so 40 cells lysed.\nOn the K side: 4 plumes, so 4 cells lysed.\n\nTotal cells: Let's assume each culture was plated on 1 million cells. So, for the B side: 40 cells lysed out of 1,000,000, which is 0.004% or 4e-5. For the K side: 4 cells lysed out of 1,000,000, which is 0.004% or 4e-5.\n\nThe difference in recombination can be calculated as (4e-5 - 4e-5)/ (average) \u00d7 100% \u2192 0%. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. The actual recombination would affect the efficiency of lysing, not just the number of cells lysed. So, if the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it becomes more efficient, leading to more lysogeny and more plumes.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into the lytic phage on the B side, reducing the number of plumes by 90%. Thus, the recombination fraction is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the probability of recombination. Suppose that the recombination probability (R) determines the fraction of lysogenic phages that retained their prophage. Then, the efficiency of lysing each cell is proportional to R.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it causes more plumes. The ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrated into the lytic phage on the B side, reducing plumes by 90%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is lower.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are A to G, with G being 0.5% and H 0.02%. Given that my earlier reasoning suggested around 90% recombination, which isn't an option, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination rate is inversely related to the plume density ratio.\n\nIf the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination rate is 90%, but perhaps the intended answer uses log(1/10)=log(0.1)= -2.3, which rounds to 0.02%, corresponding to option H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the base 10 logarithm of the plume density ratio. Log(40/4)=log(10)=1. So, 10^(-1)=0.1, which corresponds to 0.01% recombination, but that's not exactly precise. Alternatively, the change in plume density is a factor of 10, so the recombination rate is log(10)=1, but in terms of recombination fraction, it's e^(-\u0394), where \u0394 is the change in entropy or something else. This line of thought might be too complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the options available, I'll settle on option G.0.5% as the most reasonable choice based on the approximation that recombination reduces the plume density by a factor of 10, corresponding to a 90% recombination rate, but rounding down to the nearest given option. Alternatively, if the correct calculation yields a 0.05% recombination, that would match option J, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

In this case, the effect is seen in the strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage is causing more issues. So maybe the phage's DNA has two regions contributing to its activity\u2014each mutation contributing to the overall effect. \n\nThe test cross ratio might help here. The formula for expected recombinants under linkage would be (p*q)^2 * n, where p and q are the frequencies of the mutations. However, in this case, the observed numbers don't fit that perfectly. On B, you have 40 plumes, and on K, 4. That seems like a significant difference. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to calculate the recombination frequency using the observed data. Since the lysogenic phage is active, the presence of the mutation might indicate that the two mutations are co-influencing the same site on the phage's T4 DNA. The fact that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B suggests that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it more active, while the wild-type phage doesn't. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, then fewer recombined cases should occur. Here, strain B shows more affected cells than K, indicating that the mutation in strain B is more severe, possibly due to recombination from another nearby mutation. \n\nLet me try calculating the expected recombination frequency. Suppose the mutation in strain B contributes R% of the time, and the wild-type contributes W%. If they are linked, the probability of recombination is R*W. But without knowing the exact distribution, maybe we can infer based on the observed numbers. \n\nAlternatively, considering that on B, the number of plumes is much higher, maybe the mutation in B is more common. If strain B has a mutation at a certain rate, and the other strain has another, the chance of recombination could explain why strain B has more issues. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, which means it doesn't lyse the cell. So the mutation must cause it to replicate instead. Maybe the two mutations are located near each other on the phage's T4 DNA. Each mutation may contribute to the activity, and recombination could lead to one being dominant over the other. \n\nIn the first plate, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, leading to half being cleared and half remaining. Then, those remaining were plated on strain K. Only 4 were found there, whereas 40 were on B. This suggests that the mutation in B is more prevalent, and when combined with the K strain, the effect is less pronounced. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, let's consider the ratios. If the mutation in B is R% and the mutation in K is S%, and assuming recombination occurs at a rate of F = R*S, then the probability that a phage carrying both mutations will form a recombinant is F. \n\nGiven the numbers, the ratio of recombinants to non-recombinants might give us an idea. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency from a test cross. \n\nThe test cross ratio is given by (q*r)/(1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction. Alternatively, the formula used in genetic testing often relates to the probability of recombination during gamete formation. \n\nWait, another approach: the number of recombinant offspring (plumes) is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two loci. So if the mutation in B is R% and in K is S%, then the number of recombinants would be approximately (R/S)*n, where n is the total number of offspring. \n\nIn this case, the number of recombinants on K was 4, and on B it was 40. Let's assume that the total number of plumes is roughly the same for both plates. So the ratio of recombinants on K to B would be 4/40 = 1/10. If this ratio equals (S/R), then 1/10 = S/R. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is accurate. Another way is to use the formula for the test cross: (q*r)/(1 - r) \u2248 number of recombinants / (total + number of recombinants). But I'm not confident about this either. \n\nMaybe I should recall that the expected number of recombinant offspring would be (p*q)*(number of trials). If p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations, then the number of recombinants would be around (p*q)*N, where N is the number of cells plated. \n\nIn our case, the number of recombinants on B is 40, and on K is 4.

If the total number of recombinants plus non-recombinants equals N, then the proportion would be (p*q)/((p*q)+(1-p)(1-q)). But I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombinant plumes is inversely related to the product of the mutation rates. So if the number of recombinants is lower on B compared to K, maybe the mutation in B is more common. \n\nAnother thought: since only the lysogenic phage affects B, the mutation must make it so that the lysogenic phage becomes dominant. If the two mutations are linked, one could mask the other, but in this case, the lysogenic phage is still active. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The number of recombinants is lower on B than on K, suggesting that the mutation in B is more common. If the recombination frequency is high, then the number of recombinants would decrease as the number of non-recombinants increases. \n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is F, the number of recombinants would be (F*N), and non-recombinants would be (1-F)*N. So if on B, the number of recombinants is 40 and on K, it's 4, then 40/4 =10 = (F_B / F_K). But I don't know what F_B and F_K are. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the mutation frequencies. So if the mutation in B is R and in K is S, then R*S = 40/(40+4) = ~85.7%. But that doesn't make sense because probabilities can't exceed 100%. \n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the frequency of the mutation. If the mutation in B is more frequent, say 10%, and the mutation in K is 5%, then the recombination frequency would be 0.5%. That matches option J (0.05%) or G (0.5%), depending on rounding. \n\nLooking back at the options: A to E are percentages less than 1%, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, I is 0.02%, J is 0.05%, and others are 0.1%. \n\nSo if the recombination frequency is 0.5%, that's option G. But earlier calculations didn't support this directly. Maybe the correct answer is G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the mutation in B is 0.5% and in K is also 0.5%, then the recombination frequency would indeed be 0.5%. And if the mutation in B is more common, say 1%, then the recombination would be 0.01%, which is too low.

Similarly, 4 on K would mean the phage didn't reach those cells. \n\nHmm, but wait, the initial plate has both mutantphages. So the presence of both might cause some sort of interaction where one mutation helps the other function better. This could be recombination, where the two mutations interact to produce a new effect. In such cases, the probability of successful replication increases. If the two mutations are complementary, meaning they work together, then fewer phages will successfully replicate and lyse the bacteria. Conversely, if they're non-complementary, more phages will lyse, leading to more infections.\n\nIn the experiment, the high number of plumes on B (40) compared to K (4) suggests that the phage from the B half (which was more diluted) had a higher chance of infecting more cells than the K half. Since the K half was less dilute (plated at 1:10^5), maybe it's the opposite\u2014those cells didn't get enough phage to infect as effectively. Alternatively, perhaps the K half contains the lysogenic phage that worked well, while the B half contains the lytic phage that didn't work well. \n\nWait, no, because the lysogenic phage should kill the bacteria without lysis, so if it's in the K half, it should lyse all cells, but the B half has the lytic phage which doesn't lyse. So why did the B half have more plumes? That seems contradictory unless there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions of the genome where the mutations occur interact. For example, if one mutation allows the other to function better, like one mutation providing a partner protein for the other. If that's the case, the overall efficiency of the phage may increase, leading to more plasmid replication. Or, if the mutations interfere, making the phage less effective.\n\nBut according to the results, the B half (with more plumes) shows that the lytic phage didn't lyse any cells, whereas the K half shows that the lysogenic phage did. That seems impossible unless the phages don't interact. Maybe the phages are somehow mixed up, but that wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the regions are interacting in a way that produces a new mutation, but the problem states that the two mutants are already present. So maybe their recombination isn't leading to a new mutation but rather affecting their effectiveness.\n\nLet me think differently. If the two mutations are recombined, their combined effect on replication might be different. Suppose the recombination reduces the likelihood of successful replication, increasing the probability of lysogeny. Then, the presence of both mutations would lead to more efficient replication, causing more plasmids to replicate and lyse, leading to more infections. Alternatively, if the recombination increases the chance of replication, more phages replicate and lyse, but that would reduce the number of plasmids available, possibly leading to less efficient phage activity.\n\nWait, but in our case, the B half showed more plumes, meaning more infections occurred on B. If the two mutations are working together, perhaps their combination leads to increased replication efficiency, resulting in more phages replicating and thus more plasmids available. However, this might depend on whether the phages are lytic or lysogenic.\n\nWait, let me recall the concept of recombination in phages. Recombination refers to the interaction between two phage genes located in the same genome. When two mutations are recombined, it can affect the efficiency of replication. Specifically, if the two mutations are on the same gene, recombination can either enhance or diminish the efficiency of replication depending on the context.\n\nIf the two mutations are recombined, it might create a new gene or change the expression of existing genes. If they enhance replication, then more phages would replicate and lyse, leading to more infections. If they diminish replication, fewer phages would replicate, reducing the number of infections.\n\nIn our experiment, the B half shows more plumes, meaning more infections. If the two mutations are enhancing replication, that would explain why both halves show similar results. Alternatively, if they are recombining in a way that affects their effectiveness, perhaps the lysogenic phage is more effective, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two different phages, the ones that lyse the bacteria without causing lysis are generally more effective. So if the lysogenic phage is more common in the B half, it would lyse more cells, leading to more plumes. But the B half also has the lytic phage, which shouldn't lyse anything. So how come the lysogenic phage is more effective?\n\nPerhaps the presence of both phages somehow causes the lysogenic phage to take over, despite the lytic phage being present. Alternatively, maybe the DNA structure or the environment affects the phage's ability to replicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lytic phage reduces the density of phages in certain regions, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate more efficiently elsewhere. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAnother angle: The difference in dilution (1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5) might indicate the relative concentrations of the two mutantphages. The B half is more diluted, so there are more total phages, including the lysogenic one. The K half is less diluted, so fewer total phages, but more likely to find the lysogenic one.\n\nThe fact that 40 plumes are found on B versus 4 on K suggests that the B half has a higher concentration of phages, and the lysogenic phage is more prevalent there. Therefore, the recombination must be occurring in such a way that the lysogenic phage is more effective in the B half, perhaps due to enhanced replication efficiency caused by recombination.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency is approximately 2 * p * q, assuming independent assortment. But here, we have a scenario where the two mutations interact to affect replication.\n\nGiven that the B half (more plumes) has more phages, and the lysogenic phage is more effective, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect the B cells. If the recombination creates a more efficient lysogenic phage, then the probability of successful replication increases.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of plumes. If the expected number of plumes under normal conditions would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation, then the observed plumes can help us determine the actual recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of their frequencies. Let's denote the frequency of the first mutation as x and the second as y. Then, the expected number of plumes would be k * x * y, where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the data:\n- On B half: 40 plumes.\n- On K half: 4 plumes.\n\nAssuming that the expected number is based on the product of the frequencies, we can set up equations:\n\nFor B half: 40 = k * x * y\nFor K half: 4 = k * x' * y'\n\nBut since the two mutantphages are carrying mutations in the same T_4 genome, their frequencies should be related. Perhaps they are reciprocals of each other, given that they are complementary.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two mutations are interacting, the expected number of plumes would be higher when the recombination is active. So if the recombination frequency is r, the observed plumes would reflect that.\n\nGiven the high number of plumes on B, it suggests that the recombination is occurring in such a way that the lysogenic phage is more effective. To quantify this, we can compare the ratios of plumes between the two halves.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that this ratio reflects the product of the recombination probabilities, we can write:\n\n10 = r_B / r_K\n\nWhere r_B is the recombination probability for the B half, and r_K for the K half.\n\nHowever, if the two mutations are recombined, the recombination probability for each half would depend on their respective environments. But perhaps the recombination rate is the same for both halves, leading to a ratio of 10.\n\nTaking the square root of 10 gives approximately 3.16%, suggesting a recombination frequency of around 3%. But looking at the options provided, the closest is option F (0.3 percent). Wait, but my calculation gave around 3.16%, which is closer to 3%, but none of the options go down to 3%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratios. Let me try again. If the expected number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, then:\n\nOn B half: 40 = k * x * y\nOn K half: 4 = k * x' * y'\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are recombined, perhaps x' = y and y' = x, so the expected number would be the same. But here, the observed numbers differ, so there's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plumes. If the expected number is proportional to the product, then:\n\n(40)/(4) = (x*y)/(x'*y') = r\n\nSo 10 = r\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is 10 times higher. But that doesn't directly translate to a percentage. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = sqrt((Number of recombinants)/(Total number))\n\nBut in our case, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency can be approximated by the ratio of plumes, adjusted for environmental factors.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the presence of recombination increases the number of phages that can lyse the bacteria. If the lysogenic phage is more effective, then the ratio of plumes indicates the degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that the B half has more plumes, and the K half has fewer, it suggests that the B half has more phages, and among those, the lysogenic ones are more effective. Thus, the recombination must be facilitating the lysogenic phage's advantage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nThe expected number of plumes when there is no recombination would be based on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If there is recombination, this changes. Let\u2019s assume that the two mutations are recombined, so the product becomes a different value.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nWithout recombination:\nExpected plumes = k * x * y\n\nWith recombination:\nExpected plumes = k * (x + y) * z\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is simply the ratio of plumes on B to K minus one, multiplied by 100.\n\nSo (40 - 4)/4 = 9/4 = 2.25, which is 225% increase. But that doesn\u2019t fit the options.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of plumes, adjusted for the assumption that the expected number is proportional to the product of the frequencies.\n\nSo, (40)/(4) = 10 = (x * y)/(x' * y') = r\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are recombined, the recombination frequency is 10 times higher. But that still doesn\u2019t match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed Plumes - Expected Plumes) / Expected Plumes\n\nBut I\u2019m getting confused. Let me look for a simpler approach. The key point is that the presence of recombination increases the efficiency of replication, leading to more plasmid replication and thus more plumes. Given that the B half has more plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective there, indicating that the two mutations interact to enhance its activity.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of plumes. If the expected number of plumes without recombination is E, then:\n\nE = k * x * y\n\nAnd with recombination, the observed plumes are O = k * (x + y) * z\n\nBut without knowing the values of x, y, z, this approach isn't feasible. Instead, we can use the ratio of plumes to approximate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 10, which suggests that the recombination is happening 10 times more often than expected by chance. If the two mutations are independent, the expected ratio would be 1:1. So a ratio of 10 implies a significant degree of recombination.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency:\n\nRecombination Frequency = ln(O/E) \u2248 2.3026 * ln(O/E)\n\nHere, O/E = 10, so:\n\nRecombination Frequency \u2248 2.3026 * ln(10) \u2248 2.3026 * 2.3026 \u2248 5.3\n\nThis suggests a recombination frequency of about 5%, which corresponds to option G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the ratio suggested a 10-fold increase, which would correspond to a much higher frequency. However, this approximation might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes (10) indicates that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more efficient. Using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (O/E - 1) / (O/E + 1)\n\nBut this might not be correct. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination probability, the ratio 10 indicates a 10 times higher probability of recombination in the B half than the K half.\n\nSince the total possible recombination is limited by the genome size, we can estimate the frequency as follows:\n\nIf the recombination occurs at a rate of r per generation, the expected number of recombinant events would be higher. But without specific parameters, it's hard to calculate precisely.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option G is 0.5%, which is close to 5%, aligning with the previous approximation. Alternatively, option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%) might be closer to a lower frequency.\n\nBut wait, the ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1, which suggests a significant recombination. Since 5% is an option, and the calculations suggest around 5%, option G (0.5%) might be too low. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C (1.5%), given that the actual calculation might yield a slightly different result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct method is to use the ratio of plumes to estimate the recombination frequency. If the expected number without recombination is E = x * y, and with recombination, O = x' * y', then the ratio O/E gives the multiplicative effect of recombination.\n\nBut I'm stuck. I'll proceed with the estimation that the recombination frequency is around 5%, which is option G (0.5%). However, that seems too low, so perhaps the correct answer is option C (1.5%).\n\nWait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let's recast:\n\nIf the ratio of plumes is 10 (40 vs 4), and this ratio equals the product of the recombination probabilities, then:\n\nr_B / r_K = 10\n\nAssuming that the recombination probability for each half is the same, then:\n\nr_B = 10 * r_K\n\nBut without knowing r_K, this doesn't help. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is the same for both halves, then the ratio remains 10, implying a recombination frequency of about 5%, which is option G (0.5%). But that seems too precise for the given options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C (1.5%).\n\nAfter reconsidering, I think the most reasonable answer based on the ratio of plumes and typical recombination calculations is option C (1.5%).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if 40 are found on B, that means the phage was able to infect 40 cells, right? Similarly, 4 on K would mean the phage didn't reach those cells. \n\nHmm, but wait, the initial plate has both mutantphages. So the presence of both might cause some sort of interaction where one mutation helps the other function better. This could be recombination, where the two mutations interact to produce a new effect. In such cases, the probability of successful replication increases. If the two mutations are complementary, meaning they work together, then fewer phages will successfully replicate and lyse the bacteria. Conversely, if they're non-complementary, more phages will lyse, leading to more infections.\n\nIn the experiment, the high number of plumes on B (40) compared to K (4) suggests that the phage from the B half (which was more diluted) had a higher chance of infecting more cells than the K half. Since the K half was less dilute (plated at 1:10^5), maybe it's the opposite\u2014those cells didn't get enough phage to infect as effectively. Alternatively, perhaps the K half contains the lysogenic phage that worked well, while the B half contains the lytic phage that didn't work well. \n\nWait, no, because the lysogenic phage should kill the bacteria without lysis, so if it's in the K half, it should lyse all cells, but the B half has the lytic phage which doesn't lyse. So why did the B half have more plumes? That seems contradictory unless there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regions of the genome where the mutations occur interact. For example, if one mutation allows the other to function better, like one mutation providing a partner protein for the other. If that's the case, the overall efficiency of the phage may increase, leading to more plasmid replication. Or, if the mutations interfere, making the phage less effective.\n\nBut according to the results, the B half (with more plumes) shows that the lytic phage didn't lyse any cells, whereas the K half shows that the lysogenic phage did. That seems impossible unless the phages don't interact. Maybe the phages are somehow mixed up, but that wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the regions are interacting in a way that produces a new mutation, but the problem states that the two mutants are already present. So maybe their recombination isn't leading to a new mutation but rather affecting their effectiveness.\n\nLet me think differently. If the two mutations are recombined, their combined effect on replication might be different. Suppose the recombination reduces the likelihood of successful replication, increasing the probability of lysogeny. Then, the presence of both mutations would lead to more efficient replication, causing more plasmids to replicate and lyse, leading to more infections. Alternatively, if the recombination increases the chance of replication, more phages replicate and lyse, but that would reduce the number of plasmids available, possibly leading to less efficient phage activity.\n\nWait, but in our case, the B half showed more plumes, meaning more infections occurred on B. If the two mutations are working together, perhaps their combination leads to increased replication efficiency, resulting in more phages replicating and thus more plasmids available. However, this might depend on whether the phages are lytic or lysogenic.\n\nWait, let me recall the concept of recombination in phages. Recombination refers to the interaction between two phage genes located in the same genome. When two mutations are recombined, it can affect the efficiency of replication.

The initial infection with lysogenic phages should kill all E. coli, but since only lysogenic phages cause the issue, the presence of both types might lead to some degree of cross-infection or recombination. However, in reality, lysogenic phages typically integrate their genes into the host genome without causing death, so having both types might lead to some competition for resources, but I'm not sure how that affects recombination directly.\n\nBut according to the problem, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phages are causing the problem, and the presence of lysogenic phages reduces the susceptibility of E. coli B. Therefore, the lysogenic phages must have caused some level of recombination within strain B, leading to lower growth compared to pure lysogenic phages.\n\nNow, the next part says that half the culture is tested on strain B's lawn, and the other half on strain K's lawn. The dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively. After incubation, 4 plumes appeared on strain K, meaning 4 successful infections with strain K's phage. On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes appeared, meaning 40 successful infections with strain B's phage.\n\nPlumes indicate successful infections, so 40 plumes mean 40 phages integrated into strain B's genome. Similarly, 4 plumes mean 4 phages integrated into strain K's genome. Since the total population of each strain is likely large, the density of phages determines the probability of integration.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants (or the chance of recombination) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinants = (number of successful integrations in strain K) \u00d7 (probability of integration per site)\n\nBut wait, I think I need to approach this differently. The key here is to determine the fraction of phages that have integrated into strain B's genome. The success rate is 40/total, where total is the total number of phages tested. Assuming each strain had the same number of phages, say N, then:\n\nFor strain B: 40/N = probability of integration.\n\nSimilarly, for strain K: 4/N = probability of integration.\n\nSince both probabilities should be equal (assuming random integration), we can set them equal:\n\n40/N = 4/N \u2192 which isn't possible unless my assumption is wrong. Wait, that can't be right because the numbers don't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of successful integrations reflects the relative rates of recombination. Since the problem states that the phages are carrying mutations in the same region, the recombination between the two mutations occurs within the phage DNA. However, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, not necessarily the phage DNA.\n\nWait, the problem states that the T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. These mutations are carried by either type of phage. When the phages infect E. coli, they cause lytic fission (if lysogenic) or lysogenic fission (if phage is naturally integrating). In the case of lysogenic phages, the phage DNA integrates into the bacterial genome, allowing them to replicate inside the bacterium and cause lysis upon replication.\n\nSo the presence of lysogenic phages should reduce the susceptibility of the E. coli to lytic fission. The fact that E. coli B is mostly affected by both types of phages suggests that the lysogenic phages (which do not lyse the cell) are reducing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phages (which do lyse the cell). Thus, the lysogenic phages are causing the problem, implying that the lysogenic phages are integrating into the E. coli's genome, thereby increasing their replication inside the cells and reducing the risk of lytic fission.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both types of phages leads to some level of recombination between the two mutations (the lysogenic and phage DNA integration sites) in the T_4 genome. To quantify the recombination, we can use the data provided.\n\nIn the experiment, half the culture was treated with a lysogenic phage (since it doesn't cause lysis) and placed on strain B. The other half was treated with a phage that causes lysis and placed on strain K. However, the results showed that 40% of strain B's colonies were plumed with the lysogenic phage, suggesting that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, making its replication less effective. Conversely, 40% of strain K's colonies were plumed with the phage that caused lysis, indicating that the lysogenic phage did not integrate into strain K's genome.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome but not into strain K's. The presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B led to higher levels of integration (more plumes) in strain B, while the lysogenic phage didn't integrate into strain K. This indicates that the lysogenic phage integrated into the genome of strain B but not into strain K.\n\nThe recombination frequency between the two mutations (lysogenic phage and phage DNA integration) can be estimated from the difference in the number of plumes between the two treatments. Specifically, the proportion of phages that have integrated into the genome is higher in strain B than in strain K. The difference in recombination can be quantified as follows:\n\nRecombination frequency = (Phage on strain B - Phage on strain K) / Total phages\n\nAssuming that the total phages are equally distributed among the two strains, the difference in plumes gives the fraction of phages that have integrated into one strain over the other. Here, strain B received 40 phages integrated, and strain K received 4 phages. Assuming the same total number of phages, let\u2019s denote T as the total number of phages. Then:\n\n(40/T) - (4/T) = 36/T\n\nIf T is very large, this fraction becomes small. However, in practice, the difference in plumes can give us an idea of the recombination rate.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the odds of recombination. The likelihood ratio (LR) is given by the ratio of the probability of observing the data under the hypothesis that there is recombination versus no recombination.\n\nIn this case, the observed data is that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4. Assuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would be the same, but with recombination, one strain would have more plumes than the other. However, since the problem states that strain B is mostly affected by both phages, it implies that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, reducing its replication efficiency. Meanwhile, the lysogenic phage did not integrate into strain K's genome.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can consider the following formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of plumes in strain B - Number of plumes in strain K) / (Total number of plumes + Number of plumes in strain B + Number of plumes in strain K))\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the difference in plumes between the two treatments reflects the difference in integration rates. Since the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B but not into strain K, the recombination frequency is proportional to the difference in plumes.\n\nGiven that strain B received 40 plumes and strain K received 4, the difference is 36. Assuming the total number of plumes is much larger than 36, the fraction of plumes that correspond to recombination is approximately 36/(40+4) \u2248 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. However, this doesn't make sense because recombination would imply that one strain has more integration than the other, but the phage itself is the cause of recombination, not the host.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to realize that the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B reduced the likelihood of recombination, whereas on strain K, there was no change. However, the question asks specifically about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, i.e., the recombination within the T_4 phage DNA.\n\nIn phage experiments, the recombination frequency is often measured by comparing the number of recombinant fusions between two phages. However, in this case, we're dealing with a single locus in the T_4 phage, so the concept applies slightly differently. Recombination frequency here refers to the probability that a phage with a mutation in one gene integrates into a host genome and then integrates another mutation from another phage.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the two types of mutantphages are carrying mutations in the same genomic region (rII), and the result is that when mixed with E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does damage. When split into two groups, one treated with lysogenic phage and the other with phage that causes lysis, the outcomes differ.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- Strain B: 40 plumes (lysogenic phage integrated)\n- Strain K: 4 plumes (lytic phage integrated)\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, but not into strain K's. The recombination frequency would be the fraction of phages that have integrated into one strain over the other. However, since the phages themselves cause recombination within the genome, the actual frequency of recombination events would depend on how many times a phage with a mutation integrated into another phage's DNA.\n\nBut in this scenario, the phages are the ones carrying the mutations. The recombination between the two mutations (mutant in T_4 and lysogenic phage) would occur within the T_4 phage DNA. The number of such events depends on the number of phages that integrated into the T_4 genome.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. These mutations are present in both types of mutantphages. When the T_4 phages infect E. coli, they cause lysogenic fission, leading to lysis upon replication. The presence of lysogenic phages on E. coli strain B suggests that the lysogenic phages are integrating into the T_4 genome, thereby reducing its replication efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency between the lysogenic phage and the T_4 genome can be inferred from the difference in plumes. The lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, resulting in more plumes (40) compared to strain K (4).\n\nThe recombination frequency (Rf) can be approximated by the ratio of plumes:\n\nRf = (plumes in strain B - plumes in strain K) / (total plumes)\n\nAssuming the total plumes are concentrated in the treatment with lysogenic phage, the Rf is approximately (40 - 4)/40 \u2248 96%, which is impossible because recombination cannot exceed 100%.\n\nAlternatively, considering only the additional plumes due to integration, Rf = (40)/(40 + 4) \u2248 81.8%, but this still doesn't align with typical values.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that the recombination frequency is determined by the number of times a mutation integrated into another phage's DNA. However, in this case, the phages are the ones carrying the mutations. Therefore, the recombination frequency within the T_4 phage DNA is determined by the number of phages that have integrated into the T_4 genome.\n\nBut without specific data on the number of phages integrated, we can infer that the presence of lysogenic phages on strain B suggests that the T_4 phage's mutation integrated into the lysogenic phage, thus causing recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing concepts here. The problem states that the two types of mutantphages are carrying mutations in the same genomic region (T_4). When both types are present, only the lysogenic phage does damage to E. coli strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage is causing the problem, so it must have integrated into the E. coli's genome, thereby reducing the replication efficiency.\n\nThus, the recombination between the lysogenic phage and the T_4 phage occurs within the T_4 phage, and the frequency can be determined by the difference in plumes. Since the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, the plumes from strain B show higher integration. The recombination frequency would reflect how often the T_4 phage's mutation combined with the lysogenic phage's mutation occurred.\n\nHowever, without specific data on the number of phages integrated, we can only infer the direction of integration. The lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, so the recombination frequency is higher in strain B than in strain K.\n\nBut the question is asking for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Since the T_4 phages carry the mutations, the recombination within the T_4 phage is what's being sought. However, in phage experiments, recombination between two phages is typically assessed by measuring the number of recombinant fuses formed when two phages exchange genetic material. But in this case, it's a single locus in the T_4 phage.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the recombination frequency within the T_4 phage genome itself. That is, how often a T_4 phage with mutation A integrated into another T_4 phage with mutation B. Without specific data on the number of such combinations, we can only infer that the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that some recombination occurred.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, the recombination frequency would be higher in strain B than in strain K. However, the problem provides options for recombination frequencies, and we need to choose the closest one.\n\nLooking back, the options are percentages like 1%, 2%, etc. Given that the lysogenic phage integrated into strain B's genome, the recombination frequency would be high. However, the exact calculation requires knowing the number of integration events.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrated into the T_4 phage once, the recombination frequency would be low. But if it integrated multiple times, the frequency would increase. However, without specific data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The difference in plumes (36) across the two treatments suggests that 36 phages integrated into strain B's genome compared to 4 into strain K's. The total number of phages treated is 40 + 4 = 44. So the fraction of phages that integrated into strain B is 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. However, this doesn't relate directly to the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the percentage of phages that have integrated into both strains.

However, the exact value depends on how many times the phage integrated into the genome.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is B. 2 percent.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have four plumes on strain K, that means four new phages were successfully integrated into K's genome. Similarly, fourty plumes on strain B would be 40 successful infections, indicating more integration into B's genome.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in phage experiments, a plume usually refers to a single successful infection event. If the bacteria has been lysed, they won't form colonies, so the number of plumes corresponds to the number of colonies. But wait, here we're looking at the effect on different strains. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the way the results are interpreted is that if a mutation from one phage integrates with another, the likelihood of the offspring being susceptible increases. But in this case, the presence of multiple phages could lead to increased recombination.\n\nLet me think again.

Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different genes within the same organism. In this case, we're dealing with two mutations in the same T_4 phage, leading to different outcomes when mixed with E. coli strains. So the presence of both mutantphages might cause a change in how they interact with the host, possibly through recombination.\n\nThe key here is to determine how many times the two mutations have combined during the replication process. Each mutation is likely a point mutation causing either lysogenic or non-lysogenic behavior. If they recombine, it could lead to a new type of phage, such as a phage that integrates another gene from the other mutation.\n\nThe way to calculate recombination frequency is often using the formula for interference or using binomial coefficients. However, in this context, the number of plasmid fusions or recombinases would give us an idea. Since the result shows more plumes on B (40 vs. 4), maybe the recombination occurred less frequently than expected, meaning fewer combinations happened.\n\nWait, perhaps the plume count relates directly to the number of recombinants. Each time a recombination occurs, it increases the likelihood of certain events. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the probability of recombining would be p*q, where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. But without knowing p and q individually, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors: one half was plated at 1:10^7, and the other at 1:10^5. If recombination happens more frequently, perhaps the outcome depends on the combination of these dilutions. The higher dilution (1:10^7) would reduce the chance of recombination because there's less chance for the mutations to combine before the phage replicates.\n\nGiven that 40 plumes appear on strain B, which has more plumes than K, perhaps recombination hasn't happened as much as expected. The difference in plume counts might indicate the number of times the two mutations co-existed. If the maximum possible is 100, then 40 on B suggests that 60 didn't recombine. This could imply that the recombination rate is lower than expected.\n\nTo find the percentage, let's consider that the total possible combinations are 100. If 60 didn't recombine, the recombination frequency is 60%. But wait, the options don't include 60%, so maybe it's related inversely.

That seems too small, so perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the ratio of plumes gives an indication of the recombination. If 40 on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. Perhaps this corresponds to the ratio of recombined to unrecombined phages. So if 9 parts are unrecombined and 1 part is recombined, that's 11 parts total. Then the recombination frequency would be approximately 1/11, which is around 9%, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination leads to a particular outcome, like increased susceptibility, the observed plume numbers might reflect the number of recombinants. Given that 40 on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination is minimal, suggesting a very low percentage.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option C is 1.5 percent, which seems plausible but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is to use the formula for recombination frequency f = (1 - e^{-2p}), assuming two independent loci. But without knowing p, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the relative intensity of the effect. Since 40 on B is four times as many as 4 on K, maybe the recombination is happening once every four trials, leading to a frequency of 25% per trial, which isn't matching any option.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. If the two mutants cause different behaviors when mixed, the recombination must occur enough to make the effects consistent across the population. The fact that 40 on B and 4 on K suggests that the recombination happened 8 times more often on B, indicating a higher recombination rate. But again, none of the options match 8%.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinants. If 40 on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. Assuming each plume represents a single occurrence, then the recombination rate is 10/(10+1)=~90.9%, which is close to 100%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination could be calculated as (number of recombined)/(total). If 40 on B and 4 on K, the total is 44. Recombined is 40, so 40/44\u224890.9%, still not matching any option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that the two mutants cause different outcomes when mixed. The plume counts suggest that recombination occurred less frequently, resulting in fewer infections. If the majority of the plumes on B correspond to recombinations, then perhaps the recombination rate is low. Among the options, 0.05% (option E) is very low, which might fit if recombination happened rarely.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful recombined events. If each recombination event produces a new phage, the higher the number of recombined events, the more susceptible the host becomes. So 40 on B and 4 on K implies that recombination occurred 8 times more often on B compared to K. If K had minimal recombination, the high number on B suggests moderate recombination.

For example, if two mutations are linked and occur independently in the population, you might see more recombinant events than expected under independence.\n\nIn this case, the first half is plated on strain B's lawn, and the second on strain K's. The number of plumes on each depends on whether the phage is compatible with the host. If a mutation is in the same region as another and they're linked, it could affect the outcome.

Strain K was presumably the lysogenic phage, so if any plumes were seen on strain K, that indicates the lysogenic phage wasn't effective against strain B, possibly due to recombination or a change in compatibility.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage was effective against strain K, then why weren't there any plumes? That seems unlikely unless there's a mutation affecting its ability to infect strain K.

So, if the recombination frequency is high, you'd expect more recombinants, but in this case, the numbers don't directly show that. Instead, the ratio of plumes suggests a certain level of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes under independent assortment versus linked.

    "rollout": " So 40 on B mean 40 phages have entered the E. coli, while 4 on K mean fewer. \n\nHmm, the main idea here is about how these mutations affect each other. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions or molecules within the same genome. In phages, especially T_4, there's usually a specific recombination point where the lysogenic and lytic parts come together. If you have two mutations, say at positions X and Y, their combination might cause new functional outcomes depending on whether they're active together.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing any issues, so maybe its mutation isn't contributing anything beyond what's already present. But wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII that cause lytic fission. So if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing, then it would lyse the E. coli. However, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage isn't causing any damage, meaning perhaps its mutation isn't functional. Or maybe it's a neutral mutation that doesn't affect replication. But why would that be the case? Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that makes it more efficient, allowing it to replicate better, but that seems less likely given the results.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The problem mentions that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII that cause lytic fission but don't cause the lyosis observed in strain B. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation isn't causing a problem, implying that perhaps it doesn't contribute to the lytic outcome. Therefore, the recombination must be happening elsewhere, perhaps between the lysogenic phage and another region or within itself.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both types of phages are present, only half of the cells are damaged when plated on strain B. This indicates that the lysogenic phage isn't causing the issue, so perhaps its mutation doesn't interfere with replication. On the other hand, when the other half is plated on strain K, only four are damaged, whereas when plated on B, 40 are. Wait, no\u2014the other half is plated on strain K, so when it was originally split, the first half (plated on B) had 40 plumes, and the second half (plated on K) had 4 plumes. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's about the number of plumes and dilution factors affecting the probability of infection.\n\nSo, when both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage shouldn't affect the outcome much because it doesn't lyse the E. coli. Therefore, the lysogenic phage's mutation might be irrelevant, and the effect comes from the lysogenic phage's own replication. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation is masking the lysogenic behavior, making it appear as though it's replicating successfully, hence causing the issue when it shouldn't. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lyosis, but the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to survive better, so when both types are present, the lysogenic phage's mutation might lead to higher survival rates, thereby reducing the number of successful infections on strain B. But according to the data, when both are present, half the cells are damaged on B, and only four on K. Since the other half was on K, which should have been less damaged, but it wasn't. Wait, no\u2014when both types are present, the cells are divided into two groups: one group with lower dilution (1:10^7) and one with higher dilution (1:10^5). Each group is plated on a different lawn. The low-dilution group (plated on B) resulted in 40 plumes, suggesting many infections, whereas the high-dilution group (plated on K) resulted in only 4 plumes. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage is being replicated efficiently due to its mutation, then in the high-dilution group (plated on K), even a small number of infections could cause issues, but in the low-dilution group (plated on B), the phage's mutation wouldn't allow enough replication to cause significant damage. Therefore, the difference in the number of plumes supports the idea that the lysogenic phage's mutation enhances its replication efficiency, leading to more successful infections in the high-dilution condition.\n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lyosis, its mutation might not interfere with replication. However, the fact that the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to increased replication efficiency suggests that it's part of the phage's structure, possibly a recombination site within the T_4 DNA. \n\nRecombination in phages often occurs at specific sites, like rII for T_4. If there's a mutation in rII, it could either enhance or reduce the replication efficiency. Here, the lysogenic phage's mutation enhances replication, indicating that it's a recombination site that increases activity. \n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total offspring) * 100%\n\nBut in this context, the numbers given relate to the probabilities of infection. The high-dilution group (plated on K) showed fewer plumes, suggesting lower probability of infection compared to the low-dilution group (plated on B). The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This implies that the probability of infection is ten times higher in the low-dilution group than the high-dilution group. \n\nSince the probability is inversely related to the dilution factor, the expected probability of infection without recombination would be proportional to the square root of the dilution factor. Wait, that's a bit fuzzy. Let me recall: the probability of a mutation surviving in a population under selection can be modeled using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. If the mutation rate is 'p', the probability of an individual carrying two copies of the mutated allele (homozygous) is p\u00b2, carrying one copy is 2pq, and homozygous non-mutation is q\u00b2. If the mutation increases fitness, the frequency of the mutated allele increases, but in our case, the presence of the mutation leads to increased replication efficiency, so it might act as a modifier rather than a dominant advantage.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, the increase in replication efficiency due to the lysogenic phage's mutation reduces the probability of infection in the high-dilution group. Since the probability decreases by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), and the dilution factors are 10^7 and 10^5, respectively, the relationship between recombination and probability change can be derived.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as 'c'. When there is recombination, the probability of a double mutant allele (both mutated) is c * q * r, assuming independent recombination events. But in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation. Wait, perhaps it's simpler: if the mutation increases the replication efficiency, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is reduced by a factor of 100 (from 40 to 4, which is 1/10th). \n\nAssuming that the increase in replication efficiency directly affects the probability of infection, and that the recombination fraction determines the probability, we can model the probability change. Let's assume that the presence of the mutation in the lysogenic phage increases the probability of replication by a certain factor. Let\u2019s call this factor 'k'. Then, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group would be P_high = k * P_low, where P_low is the probability in the low-dilution group.\n\nGiven that P_high = 40/Total_plumes and P_low = 4/Total_plumes, but since the total plumes per group vary, perhaps it's better to consider the relative probabilities. The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1. Assuming that the probability of infection is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, because lower dilution means higher concentration of phage, so higher chance of infection.\n\nTherefore, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group. Let's express this mathematically. Let P_low be the probability in the low-dilution group, and P_high = 10 * P_low.\n\nFrom the Hardy-Weinberg perspective, if the mutation increases replication efficiency, the frequency of the mutated allele increases. However, in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation in the T_4 genome. Perhaps the recombination frequency relates to the likelihood of the mutation causing a change in the replication process.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the relationship between recombination frequency and the coefficient of coincidence. Coefficient of coincidence (COC) measures the correlation between the occurrence of two loci. For a double mutant, COC = (observed double mutants) / (expected double mutants). But in this case, we have monoallelic mutations, so perhaps it's more relevant to the concept of interference.\n\nBut maybe a simpler way is to use the formula for the probability of recombination. Suppose that the recombination frequency is 'c', and the mutation rate in each gamete is 'm'. Then, the probability of recombining two alleles is approximately 'c' multiplied by 'm'. However, since we're dealing with a single mutation, perhaps the formula simplifies.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the number of plumes indicates the probability of infection. Since the high-dilution group (plated on K) has only 4 plumes, and the low-dilution group (plated on B) has 40, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the probability of infection is 10 times higher in the high-dilution group. \n\nIf the mutation in the lysogenic phage enhances replication efficiency, the probability of infection depends on the ability of the phage to replicate. Let's assume that without recombination, the probability of infection is 'p'. With recombination, the probability becomes 'p + c*(1-p)', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if recombination increases the probability, then 'p' could be the original probability, and with recombination, it becomes 'p + c'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the probabilities directly. Let\u2019s define the probability of recombination as 'c'. The probability of a phage carrying the mutation in the T_4 genome is 'c', and the mutation increases the replication efficiency, thus increasing the probability of infection.\n\nIf the mutation in the lysogenic phage increases the replication efficiency, then the probability of infection in the high-dilution group (K) is higher than in the low-dilution group (B). Specifically, the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1. Therefore, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the probability of infection in the low-dilution group is 'q'. Then, the probability in the high-dilution group is '10q'. Now, we need to relate this to the recombination frequency 'c'.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the probability of infection would be 'q'. With recombination, the probability increases. The exact relationship depends on whether recombination acts to enhance or reduce replication. If recombination enhances replication, then the increase in probability is due to recombination. Conversely, if recombination reduces replication, the probability would decrease.\n\nIn our case, the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to increased replication efficiency, so recombination contributes to this enhancement. Therefore, the increase in probability is due to recombination. \n\nThe increase in probability can be modeled as follows: the original probability is 'q', and with recombination, it becomes 'q + c*q', where 'c' is the recombination frequency (a value between 0 and 1). Alternatively, if the mutation increases the probability multiplicatively, it could be 'q * (1 + c)'.\n\nBut in reality, the increase in probability is not necessarily additive; instead, it's a multiplicative effect. The correct approach is to recognize that the increase in replication efficiency leads to a higher probability of infection. \n\nGiven that the probability in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group, we can set up the equation:\n\nProbability_high = Probability_low * 10\n\nAssuming that the probability increases linearly with recombination frequency, we can write:\n\nq_high = q_low * 10\n\nHowever, this assumes that the increase in probability is uniform across all possible recombination frequencies. A better approach is to use the concept of the coefficient of coincidence, but since we have a single mutation, it's more about the recombination frequency affecting the probability.\n\nThe relationship between recombination frequency and the probability of recombination can be approximated as:\n\np = c\n\nwhere 'p' is the probability of recombination. However, in our case, the increase in probability is not straightforward. Instead, the increase in replication efficiency due to recombination leads to a higher probability of infection.\n\nAssuming that the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group, and knowing that the probability is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, we can calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Dilution factor for low-dilution group (plated on B): D_low = 10^7\n- Dilution factor for high-dilution group (plated on K): D_high = 10^5\n- Probability of infection in low-dilution group: P_low\n- Probability of infection in high-dilution group: P_high = 10 * P_low\n\nUnder the assumption that the probability of infection is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, we have:\n\nP_low \u221d 1/D_low => P_low = k/D_low\nP_high \u221d 1/D_high => P_high = k/D_high\n\nWhere 'k' is a constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven that P_high = 10 * P_low,\n\n(k/D_high) = 10*(k/D_low)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/D_high = 10/D_low\n\n=> D_high = D_low / 10\n\nWhich matches the given dilution factors: D_high = 10^5, D_low = 10^7, and indeed, 10^5 = 10^7 / 10.\n\nThis confirms our initial assumption that P_high = 10 * P_low holds true based on the dilution factors.\n\nNow, relating this to recombination frequency. The increase in probability can be expressed as:\n\nP_high = P_low * (1 + c)\n\nWhere 'c' is the recombination frequency (a value between 0 and 1).\n\nSubstituting P_high = 10 * P_low,\n\n10 * P_low = P_low * (1 + c)\n\nDivide both sides by P_low (assuming P_low \u2260 0),\n\n10 = 1 + c\n\nThus,\n\nc = 9\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because recombination frequencies typically range between 0 and 1, not 9. Clearly, I made a mistake in the model.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the probability of recombination (c) is proportional to the increase in replication efficiency. Since the increase in replication efficiency is multiplicative, the probability of recombination is also multiplicative. Thus, the increase factor can be represented as:\n\nP_high = P_low * e^{c}\n\nBut this complicates things further. Alternatively, let's think in terms of the coefficient of coincidence, but since we're dealing with a single mutation, it's probably simpler to realize that the recombination frequency corresponds to the change in the probability of infection.\n\nGiven that the probability increases by a factor of 10 when recombination occurs, the recombination frequency is such that the probability of recombination (c) leads to this increase. If the increase in probability is due to recombination, then the increase factor is equal to 1 + c. Therefore,\n\n1 + c = 10\n\n=> c = 9\n\nAgain, this gives c = 9, which is impossible because c cannot exceed 1. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be incorrect.\n\nInstead, let's consider that the increase in probability is due to the presence of recombination. The probability of the lysogenic phage replicating is enhanced by recombination. The probability of replication without recombination might be 'q', and with recombination, it becomes 'q + c', where 'c' is the recombination frequency. However, since recombination can occur anywhere in the genome, the actual increase in replication efficiency is determined by the recombination frequency.\n\nIn this context, the increase in probability (\u0394P) caused by recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394P \u2248 (c) * (probability without recombination)\n\nBut without knowing the base probability, it's challenging to compute directly. However, since the increase in probability is 9 times (from 1% to 100%), the recombination frequency must correspond to this.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the highest option is F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. However, this seems too low given that the probability increased by a factor of 10. Another approach is to consider that the probability of recombination (c) is proportional to the increase in replication efficiency. If the increase is a factor of 10, then c \u2248 1/10, which is 0.1%.\n\nLooking at the options, G.0.5% and H.5% seem plausible, but 0.1% is closer to 0.02% (option A) or 0.05% (option B). However, none of these match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is linked to the logarithmic scale of the probability change.\n\nThe increase in probability is log(10) \u2248 2.3, so if the recombination frequency is such that ln(c) \u2248 -2.3, then c \u2248 e^{-2.3} \u2248 0.1, which corresponds to option A (0.02%) or B (0.05%). However, this line of reasoning is speculative and might not be accurate.\n\nGiven the confusion and the limited information, I'll proceed with the most reasonable estimate. The increase in probability by a factor of 10 suggests that the recombination frequency is around 0.05% (Option B), as this aligns with typical recombination frequencies in bacterial genomes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 on B mean 40 phages have entered the E. coli, while 4 on K mean fewer. \n\nHmm, the main idea here is about how these mutations affect each other. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions or molecules within the same genome. In phages, especially T_4, there's usually a specific recombination point where the lysogenic and lytic parts come together. If you have two mutations, say at positions X and Y, their combination might cause new functional outcomes depending on whether they're active together.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing any issues, so maybe its mutation isn't contributing anything beyond what's already present. But wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII that cause lytic fission. So if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing, then it would lyse the E. coli. However, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage isn't causing any damage, meaning perhaps its mutation isn't functional. Or maybe it's a neutral mutation that doesn't affect replication. But why would that be the case? Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that makes it more efficient, allowing it to replicate better, but that seems less likely given the results.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The problem mentions that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII that cause lytic fission but don't cause the lyosis observed in strain B. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation isn't causing a problem, implying that perhaps it doesn't contribute to the lytic outcome. Therefore, the recombination must be happening elsewhere, perhaps between the lysogenic phage and another region or within itself.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both types of phages are present, only half of the cells are damaged when plated on strain B. This indicates that the lysogenic phage isn't causing the issue, so perhaps its mutation doesn't interfere with replication. On the other hand, when the other half is plated on strain K, only four are damaged, whereas when plated on B, 40 are. Wait, no\u2014the other half is plated on strain K, so when it was originally split, the first half (plated on B) had 40 plumes, and the second half (plated on K) had 4 plumes. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's about the number of plumes and dilution factors affecting the probability of infection.\n\nSo, when both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage shouldn't affect the outcome much because it doesn't lyse the E. coli. Therefore, the lysogenic phage's mutation might be irrelevant, and the effect comes from the lysogenic phage's own replication. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation is masking the lysogenic behavior, making it appear as though it's replicating successfully, hence causing the issue when it shouldn't. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lyosis, but the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to survive better, so when both types are present, the lysogenic phage's mutation might lead to higher survival rates, thereby reducing the number of successful infections on strain B. But according to the data, when both are present, half the cells are damaged on B, and only four on K. Since the other half was on K, which should have been less damaged, but it wasn't. Wait, no\u2014when both types are present, the cells are divided into two groups: one group with lower dilution (1:10^7) and one with higher dilution (1:10^5). Each group is plated on a different lawn. The low-dilution group (plated on B) resulted in 40 plumes, suggesting many infections, whereas the high-dilution group (plated on K) resulted in only 4 plumes. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage is being replicated efficiently due to its mutation, then in the high-dilution group (plated on K), even a small number of infections could cause issues, but in the low-dilution group (plated on B), the phage's mutation wouldn't allow enough replication to cause significant damage. Therefore, the difference in the number of plumes supports the idea that the lysogenic phage's mutation enhances its replication efficiency, leading to more successful infections in the high-dilution condition.\n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lyosis, its mutation might not interfere with replication. However, the fact that the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to increased replication efficiency suggests that it's part of the phage's structure, possibly a recombination site within the T_4 DNA. \n\nRecombination in phages often occurs at specific sites, like rII for T_4. If there's a mutation in rII, it could either enhance or reduce the replication efficiency. Here, the lysogenic phage's mutation enhances replication, indicating that it's a recombination site that increases activity. \n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total offspring) * 100%\n\nBut in this context, the numbers given relate to the probabilities of infection. The high-dilution group (plated on K) showed fewer plumes, suggesting lower probability of infection compared to the low-dilution group (plated on B). The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This implies that the probability of infection is ten times higher in the low-dilution group than the high-dilution group. \n\nSince the probability is inversely related to the dilution factor, the expected probability of infection without recombination would be proportional to the square root of the dilution factor. Wait, that's a bit fuzzy. Let me recall: the probability of a mutation surviving in a population under selection can be modeled using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. If the mutation rate is 'p', the probability of an individual carrying two copies of the mutated allele (homozygous) is p\u00b2, carrying one copy is 2pq, and homozygous non-mutation is q\u00b2. If the mutation increases fitness, the frequency of the mutated allele increases, but in our case, the presence of the mutation leads to increased replication efficiency, so it might act as a modifier rather than a dominant advantage.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, the increase in replication efficiency due to the lysogenic phage's mutation reduces the probability of infection in the high-dilution group. Since the probability decreases by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), and the dilution factors are 10^7 and 10^5, respectively, the relationship between recombination and probability change can be derived.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as 'c'. When there is recombination, the probability of a double mutant allele (both mutated) is c * q * r, assuming independent recombination events. But in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation. Wait, perhaps it's simpler: if the mutation increases the replication efficiency, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is reduced by a factor of 100 (from 40 to 4, which is 1/10th). \n\nAssuming that the increase in replication efficiency directly affects the probability of infection, and that the recombination fraction determines the probability, we can model the probability change. Let's assume that the presence of the mutation in the lysogenic phage increases the probability of replication by a certain factor. Let\u2019s call this factor 'k'. Then, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group would be P_high = k * P_low, where P_low is the probability in the low-dilution group.\n\nGiven that P_high = 40/Total_plumes and P_low = 4/Total_plumes, but since the total plumes per group vary, perhaps it's better to consider the relative probabilities. The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1. Assuming that the probability of infection is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, because lower dilution means higher concentration of phage, so higher chance of infection.\n\nTherefore, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group. Let's express this mathematically. Let P_low be the probability in the low-dilution group, and P_high = 10 * P_low.\n\nFrom the Hardy-Weinberg perspective, if the mutation increases replication efficiency, the frequency of the mutated allele increases. However, in this case, we're dealing with a single mutation in the T_4 genome. Perhaps the recombination frequency relates to the likelihood of the mutation causing a change in the replication process.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the relationship between recombination frequency and the coefficient of coincidence. Coefficient of coincidence (COC) measures the correlation between the occurrence of two loci. For a double mutant, COC = (observed double mutants) / (expected double mutants). But in this case, we have monoallelic mutations, so perhaps it's more relevant to the concept of interference.\n\nBut maybe a simpler way is to use the formula for the probability of recombination. Suppose that the recombination frequency is 'c', and the mutation rate in each gamete is 'm'. Then, the probability of recombining two alleles is approximately 'c' multiplied by 'm'. However, since we're dealing with a single mutation, perhaps the formula simplifies.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the number of plumes indicates the probability of infection. Since the high-dilution group (plated on K) has only 4 plumes, and the low-dilution group (plated on B) has 40, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the probability of infection is 10 times higher in the high-dilution group. \n\nIf the mutation in the lysogenic phage enhances replication efficiency, the probability of infection depends on the ability of the phage to replicate. Let's assume that without recombination, the probability of infection is 'p'. With recombination, the probability becomes 'p + c*(1-p)', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if recombination increases the probability, then 'p' could be the original probability, and with recombination, it becomes 'p + c'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the probabilities directly. Let\u2019s define the probability of recombination as 'c'. The probability of a phage carrying the mutation in the T_4 genome is 'c', and the mutation increases the replication efficiency, thus increasing the probability of infection.\n\nIf the mutation in the lysogenic phage increases the replication efficiency, then the probability of infection in the high-dilution group (K) is higher than in the low-dilution group (B). Specifically, the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1. Therefore, the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the probability of infection in the low-dilution group is 'q'. Then, the probability in the high-dilution group is '10q'. Now, we need to relate this to the recombination frequency 'c'.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the probability of infection would be 'q'. With recombination, the probability increases. The exact relationship depends on whether recombination acts to enhance or reduce replication. If recombination enhances replication, then the increase in probability is due to recombination. Conversely, if recombination reduces replication, the probability would decrease.\n\nIn our case, the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to increased replication efficiency, so recombination contributes to this enhancement. Therefore, the increase in probability is due to recombination. \n\nThe increase in probability can be modeled as follows: the original probability is 'q', and with recombination, it becomes 'q + c*q', where 'c' is the recombination frequency (a value between 0 and 1). Alternatively, if the mutation increases the probability multiplicatively, it could be 'q * (1 + c)'.\n\nBut in reality, the increase in probability is not necessarily additive; instead, it's a multiplicative effect. The correct approach is to recognize that the increase in replication efficiency leads to a higher probability of infection. \n\nGiven that the probability in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group, we can set up the equation:\n\nProbability_high = Probability_low * 10\n\nAssuming that the probability increases linearly with recombination frequency, we can write:\n\nq_high = q_low * 10\n\nHowever, this assumes that the increase in probability is uniform across all possible recombination frequencies. A better approach is to use the concept of the coefficient of coincidence, but since we have a single mutation, it's more about the recombination frequency affecting the probability.\n\nThe relationship between recombination frequency and the probability of recombination can be approximated as:\n\np = c\n\nwhere 'p' is the probability of recombination. However, in our case, the increase in probability is not straightforward. Instead, the increase in replication efficiency due to recombination leads to a higher probability of infection.\n\nAssuming that the probability of infection in the high-dilution group is 10 times higher than in the low-dilution group, and knowing that the probability is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, we can calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Dilution factor for low-dilution group (plated on B): D_low = 10^7\n- Dilution factor for high-dilution group (plated on K): D_high = 10^5\n- Probability of infection in low-dilution group: P_low\n- Probability of infection in high-dilution group: P_high = 10 * P_low\n\nUnder the assumption that the probability of infection is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, we have:\n\nP_low \u221d 1/D_low => P_low = k/D_low\nP_high \u221d 1/D_high => P_high = k/D_high\n\nWhere 'k' is a constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven that P_high = 10 * P_low,\n\n(k/D_high) = 10*(k/D_low)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/D_high = 10/D_low\n\n=> D_high = D_low / 10\n\nWhich matches the given dilution factors: D_high = 10^5, D_low = 10^7, and indeed, 10^5 = 10^7 / 10.\n\nThis confirms our initial assumption that P_high = 10 * P_low holds true based on the dilution factors.\n\nNow, relating this to recombination frequency. The increase in probability can be expressed as:\n\nP_high = P_low * (1 + c)\n\nWhere 'c' is the recombination frequency (a value between 0 and 1).\n\nSubstituting P_high = 10 * P_low,\n\n10 * P_low = P_low * (1 + c)\n\nDivide both sides by P_low (assuming P_low \u2260 0),\n\n10 = 1 + c\n\nThus,\n\nc = 9\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because recombination frequencies typically range between 0 and 1, not 9. Clearly, I made a mistake in the model.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the probability of recombination (c) is proportional to the increase in replication efficiency. Since the increase in replication efficiency is multiplicative, the probability of recombination is also multiplicative. Thus, the increase factor can be represented as:\n\nP_high = P_low * e^{c}\n\nBut this complicates things further. Alternatively, let's think in terms of the coefficient of coincidence, but since we're dealing with a single mutation, it's probably simpler to realize that the recombination frequency corresponds to the change in the probability of infection.\n\nGiven that the probability increases by a factor of 10 when recombination occurs, the recombination frequency is such that the probability of recombination (c) leads to this increase. If the increase in probability is due to recombination, then the increase factor is equal to 1 + c. Therefore,\n\n1 + c = 10\n\n=> c = 9\n\nAgain, this gives c = 9, which is impossible because c cannot exceed 1. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be incorrect.\n\nInstead, let's consider that the increase in probability is due to the presence of recombination. The probability of the lysogenic phage replicating is enhanced by recombination. The probability of replication without recombination might be 'q', and with recombination, it becomes 'q + c', where 'c' is the recombination frequency. However, since recombination can occur anywhere in the genome, the actual increase in replication efficiency is determined by the recombination frequency.\n\nIn this context, the increase in probability (\u0394P) caused by recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394P \u2248 (c) * (probability without recombination)\n\nBut without knowing the base probability, it's challenging to compute directly. However, since the increase in probability is 9 times (from 1% to 100%), the recombination frequency must correspond to this.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the highest option is F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. However, this seems too low given that the probability increased by a factor of 10. Another approach is to consider that the probability of recombination (c) is proportional to the increase in replication efficiency. If the increase is a factor of 10, then c \u2248 1/10, which is 0.1%.\n\nLooking at the options, G.0.5% and H.5% seem plausible, but 0.1% is closer to 0.02% (option A) or 0.05% (option B). However, none of these match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is linked to the logarithmic scale of the probability change.\n\nThe increase in probability is log(10) \u2248 2.3, so if the recombination frequency is such that ln(c) \u2248 -2.3, then c \u2248 e^{-2.3} \u2248 0.1, which corresponds to option A (0.02%) or B (0.05%). However, this line of reasoning is speculative and might not be accurate.\n\nGiven the confusion and the limited information, I'll proceed with the most reasonable estimate. The increase in probability by a factor of 10 suggests that the recombination frequency is around 0.05% (Option B), as this aligns with typical recombination frequencies in bacterial genomes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So four plumes mean four successful infections, meaning four phages have integrated into the bacterial chromosome.",
    "rollout": " So four plumes mean four successful infections, meaning four phages have integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nNow, when you plate the lysogenic phages (which cause lysogeny) on a strain B lawn, you expect fewer plumes than if they were on strain K. If the phages had no recombination, they would all integrate into strain B's chromosome, leading to more successful infections and more plumes. However, here we see that when lysogenic phages are plated on strain B, they don't get as many plumes as when they're plated on strain K. This indicates that some integration has happened between the two mutants\u2014so the recombination rate must be low enough that most phages don't integrate into strain B, allowing them to infect strain B successfully, while the lysogenic phages (which don't integrate into strain B) also infect strain B.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant plumes is N = (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are the numbers of each type of phage. Here, n1 is the lysogenic phages (plated on strain B) at 1:10^7 dilution, and n2 is the lysogenic phages (plated on strain K) at 1:10^5 dilution. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is to consider the proportion of each type. Alternatively, another way is to calculate the probability that a phage integrates into a specific host and then use that to find the expected number of plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the recombination rate R. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes is given by:\n\nExpected plumes = (n1 * n2) / (N_total)\n\nWhere:\n- n1 is the number of lysogenic phages plated on strain B.\n- n2 is the number of lysogenic phages plated on strain K.\n- N_total is the total number of phages.\n\nBut wait, actually, each phage is present at different concentrations. Since n1 is 1:10^7 and n2 is 1:10^5, their concentrations are different. To compare, let's express them in terms of number per mL. Let\u2019s assume equal volumes for simplicity. Then n1 = 1e-7 and n2 = 1e-5.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants (recombined phages) would be proportional to (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2). Plugging in the values:\n\n(1e-7 * 1e-5) / (1e-7 + 1e-5) = (1e-12) / (1.01e-5) \u2248 9.9e-8.\n\nThis is very small, which suggests low recombination. Now, how does this relate to the observed plumes? Each recombinant phage will lead to a successful infection on the respective host, contributing to the plume count.\n\nIn our case, when lysogenic phages (from strain B) are plated on strain B, they should integrate into strain B with recombination rate R, leading to some successful infections. Similarly, when lysogenic phages from strain K are plated on strain B, they won't integrate into B, so all their infections will be non-recombinant. \n\nThe observed plumes are 4 on K and 40 on B. Assuming the same volume, the ratio of plumes is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That suggests that the probability of integration is lower on the K side compared to B. Wait, but the lysogenic phages from K shouldn't integrate into B, so they should all infect B successfully. On the B side, some phages integrate into B, leading to some successful infections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to determine how much of the lysogenic phages integrate into the host. The presence of some plumes on B despite no recombination implies that some phages did integrate into B. Conversely, when they're plated on K, they don't integrate into B, so they all infect B.\n\nSo, the fraction of lysogenic phages that integrate into B is the recombination rate R. Let's denote the number of lysogenic phages as n_B (on strain B) and n_K (on strain K).\n\nWhen n_B is plated on B, the expected number of successful infections (plumes) is n_B * (1 - R). Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, the expected number is n_K * (1 - R). However, in our case, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40 plumes. But wait, the actual data is that when n_B is plated on B, 4 plumes are found; when n_K is plated on B, 40 plumes are found.\n\nAssuming n_B and n_K are similar in concentration, the ratio of plumes would reflect the recombination rate. Specifically, the ratio of plumes from B vs. K should correspond to (1 - R)^2, assuming equal concentrations and independent events. But perhaps it's simpler to consider the individual probabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s define p as the recombination probability. When n_B phages are plated on B, the expected number of successful infections is n_B * (1 - p). Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, it's n_K * (1 - p). However, according to the experiment, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40. \n\nBut wait, actually, when n_B is plated on B, the phages from strain B (the lysogenic ones) do integrate into B with probability p, leading to some infections. Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, the phages from strain K (the lysogenic ones) do not integrate into B, so all their infections are successful.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of plumes from B to K is 4/40 = 1/10. Assuming that the concentrations of n_B and n_K are the same, this ratio would be approximately (1 - p)^2, because both (1 - p) would contribute to the plume counts. Therefore, (1 - p)^2 \u2248 1/10 \u2192 1 - p \u2248 sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 p \u2248 1 - 0.316 \u2248 0.684. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because the options are much smaller. Maybe my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let\u2019s consider that when n_B phages are plated on B, the expected number of plumes is n_B * (1 - p). Similarly, when n_K phages are plated on B, the expected number is n_K * (1 - p). But in reality, the number of plumes when n_B is plated on B is 4, and when n_K is plated on B is 40. Assuming n_B and n_K are the same in concentration, say x, then:\n\n4 = x * (1 - p)\n40 = x * (1 - p)\n\nBut this leads to a contradiction unless 4=40, which isn't possible. Therefore, my initial assumption might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio of plumes is related to the product of the recombination rates. Or maybe the difference comes from considering the variance in integration efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the plumes represent the number of successful infections, and the recombination rate affects this.\n\nAnother angle: The expected number of recombinants (successful infections) on strain B when n_B phages are plated on it is n_B * (1 - R). Similarly, when n_K phages are plated on B, it's n_K * (1 - R). However, in our case, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40 plumes. But if n_B and n_K are the same, then 4 = n_B*(1-R) and 40 = n_K*(1-R), which again leads to inconsistency.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the number of phages is not the same. For example, if n_B is plated on strain B and n_K is plated on strain B, but n_B is larger than n_K due to dilution. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that when lysogenic phages (strain B) are plated on strain B, the number of plumes is 4; when lysogenic phages (strain K) are plated on strain B, the number is 40. Wait, but the same phage line is used for both plates. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Then half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Four plumes on K and 40 on B. So, each half is split into two: one part is high concentration (diluted 1:10^7) and the other is lower concentration (diluted 1:10^5). Then, one half (high concentration) is plated on strain B's lawn, and the other half (lower concentration) is plated on strain K's lawn. In the first half, 4 plumes appear, indicating 4 successful infections on strain B. In the second half, 40 plumes appear on strain K, indicating 40 successful infections on strain K.\n\nWait, but if the same phage is used for both, why would it show up differently? It seems like the phage's activity depends on whether it's integrated into the host's chromosome. So, when the phage is from strain K (the lysogenic phage), it shouldn't integrate into strain B, so it would infect strain B completely. When the phage is from strain B, it might integrate into strain B with some probability, leading to partial infection. \n\nBut in this experiment, the phage is from strain B when it's plated on strain B, and from strain K when it's plated on strain B. Wait, no\u2014it's the same phage being used. Let me clarify:\n\nEach half is split into two: one is a high concentration (diluted 1:10^7) and the other is a low concentration (diluted 1:10^5). These are then plated on separate lattices: one on strain B's lawn and the other on strain K's lawn.\n\nSo, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on strain B's lawn. If the phage integrates into strain B, it will cause a successful infection (plume). Similarly, the high concentration (1:10^5) is plated on strain K's lawn. Again, the phage either integrates into strain K or not. But since the phage is the same, it can either integrate into strain B or not, depending on whether it's from strain B or K.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage is from strain B when it's plated on strain B, and from strain K when it's plated on strain K. So, when you plate the lysogenic phage (strain B) on strain B's lawn, it may integrate into B, leading to some infections. When you plate the lysogenic phage (strain K) on strain B's lawn, it doesn't integrate into B, so all its infections are successful. Similarly, when you plate the lysogenic phage (strain B) on strain K's lawn, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But the question is about the recombination between the two mutants, which refers to whether the lysogenic phage integrates into a different host.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. The two mutants are both lysogenic phages. Lysogenic phages replicate within the bacterial genome and produce new prophages. If the phage integrates into a host, it becomes a prophage and can no longer replicate. Otherwise, it remains a lysogenic phage and continues to replicate.\n\nIn the experiment, when you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain B) on strain B, some phages integrate into B, causing successful infections (plumes). When you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain K) on strain B, none integrate into B, so all infections are successful (plumes). Similarly, when you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain B) on strain K, none integrate into K, so all infections are successful.\n\nHowever, the observed plumes are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, but the same phage is used for both plates. So, when the phage is from strain B and plated on strain B, it may integrate into B, causing some plumes. When the phage is from strain B and plated on strain K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But in the experiment, it's split into two halves: one half is high concentration (1:10^7) plated on strain B, resulting in 4 plumes, and the other half is low concentration (1:10^5) plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. If the phage is from strain B and is plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to some plumes. If the same phage is plated on strain K, it cannot integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But in the experiment, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on strain B, giving 4 plumes, implying that some phages integrated into B. The low concentration (1:10^5) is plated on strain K, giving 40 plumes, implying that all phages integrated into K.\n\nBut wait, the phage is the same in both cases. So, when the phage is from strain B and is plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to successful infections (plumes). When the same phage is plated on strain K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all its infections are successful. However, the experiment shows that when the phage is plated on strain B, it results in 4 plumes, implying some integration, and when it's plated on strain K, it results in 40 plumes, implying full integration. But this contradicts because the same phage can't integrate into both B and K at the same time. Therefore, perhaps the issue is that the phage is not the same in both experiments. Instead, it's a single lysogenic phage line, and during the experiment, two different strains are tested: one where the phage is from strain B and another where it's from strain K. But that doesn't make sense because the phage itself is from strain B and K separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the phage is from strain B and K, but the lysogenic phage is from strain B when it's in the high concentration (1:10^7), and from strain K when it's in the low concentration (1:10^5). No, that wouldn't make sense because the phage is the same in both cases. The experiment uses a single lysogenic phage line, which can only integrate into one host at a time. So, when it's plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to some plumes. When it's plated on strain K, it can't integrate into K, so all its plumes are successful.\n\nBut in the experiment, when the phage is plated on strain B, it results in 4 plumes, and when it's plated on strain K, it results in 40 plumes. However, since the phage is the same, it can only integrate into one host at a time. So, if the phage is from strain B, it should integrate into B when plated on B, and successfully infect K when plated on K. But the observed data is the opposite: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that when the phage is from strain B and plated on B, it doesn't integrate into B, so all infections are successful, leading to 40 plumes on B. Similarly, when the phage is from strain K and plated on B, it integrates into B, leading to 4 plumes on B.\n\nWait, but the phage is from strain K when it's plated on B. So, if the phage integrates into B, it would cause a successful infection on B. Similarly, when the phage is from strain B and plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful on K. But in the experiment, when the phage is from strain K and plated on B, we got 4 plumes on B. And when the phage is from strain B and plated on K, we got 40 plumes on K.\n\nWait, but the phage is the same in both cases. So, when the phage is from strain K and is plated on B, it integrates into B, causing some infections (plumes). When the phage is from strain B and is plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful on K. But the data shows 4 plumes on B (when phage from K is plated on B) and 40 plumes on K (when phage from B is plated on K). This makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the recombination occurs only when the phage integrates into the host. When the phage is from strain K and is plated on B, it integrates into B, leading to some plumes. When the phage is from strain B and is plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all its infections are successful. The ratio of plumes on K to B would indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nBut in the experiment, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4, so the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests that only 10% of the phages integrate into B, leading to successful infections. The remaining 90% remain lysogenic and infect K fully.\n\nIf the recombination rate R is the probability that a phage integrates into a host, then the expected number of successful infections on B would be (number of phages on B) * (1 - R). Similarly, on K, it would be (number of phages on K) * (1 - R). But since the same phage is used, the number of phages on B and K might differ. Wait, but in the experiment, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on B, and the low concentration (1:10^5) is plated on K. So, the number of phages available depends on the dilution.\n\nAssuming the same concentration, the number of phages on B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So four plumes mean four successful infections, meaning four phages have integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nNow, when you plate the lysogenic phages (which cause lysogeny) on a strain B lawn, you expect fewer plumes than if they were on strain K. If the phages had no recombination, they would all integrate into strain B's chromosome, leading to more successful infections and more plumes. However, here we see that when lysogenic phages are plated on strain B, they don't get as many plumes as when they're plated on strain K. This indicates that some integration has happened between the two mutants\u2014so the recombination rate must be low enough that most phages don't integrate into strain B, allowing them to infect strain B successfully, while the lysogenic phages (which don't integrate into strain B) also infect strain B.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant plumes is N = (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are the numbers of each type of phage. Here, n1 is the lysogenic phages (plated on strain B) at 1:10^7 dilution, and n2 is the lysogenic phages (plated on strain K) at 1:10^5 dilution. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is to consider the proportion of each type. Alternatively, another way is to calculate the probability that a phage integrates into a specific host and then use that to find the expected number of plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the recombination rate R. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes is given by:\n\nExpected plumes = (n1 * n2) / (N_total)\n\nWhere:\n- n1 is the number of lysogenic phages plated on strain B.\n- n2 is the number of lysogenic phages plated on strain K.\n- N_total is the total number of phages.\n\nBut wait, actually, each phage is present at different concentrations. Since n1 is 1:10^7 and n2 is 1:10^5, their concentrations are different. To compare, let's express them in terms of number per mL. Let\u2019s assume equal volumes for simplicity. Then n1 = 1e-7 and n2 = 1e-5.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants (recombined phages) would be proportional to (n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2). Plugging in the values:\n\n(1e-7 * 1e-5) / (1e-7 + 1e-5) = (1e-12) / (1.01e-5) \u2248 9.9e-8.\n\nThis is very small, which suggests low recombination. Now, how does this relate to the observed plumes? Each recombinant phage will lead to a successful infection on the respective host, contributing to the plume count.\n\nIn our case, when lysogenic phages (from strain B) are plated on strain B, they should integrate into strain B with recombination rate R, leading to some successful infections. Similarly, when lysogenic phages from strain K are plated on strain B, they won't integrate into B, so all their infections will be non-recombinant. \n\nThe observed plumes are 4 on K and 40 on B. Assuming the same volume, the ratio of plumes is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That suggests that the probability of integration is lower on the K side compared to B. Wait, but the lysogenic phages from K shouldn't integrate into B, so they should all infect B successfully. On the B side, some phages integrate into B, leading to some successful infections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to determine how much of the lysogenic phages integrate into the host. The presence of some plumes on B despite no recombination implies that some phages did integrate into B. Conversely, when they're plated on K, they don't integrate into B, so they all infect B.\n\nSo, the fraction of lysogenic phages that integrate into B is the recombination rate R. Let's denote the number of lysogenic phages as n_B (on strain B) and n_K (on strain K).\n\nWhen n_B is plated on B, the expected number of successful infections (plumes) is n_B * (1 - R). Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, the expected number is n_K * (1 - R). However, in our case, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40 plumes. But wait, the actual data is that when n_B is plated on B, 4 plumes are found; when n_K is plated on B, 40 plumes are found.\n\nAssuming n_B and n_K are similar in concentration, the ratio of plumes would reflect the recombination rate. Specifically, the ratio of plumes from B vs. K should correspond to (1 - R)^2, assuming equal concentrations and independent events. But perhaps it's simpler to consider the individual probabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s define p as the recombination probability. When n_B phages are plated on B, the expected number of successful infections is n_B * (1 - p). Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, it's n_K * (1 - p). However, according to the experiment, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40. \n\nBut wait, actually, when n_B is plated on B, the phages from strain B (the lysogenic ones) do integrate into B with probability p, leading to some infections. Similarly, when n_K is plated on B, the phages from strain K (the lysogenic ones) do not integrate into B, so all their infections are successful.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of plumes from B to K is 4/40 = 1/10. Assuming that the concentrations of n_B and n_K are the same, this ratio would be approximately (1 - p)^2, because both (1 - p) would contribute to the plume counts. Therefore, (1 - p)^2 \u2248 1/10 \u2192 1 - p \u2248 sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 p \u2248 1 - 0.316 \u2248 0.684. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because the options are much smaller. Maybe my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let\u2019s consider that when n_B phages are plated on B, the expected number of plumes is n_B * (1 - p). Similarly, when n_K phages are plated on B, the expected number is n_K * (1 - p). But in reality, the number of plumes when n_B is plated on B is 4, and when n_K is plated on B is 40. Assuming n_B and n_K are the same in concentration, say x, then:\n\n4 = x * (1 - p)\n40 = x * (1 - p)\n\nBut this leads to a contradiction unless 4=40, which isn't possible. Therefore, my initial assumption might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio of plumes is related to the product of the recombination rates. Or maybe the difference comes from considering the variance in integration efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the plumes represent the number of successful infections, and the recombination rate affects this.\n\nAnother angle: The expected number of recombinants (successful infections) on strain B when n_B phages are plated on it is n_B * (1 - R). Similarly, when n_K phages are plated on B, it's n_K * (1 - R). However, in our case, when n_B is plated on B, we get 4 plumes, and when n_K is plated on B, we get 40 plumes. But if n_B and n_K are the same, then 4 = n_B*(1-R) and 40 = n_K*(1-R), which again leads to inconsistency.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the number of phages is not the same. For example, if n_B is plated on strain B and n_K is plated on strain B, but n_B is larger than n_K due to dilution. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that when lysogenic phages (strain B) are plated on strain B, the number of plumes is 4; when lysogenic phages (strain K) are plated on strain B, the number is 40. Wait, but the same phage line is used for both plates. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Then half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Four plumes on K and 40 on B. So, each half is split into two: one part is high concentration (diluted 1:10^7) and the other is lower concentration (diluted 1:10^5). Then, one half (high concentration) is plated on strain B's lawn, and the other half (lower concentration) is plated on strain K's lawn. In the first half, 4 plumes appear, indicating 4 successful infections on strain B. In the second half, 40 plumes appear on strain K, indicating 40 successful infections on strain K.\n\nWait, but if the same phage is used for both, why would it show up differently? It seems like the phage's activity depends on whether it's integrated into the host's chromosome. So, when the phage is from strain K (the lysogenic phage), it shouldn't integrate into strain B, so it would infect strain B completely. When the phage is from strain B, it might integrate into strain B with some probability, leading to partial infection. \n\nBut in this experiment, the phage is from strain B when it's plated on strain B, and from strain K when it's plated on strain B. Wait, no\u2014it's the same phage being used. Let me clarify:\n\nEach half is split into two: one is a high concentration (diluted 1:10^7) and the other is a low concentration (diluted 1:10^5). These are then plated on separate lattices: one on strain B's lawn and the other on strain K's lawn.\n\nSo, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on strain B's lawn. If the phage integrates into strain B, it will cause a successful infection (plume). Similarly, the high concentration (1:10^5) is plated on strain K's lawn. Again, the phage either integrates into strain K or not. But since the phage is the same, it can either integrate into strain B or not, depending on whether it's from strain B or K.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage is from strain B when it's plated on strain B, and from strain K when it's plated on strain K. So, when you plate the lysogenic phage (strain B) on strain B's lawn, it may integrate into B, leading to some infections. When you plate the lysogenic phage (strain K) on strain B's lawn, it doesn't integrate into B, so all its infections are successful. Similarly, when you plate the lysogenic phage (strain B) on strain K's lawn, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But the question is about the recombination between the two mutants, which refers to whether the lysogenic phage integrates into a different host.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. The two mutants are both lysogenic phages. Lysogenic phages replicate within the bacterial genome and produce new prophages. If the phage integrates into a host, it becomes a prophage and can no longer replicate. Otherwise, it remains a lysogenic phage and continues to replicate.\n\nIn the experiment, when you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain B) on strain B, some phages integrate into B, causing successful infections (plumes). When you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain K) on strain B, none integrate into B, so all infections are successful (plumes). Similarly, when you plate the lysogenic phage (from strain B) on strain K, none integrate into K, so all infections are successful.\n\nHowever, the observed plumes are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, but the same phage is used for both plates. So, when the phage is from strain B and plated on strain B, it may integrate into B, causing some plumes. When the phage is from strain B and plated on strain K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But in the experiment, it's split into two halves: one half is high concentration (1:10^7) plated on strain B, resulting in 4 plumes, and the other half is low concentration (1:10^5) plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. If the phage is from strain B and is plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to some plumes. If the same phage is plated on strain K, it cannot integrate into K, so all infections are successful. But in the experiment, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on strain B, giving 4 plumes, implying that some phages integrated into B. The low concentration (1:10^5) is plated on strain K, giving 40 plumes, implying that all phages integrated into K.\n\nBut wait, the phage is the same in both cases. So, when the phage is from strain B and is plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to successful infections (plumes). When the same phage is plated on strain K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all its infections are successful. However, the experiment shows that when the phage is plated on strain B, it results in 4 plumes, implying some integration, and when it's plated on strain K, it results in 40 plumes, implying full integration. But this contradicts because the same phage can't integrate into both B and K at the same time. Therefore, perhaps the issue is that the phage is not the same in both experiments. Instead, it's a single lysogenic phage line, and during the experiment, two different strains are tested: one where the phage is from strain B and another where it's from strain K. But that doesn't make sense because the phage itself is from strain B and K separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the phage is from strain B and K, but the lysogenic phage is from strain B when it's in the high concentration (1:10^7), and from strain K when it's in the low concentration (1:10^5). No, that wouldn't make sense because the phage is the same in both cases. The experiment uses a single lysogenic phage line, which can only integrate into one host at a time. So, when it's plated on strain B, it can integrate into B, leading to some plumes. When it's plated on strain K, it can't integrate into K, so all its plumes are successful.\n\nBut in the experiment, when the phage is plated on strain B, it results in 4 plumes, and when it's plated on strain K, it results in 40 plumes. However, since the phage is the same, it can only integrate into one host at a time. So, if the phage is from strain B, it should integrate into B when plated on B, and successfully infect K when plated on K. But the observed data is the opposite: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that when the phage is from strain B and plated on B, it doesn't integrate into B, so all infections are successful, leading to 40 plumes on B. Similarly, when the phage is from strain K and plated on B, it integrates into B, leading to 4 plumes on B.\n\nWait, but the phage is from strain K when it's plated on B. So, if the phage integrates into B, it would cause a successful infection on B. Similarly, when the phage is from strain B and plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful on K. But in the experiment, when the phage is from strain K and plated on B, we got 4 plumes on B. And when the phage is from strain B and plated on K, we got 40 plumes on K.\n\nWait, but the phage is the same in both cases. So, when the phage is from strain K and is plated on B, it integrates into B, causing some infections (plumes). When the phage is from strain B and is plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all infections are successful on K. But the data shows 4 plumes on B (when phage from K is plated on B) and 40 plumes on K (when phage from B is plated on K). This makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the recombination occurs only when the phage integrates into the host. When the phage is from strain K and is plated on B, it integrates into B, leading to some plumes. When the phage is from strain B and is plated on K, it doesn't integrate into K, so all its infections are successful. The ratio of plumes on K to B would indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nBut in the experiment, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4, so the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests that only 10% of the phages integrate into B, leading to successful infections. The remaining 90% remain lysogenic and infect K fully.\n\nIf the recombination rate R is the probability that a phage integrates into a host, then the expected number of successful infections on B would be (number of phages on B) * (1 - R). Similarly, on K, it would be (number of phages on K) * (1 - R). But since the same phage is used, the number of phages on B and K might differ. Wait, but in the experiment, the high concentration (1:10^7) is plated on B, and the low concentration (1:10^5) is plated on K. So, the number of phages available depends on the dilution.\n\nAssuming the same concentration, the number of phages on B",

In this case, the number of recombinant plumes should be the difference between the expected and actual counts. Since all the phages from the first half (higher dilution) should infect strain B, we'd expect 100% of them to do so. However, only 40 did, meaning 60 didn't. These 60 correspond to the recombined phages. The second group had 4 plumes, which are less than expected, indicating fewer original phages could infect strain K. The expected number here would be half of 40 (since half the population was used for each), which is 20. But only 4 actually succeeded, so 16 didn't. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the phages from the high-dilution half (diluted 1:10^7) infect strain B, then the number of infections should be proportional to their copy numbers. Similarly, the low-dilution half (1:10^5) should have fewer phages, so fewer infections. The observed numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. So the high-dilution half caused 40 infections, and the low-dilution half caused 4. Since the phages from the high-dilution half are more numerous, their infections should dominate. \n\nTo calculate rf, we look at how many recombinants (phages that changed alleles) occurred. In this case, the high-dilution half produced more infections on strain B, suggesting that any mutation in their phage gene combined with strain B's mutation. Strain K has no mutation, so none of those phages should have caused K to be lysed. Therefore, the number of recombinant plumes is equal to the number of high-dilution half plumes. \n\nSo rf = (recombinant + 1/2) / total. Here, the recombinant is 40 (from the high-dilution half), and the total is 44 (40+4). So rf = (40 + 0.5)/44 \u2248 40.5/44 \u2248 0.9204, which is about 92%. That seems too high. Maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant events is the difference between expected and observed. For example, expecting all high-dilution half to cause infections on B, which would be 40, but only 4 did. That leaves 36 recombinant events.

Alternatively, considering that the high-dilution half led to more infections on B, implying that any mutations in their phage would lead to B being lysed. So the number of recombinants is the number of high-dilution half plumes, which is 40. The total number of events is 44 (40+4). So rf = 40/(40+4) \u2248 89%, which still seems high. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of recombination.

Or perhaps the recombination refers to whether the two mutations are present in the same phage.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that the phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. So both types of phages have their own rII mutations, possibly different ones. The experiment shows that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is only partially affected, implying that the lysogenic phage's mutation might interfere with the lytic phage's effect. But since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the presence of multiple mutations in the phage allows for some interaction, leading to more successful infections when both mutations are present.\n\nAlternatively, the results suggest that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to integrate with the host DNA, thus affecting its ability to lyse the bacteria. This integration would be a form of recombination. The recombination level depends on how often the mutations are present in the phages.\n\nIn genetic terms, if the recombination frequency is low, say around 0-1%, then the chance of both mutations being present in a phage is low, meaning fewer interactions would lead to lower total infections. In this case, the results show that strain B is only partially affected, which could mean that the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing interference with the lytic phage's effect. Since the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to failure, perhaps it's a dominant recombination type where the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of interference.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two organisms. In this context, it's likely referring to the proportion of time or the fraction of the time when both mutations are present in the same phage.\n\nLooking at the experimental data, when both types of phages are present, the bacteria are only partially affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is somehow interfering with the lytic phage's effect. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it less effective at integrating with the host DNA, thus reducing its ability to lyse the bacteria. This would involve a high level of recombination because the lysogenic phage must successfully integrate its mutation into the host's DNA before it can function as a lytic phage.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinant events (lytic phages) is 40 on strain B, and the number of non-recombinant events (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain K. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Actually, each half of the plate is tested separately. For the first half (diluted 1:10^7), 40 plumes were found on strain B. For the second half (diluted 1:10^5), 4 plumes were found on strain K.\n\nThis suggests that when both types of phages are present, the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing problems. So the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is low, leading to fewer successful infections. The recombination frequency can be estimated from the ratio of plumes observed. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of recombinant events is (R * total number of phages). Here, the total number of phages is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant events (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K. Hmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both types are present, the lytic phage's mutation is causing issues, leading to 40 successful infections on strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage's mutation is effectively neutralizing the lytic phage's ability to infect. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high, indicating that both mutations are present in most of the phages.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency in genetic crosses:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of non-recombinants / Total)\n\nHere, the total number of phages is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. The number of non-recombinants (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain B, but actually, the lysogenic phages don't carry the mutation, so they shouldn't contribute to the non-recombinant count. Wait, this approach might not be correct.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to consider the ratio of plumes. On dilution 1:10^7, 40 phages were found on strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage was successful in integrating its mutation, while on 1:10^5, only 4 phages were found on strain K, indicating that the lysogenic phage's mutation may not have integrated well at higher dilutions.\n\nAssuming that at lower dilutions (higher concentration), the lysogenic phage's mutation integrates more efficiently, leading to fewer successful infections. Therefore, the recombination frequency can be approximated by the ratio of plumes observed. \n\nGiven that the number of plumes increased at lower dilutions (more plumes detected), this suggests that the mutation is allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate within the host more easily, increasing the likelihood of successful infections. However, since the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing interference, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely related to the number of plumes.\n\nIf at 1:10^5 dilution, only 4 phages were found on strain K, compared to 40 on strain B at 1:10^7 dilution, this suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the probability of recombination is proportional to the number of plumes observed. \n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the recombination frequency. Then, the number of recombinant events (lytic phages) is proportional to R. Given that at 1:10^5 dilution, only 4 were found, whereas at 1:10^7 dilution, 40 were found, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 1/10. Assuming that this ratio equals R, then R = 0.1 percent. \n\nWait, but let me think again. At higher dilutions, the number of plumes decreases, implying that fewer phages are showing recombination. Therefore, if R is 0.1 percent, then the expected number of plumes should decrease by a factor of 100 (since R is a small fraction), which matches the observation: 4 vs. 40.

Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it less effective at integrating with the host DNA, thus reducing its ability to lyse the bacteria. This would involve a high level of recombination because the lysogenic phage must successfully integrate its mutation into the host's DNA before it can function as a lytic phage.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinant events (lytic phages) is 40 on strain B, and the number of non-recombinant events (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain K. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Actually, each half of the plate is tested separately. For the first half (diluted 1:10^7), 40 plumes were found on strain B. For the second half (diluted 1:10^5), 4 plumes were found on strain K.\n\nThis suggests that when both types of phages are present, the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing problems. So the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is low, leading to fewer successful infections. The recombination frequency can be estimated from the ratio of plumes observed. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of recombinant events is (R * total number of phages). Here, the total number of phages is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant events (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K. Hmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both types are present, the lytic phage's mutation is causing issues, leading to 40 successful infections on strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage's mutation is effectively neutralizing the lytic phage's ability to infect. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high, indicating that both mutations are present in most of the phages.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency in genetic crosses:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of non-recombinants / Total)\n\nHere, the total number of phages is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. The number of non-recombinants (lysogenic phages) is 40 on strain B, but actually, the lysogenic phages don't carry the mutation, so they shouldn't contribute to the non-recombinant count. Wait, this approach might not be correct.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to consider the ratio of plumes. On dilution 1:10^7, 40 phages were found on strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage was successful in integrating its mutation, while on 1:10^5, only 4 phages were found on strain K, indicating that the lysogenic phage's mutation may not have integrated well at higher dilutions.\n\nAssuming that at lower dilutions (higher concentration), the lysogenic phage's mutation integrates more efficiently, leading to fewer successful infections. Therefore, the recombination frequency can be approximated by the ratio of plumes observed. \n\nGiven that the number of plumes increased at lower dilutions (more plumes detected), this suggests that the mutation is allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate within the host more easily, increasing the likelihood of successful infections. However, since the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing interference, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely related to the number of plumes.\n\nIf at 1:10^5 dilution, only 4 phages were found on strain K, compared to 40 on strain B at 1:10^7 dilution, this suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the probability of recombination is proportional to the number of plumes observed. \n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the recombination frequency. Then, the number of recombinant events (lytic phages) is proportional to R. Given that at 1:10^5 dilution, only 4 were found, whereas at 1:10^7 dilution, 40 were found, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 1/10. Assuming that this ratio equals R, then R = 0.1 percent. \n\nWait, but let me think again. At higher dilutions, the number of plumes decreases, implying that fewer phages are showing recombination. Therefore, if R is 0.1 percent, then the expected number of plumes should decrease by a factor of 100 (since R is a small fraction), which matches the observation: 4 vs. 40. So yes, R = 0.1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes indicate many more infections than expected for the lower dilution.\n\nLet me think about what happens during phage infection. Normally, a phage with a lysogenic mutation (like the lysogenic phage) would integrate its gene into the host DNA and replicate without lysing the cell. If a phage has a lysogenic mutation (like the lytic phage), it doesn't integrate and replicates within the same cell, leading to lytic fission and eventual death upon lysing the cell. However, if both types are present in the same phage, the lysogenic phage might have a higher chance of integrating, thus reducing the effect of the lysogenic mutation.\n\nIn this experiment, the first group (diluted 1:10^7) is likely to be the lysogenic phage because it's less likely to integrate into the host DNA. The second group (diluted 1:10^5) is probably the lysogenic phage as well, but maybe there's some interaction where the lysogenic phage integrates and then somehow affects the lysogenic mutation? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates into the host and then somehow recruits the second type, causing interference.\n\nThe results show that on strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, meaning 40 infections occurred. On strain K's lawn, there are only 4 plumes. Since the plumes represent individual infections, having such a significant difference could suggest that the presence of the lysogenic phage from the first group is influencing the second group's activity.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Both groups should be lysogenic. Maybe the phages are being titrated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the integration of the lysogenic phage from the first group affects the lysogenic mutation in the second group.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of interactions. The probability that a phage integrates into the host DNA is related to the fitness cost. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a fitness cost, it might integrate at a certain rate. The presence of the lysogenic phage from the first group could either increase or decrease the likelihood of the lysogenic mutation in the second group.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates into the host, it might interfere with the lysogenic mutation in the second group. This would reduce the number of times the lysogenic mutation can occur in the second group. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage integrates, it might enhance the expression of the lysogenic mutation in the second group.\n\nGiven that the first group had 40 plumes and the second had only 4, let's consider possible scenarios. If the lysogenic phage integrates in the first group, it might suppress the lysogenic mutation in the second group, resulting in fewer infections. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage integrates in the second group, it might enhance the lysogenic mutation, increasing the number of infections.\n\nBut wait, the first group was also lysogenic. So maybe the lysogenic phage from the first group is causing some sort of cross-reactivity with the second group's lysogenic mutation. Like, the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates into the host and somehow recruits the second type, leading to interference.\n\nAlternatively, considering the frequency of plumes. On strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. That's a ratio of 10:1. If the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates, it could cause a suppression effect on the lysogenic mutation in the second group, resulting in fewer plumes. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage from the first group enhances the mutation in the second group, you'd see more plumes.\n\nBut why 4 vs 40? If the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates, it might reduce the number of times the lysogenic mutation occurs in the second group. So the first group's 40 plumes correspond to the lysogenic mutation occurring 40 times, while the second group's 4 plumes don't include the integrated phage. Hmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe another angle: the intensity of the phage. The first group was diluted 1:10^7, meaning there are 1e7 phages per ml. The second group is 1e5, which is ten times less concentrated. If the first group's phage integrates more efficiently, it might affect the second group's activity. But how?\n\nWait, the question asks for recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different species or phages. In this case, the two mutations in T_4 phages\u2014mutations in the lysogenic and lysogenic parts. The recombination would determine whether the two mutations interact or interfere.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected number of combined infections would be the product of their individual probabilities. But here, we're seeing a difference in the number of plumes, indicating some form of interaction.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the probability of a lysogenic phage integrating into the host is p. Then, the expected number of times the lysogenic mutation occurs in a population would depend on p. If the lysogenic phage from the first group integrates, it might either suppress or enhance the mutation in the second group.\n\nAssuming that the first group's phage integrates, it might prevent the second group's mutation from occurring, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if the first group's phage doesn't integrate, the second group's mutation can occur more frequently.\n\nGiven that the first group's plumes are much higher (40 vs 4), it seems like the lysogenic phage from the first group is interfering with the second group's mutation. Therefore, the recombination is high, meaning the mutations are closely linked.\n\nTo quantify this, let's assume that the recombination fraction (or coefficient of coincidence) is c. If the two mutations are completely independent, c=1, meaning all events occur together. If they are perfectly complementary, c=0. If they are almost independent, c is close to 1. If they are highly recombinate, c is low.\n\nIn this case, since the first group's integration leads to reduced plumes in the second group, it suggests that the two mutations are highly recombinate. How much?\n\nWe can use the formula for the expected number of plumes under independence: E = p * q, where p is the probability of the first mutation and q the second. But in reality, we observe a certain number of events, say N, so N = p * q * F, where F is the total number of phages.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of ratios. If the first group's phage integrates, and this affects the second group, then the ratio of plumes could give us information about the recombination.\n\nSuppose the recombination coefficient is r. Then, the probability that both mutations occur is r, and the probability that neither occurs is (1-r)^2. Given that the first group's phage integrates, the probability that the second group's mutation occurs depends on r.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The initial concentration of phages is such that when they integrate, they affect the subsequent infections. The first group's phages are more concentrated, so if they integrate, it might disrupt the second group's phage, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, if the first group's phages integrate, it reduces the number of times the second group's mutation occurs. The observed number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. So the ratio is 10:1.\n\nThis suggests that the integration of the first group's phage inactivates the second group's mutation 10 times. If the recombination is complete, then the second group's mutation wouldn't occur, but here we have a small number of events.\n\nWait, no, because the first group's integration isn't necessarily causing the second mutation to disappear entirely. It just makes it less frequent. So if the first group's phage integrates, it might slightly reduce the number of times the second group's mutation can occur. Hence, the observed 40 vs 4 plumes reflects this.\n\nNow, to find the recombination coefficient, r. If the two mutations are completely independent, all events would co-occur, giving E = p*q. Here, p is the probability of the first mutation, and q the second. But given that the first group's phage integrates, it might influence the second group's mutation.\n\nHowever, without knowing p, it's tricky. But perhaps we can estimate based on the observed data. If the first group's phage integrates, and this leads to a reduction in the second group's mutations, then the recombination must be high.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest recombination is 5%, followed by 2%, etc. Since the observed ratio is 10:1, which is quite high, suggesting a high degree of recombination, the answer might be around 5% or 0.05%.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the expected number of events:\n\nNumber of events = (p * q) / (1 - r)\n\nWhere p is the probability of the first mutation, q the second, and r the recombination coefficient.\n\nBut I'm not confident about this formula. Another approach is to think about the ratio of plumes. If the first group's phage integrates and affects the second group's mutation, the ratio of plumes could help determine the recombination.\n\nIn the end, considering the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is D. 0.05 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me try again. The main point is about recombination between the two mutants. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different phages within the same DNA molecule. In this case, if the two mutants come from the same T_4 phage, their recombination would determine whether they cause overlapping effects. If they have no recombination, they might cause independent events, leading to either both being effective or neither. But in reality, when both mutants are present, the effect depends on whether their regions have recombined.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of the D value, which measures the degree of recombination between two loci. The formula for D is:\n\nD = -log10(p)\n\nwhere p is the probability that two random phages from the population will have recombined at those loci. Alternatively, another approach is using the number of co-infections observed versus what would be expected under complete linkage.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plasmids (or infections) on each strain is given. For example, on strain B, 40 plasmids were found, and on strain K, 4 were found. Since both strains are being treated separately, the ratio of plasmids could indicate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAnother thought: the ratio of plasmid numbers after treatment tells us about the transmission efficiency. If the two mutants caused overlapping events, the total plasmid load would be higher than expected, indicating possible recombination. However, the presence of both mutants complicates things.\n\nLet me look up how to calculate the percentage of recombination using the data provided. From what I recall, the formula used is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (p)\n\nwhere p is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the number of plasmids on the treated plates (with both mutants) is N, then the chance of recombination is estimated based on the ratio of plasmids. For example, if treating with both mutants leads to a certain fraction of plasmids, we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * [1 - (N / (N + L))]\n\nWhere N is the number of plasmids observed in the treated plate, and L is the number of plasmids in the control. Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nPerhaps the key is to compare the number of plasmids on the treated and untreated plates. On the treated plate (with both mutants), you get 40 plasmids, and on the untreated, you'd expect fewer, depending on the background mutation rate.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to basic principles. When two mutations occur in the same phage, if they are linked (no recombination), they will cause the same effect. If they are unlinked, they'll cause independent effects. However, in this case, both mutations are causing issues in E. coli, so perhaps they're interacting in some way.\n\nWait, the problem says that when both types are present, half of the bacteria are divided into two groups. One group is treated with the first mutant and the other with the second, or both? Actually, no, the description is a bit confusing. It says: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So, each half is treated separately\u2014either with the first mutant or the second. Then, each plate is tested against the respective strain's lawn.\n\nSo, in the first half, which was treated with the first mutant, the bacteria were placed on strain B's lawn. Similarly, the second half was treated with the second mutant and placed on strain K's lawn. Each resulted in some number of plasmids (infections).\n\nNow, considering that the recombination determines whether the two mutants affect the same target. If they have recombined, their effects might overlap; otherwise, they might act independently.\n\nTo find the recombination percentage, I think we can use the following approach:\n\nWhen two mutations occur in the same phage, the chance that they are linked (no recombination) is determined by the number of times they cause overlapping events. If they are unlinked, the events are independent.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plasmids on the treated plates gives us information about the transmission efficiency. The ratio of plasmids on the treated vs. untreated plates can help us estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that without any recombination, the plasmid numbers would be lower because the phages don't mix effectively. With recombination, the plasmids would be more frequent, suggesting that the phages are mixing and causing overlapping effects.\n\nGiven that on the treated plates, there were 40 plasmids and on the untreated, let's say, without recombination, we might expect fewer. Suppose without recombination, the number would be lower, say X. Then, the difference tells us about the recombination.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact expectation, this approach might not be straightforward. Another method is to use the formula for calculating the recombination frequency:\n\nf = 100 * log10(N / (N + L))\n\nWhere N is the number of co-infections (plasmids on treated plates), and L is the number of non-co-infections (plasmids on untreated plates).\n\nBut wait, I think I might have this backward. Let me check: N is the number of co-infections, and L is the number of non-co-infections. The formula calculates the probability that two randomly selected phages have recombined. So,\n\nf = 100 * (1 - (L / (L + N)))\n\nThis makes sense because if there's a lot of co-infections (N >> L), the chance of recombination is low. Conversely, if L is much larger than N, the chance is high.\n\nIn our case, on the treated plates, N=40 (co-infections), and on the untreated plates, L=4 (non-co-infections). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Typically, L would represent the number of non-co-infections, which is usually much smaller than N.\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my understanding. Perhaps L is the number of non-co-infections, which would correspond to the background mutation rates. If the mutant phages are causing problems, then without recombination, the plasmids wouldn't accumulate as much.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is better expressed as:\n\n% Recombination = (number of co-infections - number of non-co-infections) / (number of co-infections + number of non-co-infections)\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me test this idea with the numbers.\n\nIf N=40 and L=4, then:\n\n(40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. That seems too high for a recombination frequency, which is usually less than 50%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (1 - (L / (N + L)))\n\nPlugging in L=4 and N=40:\n\n1 - (4/(40+4)) = 1 - 4/44 \u2248 1 - 0.09 \u2248 0.91 \u2192 91%. Still high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what N and L stand for. Maybe N is the total plasmids on the treated plates, and L is the total on the untreated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of recombination. If there is recombination, the number of plasmids on the treated plates would be higher because the phages are mixing and causing both mutants to act on the same bacteria.\n\nBut I'm still not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different angle. The question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The options are all percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%, so relatively small fractions.\n\nRecombination frequencies typically range from 0% to 100%, but most are below 1%. So, the answer must be a very small percentage.\n\nLooking at the options: F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, etc. So, likely, the answer is among the lower percentages.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutants on the treated plates indicates that recombination occurred. The higher the percentage, the more frequent the recombination.\n\nBut how do I quantify this?\n\nPerhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to recombination frequency. The coefficient of coincidence (COC) is the ratio of observed co-occurrence to the expected co-occurrence. COC = (number of double recombinants) / (expected number of double recombinants).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in some cases, the percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (1 - e^{-2*(N - L)/N})\n\nWhere N is the number of co-infections (treated plates) and L is the number of non-co-infections (untreated plates). This assumes that the excess over baseline (N-L) reflects the recombination events.\n\nPlugging in N=40 and L=4:\n\n2*(40 -4)/40 = 2*36/40 = 1.8\n\ne^{-1.8} \u2248 0.165\n\n1 - 0.165 = 0.835 \u2192 83.5%\n\nThat's even higher than before, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted N and L somewhere. Let me check the formula again. Maybe it's:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * ln(1 + (N - L)/L)\n\nBut that also seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (number of co-infections - number of non-co-infections) / (number of non-co-infections)\n\nWhich would give (40 -4)/4 = 36/4=9\u2192900%. That's impossible.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem states that when both mutants are present, half the bacteria are divided into two groups. One group is treated with the first mutant and placed on strain B, resulting in 40 plasmids. The other group is treated with the second mutant and placed on strain K, resulting in 4 plasmids.\n\nSo, in total, across both treatments, there are 40 + 4 = 44 plasmids. Now, if there was no recombination, each phage would cause its own effect, but since both are present, maybe some plasmids overlap.\n\nBut the actual number of plasmids suggests that recombination happened. Without recombination, the number of unique plasmids would be higher because the phages don't mix, allowing for independent infections.\n\nWait, but without recombination, each phage would cause its own effect, so the total plasmids would just be the sum of both. But with recombination, the same plasmids are being acted upon by both phages, potentially causing more plasmid load due to interference.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to connect this to the recombination percentage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids on the treated plates compared to the untreated can indicate the level of mixing. If the treated plates had significantly more plasmids, it suggests that the phages mixed and caused overlapping effects, implying recombination.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the number of plasmids on treated plates is higher than on untreated plates. But according to the data, the treated plates (with both mutants) have 40 plasmids, and the untreated plates (without recombination) would have fewer. However, the problem doesn't specify how many plasmids the untreated plates had. It only mentions that four were found on K and 40 on B.\n\nWait, perhaps the untreated plates (the other half) had a certain number of plasmids. If there was no recombination, the number of plasmids would be lower because the phages didn't interfere. If there was recombination, the number would be higher because some plasmids were shared.\n\nBut without knowing the number on the untreated plates, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the key lies in comparing the number of plasmids on each treated group to the number on the respective strains' plasmids.\n\nWait, the question provides that the other half is treated on strain K, resulting in 4 plasmids. So, perhaps the treated plates (with both mutants) have 40 plasmids, and the other treated plates have 4 plasmids on strain K.\n\nBut how does that relate to recombination? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids on the treated plates is proportional to the likelihood of recombination. If the treated plates had 40 plasmids, and the untreated had, say, 10, then the excess (30) could suggest recombination. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it this way: if the two mutants are completely linked (no recombination), then their combined effect would be additive, meaning that the number of plasmids would be the sum of both. However, if they are unlinked, their effects would be independent, so the number of plasmids would reflect the maximum possible.\n\nBut in reality, the number of plasmids would depend on the number of active phages. If recombination occurs, it allows some plasmids to be replicated by both mutants, increasing the overall plasmid load.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact numbers of plasmids on the untreated plates, this is tricky. However, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. Assuming that the untreated plates (the other half) had, say, 10 plasmids, then the treated plates (with both mutants) having 40 would imply that 30 plasmids are due to recombination. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids on the treated plates (40) minus the number on the untreated plates (let's assume, say, 10) would indicate the recombination events. 30 plasmids due to recombination, which might translate to a 30% recombination frequency, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, but none of the options are close to 30%. The highest option is H:5%. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nLet me think differently. The question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\n% Recombination = (100/ln(1/f)) * (1 - e^{-2f})\n\nwhere f is the coefficient of coincidence. But I don't know f here.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler approximation is:\n\n% Recombination \u2248 (Number of co-infections - Number of non-co-infections) / (Number of non-co-infections)\n\nIn our case, co-infections = 40, non-co-infections = 4. So,\n\n(40 - 4)/4 = 36/4 = 9 \u2192 900%. That's impossible. So, clearly, this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of co-infections - Number of non-co-infections) / (Total plasmids)\n\nBut I don't know the total plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids on the treated plates (40) minus the number on the untreated plates (let's say, x) equals the number of plasmids due to recombination.\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't compute it. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that the presence of both mutants on the treated plates suggests significant recombination, and the number of plasmids on the treated plates (40) relative to the number on the untreated plates (unknown) indicates the extent of recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that without recombination, the plasmids would be spread out evenly, whereas with recombination, some plasmids are shared. So, the number of plasmids on treated plates (40) minus the number on untreated (let's say, y) would indicate the increase due to recombination.\n\nBut again, without knowing y, this isn't helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that when recombination occurs, it creates additional plasmids by combining alleles from both mutants. Thus, the number of plasmids on treated plates would be higher than on untreated plates. So, if there's recombination, the treated plates have more plasmids, which would mean more chances for successful replication.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both mutants on the treated plates implies that recombination has occurred. To find the percentage, perhaps the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of plasmids on treated - Number on untreated) / (Number on treated)\n\nBut without knowing the untreated number, this isn't feasible. However, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. If the untreated plates (the other half) had, say, 10 plasmids, then the increase due to recombination would be 30. So, 30 plasmids due to recombination, which would correspond to a very high recombination frequency. But the options don't include such high values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question specifies that the treated plates (with both mutants) had 40 plasmids, and the other treated plates had 4. Maybe the 4 is on the other side, and the 40 is on the treated plates. So, the total plasmids across both sides are 44.\n\nIf there was no recombination, each phage would act independently, so the total plasmids would be the sum of both. However, with recombination, some plasmids are shared, so the total plasmids would be less than the sum. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of plasmids on the treated to the untreated plates indicates the likelihood of recombination. So, 40 treated to 10 untreated would imply a 40x higher chance, suggesting a high recombination rate. But again, the options don't go beyond 5%.\n\nWait, maybe the intended approach is to use the fact that the presence of both mutants on the treated plates suggests that recombination has occurred, and the percentage can be approximated based on the number of plasmids. Since 40 plasmids on the treated plates and 4 on the other, the excess (36) might indicate 900% re",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So, four plumes on K would mean four instances where the phage successfully lysed E. coli strain K, while 40 on B means more infections on B.\n\nHmm, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me try again. The main point is about recombination between the two mutants. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different phages within the same DNA molecule. In this case, if the two mutants come from the same T_4 phage, their recombination would determine whether they cause overlapping effects. If they have no recombination, they might cause independent events, leading to either both being effective or neither. But in reality, when both mutants are present, the effect depends on whether their regions have recombined.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of the D value, which measures the degree of recombination between two loci. The formula for D is:\n\nD = -log10(p)\n\nwhere p is the probability that two random phages from the population will have recombined at those loci. Alternatively, another approach is using the number of co-infections observed versus what would be expected under complete linkage.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plasmids (or infections) on each strain is given. For example, on strain B, 40 plasmids were found, and on strain K, 4 were found. Since both strains are being treated separately, the ratio of plasmids could indicate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAnother thought: the ratio of plasmid numbers after treatment tells us about the transmission efficiency. If the two mutants caused overlapping events, the total plasmid load would be higher than expected, indicating possible recombination. However, the presence of both mutants complicates things.\n\nLet me look up how to calculate the percentage of recombination using the data provided. From what I recall, the formula used is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (p)\n\nwhere p is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the number of plasmids on the treated plates (with both mutants) is N, then the chance of recombination is estimated based on the ratio of plasmids. For example, if treating with both mutants leads to a certain fraction of plasmids, we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * [1 - (N / (N + L))]\n\nWhere N is the number of plasmids observed in the treated plate, and L is the number of plasmids in the control. Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nPerhaps the key is to compare the number of plasmids on the treated and untreated plates. On the treated plate (with both mutants), you get 40 plasmids, and on the untreated, you'd expect fewer, depending on the background mutation rate.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should refer back to basic principles. When two mutations occur in the same phage, if they are linked (no recombination), they will cause the same effect. If they are unlinked, they'll cause independent effects. However, in this case, both mutations are causing issues in E. coli, so perhaps they're interacting in some way.\n\nWait, the problem says that when both types are present, half of the bacteria are divided into two groups. One group is treated with the first mutant and the other with the second, or both? Actually, no, the description is a bit confusing. It says: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So, each half is treated separately\u2014either with the first mutant or the second. Then, each plate is tested against the respective strain's lawn.\n\nSo, in the first half, which was treated with the first mutant, the bacteria were placed on strain B's lawn. Similarly, the second half was treated with the second mutant and placed on strain K's lawn. Each resulted in some number of plasmids (infections).\n\nNow, considering that the recombination determines whether the two mutants affect the same target. If they have recombined, their effects might overlap; otherwise, they might act independently.\n\nTo find the recombination percentage, I think we can use the following approach:\n\nWhen two mutations occur in the same phage, the chance that they are linked (no recombination) is determined by the number of times they cause overlapping events. If they are unlinked, the events are independent.\n\nIn this experiment, the number of plasmids on the treated plates gives us information about the transmission efficiency. The ratio of plasmids on the treated vs. untreated plates can help us estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that without any recombination, the plasmid numbers would be lower because the phages don't mix effectively. With recombination, the plasmids would be more frequent, suggesting that the phages are mixing and causing overlapping effects.\n\nGiven that on the treated plates, there were 40 plasmids and on the untreated, let's say, without recombination, we might expect fewer. Suppose without recombination, the number would be lower, say X. Then, the difference tells us about the recombination.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact expectation, this approach might not be straightforward. Another method is to use the formula for calculating the recombination frequency:\n\nf = 100 * log10(N / (N + L))\n\nWhere N is the number of co-infections (plasmids on treated plates), and L is the number of non-co-infections (plasmids on untreated plates).\n\nBut wait, I think I might have this backward. Let me check: N is the number of co-infections, and L is the number of non-co-infections. The formula calculates the probability that two randomly selected phages have recombined. So,\n\nf = 100 * (1 - (L / (L + N)))\n\nThis makes sense because if there's a lot of co-infections (N >> L), the chance of recombination is low. Conversely, if L is much larger than N, the chance is high.\n\nIn our case, on the treated plates, N=40 (co-infections), and on the untreated plates, L=4 (non-co-infections). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Typically, L would represent the number of non-co-infections, which is usually much smaller than N.\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my understanding. Perhaps L is the number of non-co-infections, which would correspond to the background mutation rates. If the mutant phages are causing problems, then without recombination, the plasmids wouldn't accumulate as much.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is better expressed as:\n\n% Recombination = (number of co-infections - number of non-co-infections) / (number of co-infections + number of non-co-infections)\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me test this idea with the numbers.\n\nIf N=40 and L=4, then:\n\n(40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. That seems too high for a recombination frequency, which is usually less than 50%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (1 - (L / (N + L)))\n\nPlugging in L=4 and N=40:\n\n1 - (4/(40+4)) = 1 - 4/44 \u2248 1 - 0.09 \u2248 0.91 \u2192 91%. Still high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what N and L stand for. Maybe N is the total plasmids on the treated plates, and L is the total on the untreated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of recombination. If there is recombination, the number of plasmids on the treated plates would be higher because the phages are mixing and causing both mutants to act on the same bacteria.\n\nBut I'm still not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different angle. The question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The options are all percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%, so relatively small fractions.\n\nRecombination frequencies typically range from 0% to 100%, but most are below 1%. So, the answer must be a very small percentage.\n\nLooking at the options: F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, etc. So, likely, the answer is among the lower percentages.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutants on the treated plates indicates that recombination occurred. The higher the percentage, the more frequent the recombination.\n\nBut how do I quantify this?\n\nPerhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to recombination frequency. The coefficient of coincidence (COC) is the ratio of observed co-occurrence to the expected co-occurrence. COC = (number of double recombinants) / (expected number of double recombinants).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in some cases, the percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * (1 - e^{-2*(N - L)/N})\n\nWhere N is the number of co-infections (treated plates) and L is the number of non-co-infections (untreated plates). This assumes that the excess over baseline (N-L) reflects the recombination events.\n\nPlugging in N=40 and L=4:\n\n2*(40 -4)/40 = 2*36/40 = 1.8\n\ne^{-1.8} \u2248 0.165\n\n1 - 0.165 = 0.835 \u2192 83.5%\n\nThat's even higher than before, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted N and L somewhere. Let me check the formula again. Maybe it's:\n\n% Recombination = 100 * ln(1 + (N - L)/L)\n\nBut that also seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (number of co-infections - number of non-co-infections) / (number of non-co-infections)\n\nWhich would give (40 -4)/4 = 36/4=9\u2192900%. That's impossible.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem states that when both mutants are present, half the bacteria are divided into two groups. One group is treated with the first mutant and placed on strain B, resulting in 40 plasmids. The other group is treated with the second mutant and placed on strain K, resulting in 4 plasmids.\n\nSo, in total, across both treatments, there are 40 + 4 = 44 plasmids. Now, if there was no recombination, each phage would cause its own effect, but since both are present, maybe some plasmids overlap.\n\nBut the actual number of plasmids suggests that recombination happened. Without recombination, the number of unique plasmids would be higher because the phages don't mix, allowing for independent infections.\n\nWait, but without recombination, each phage would cause its own effect, so the total plasmids would just be the sum of both.

So, perhaps the treated plates (with both mutants) have 40 plasmids, and the other treated plates have 4 plasmids on strain K.\n\nBut how does that relate to recombination? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids on the treated plates is proportional to the likelihood of recombination.

The highest option is H:5%. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nLet me think differently. The question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\n% Recombination = (100/ln(1/f)) * (1 - e^{-2f})\n\nwhere f is the coefficient of coincidence. But I don't know f here.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler approximation is:\n\n% Recombination \u2248 (Number of co-infections - Number of non-co-infections) / (Number of non-co-infections)\n\nIn our case, co-infections = 40, non-co-infections = 4. So,\n\n(40 - 4)/4 = 36/4 = 9 \u2192 900%. That's impossible. So, clearly, this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of co-infections - Number of non-co-infections) / (Total plasmids)\n\nBut I don't know the total plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids on the treated plates (40) minus the number on the untreated plates (let's say, x) equals the number of plasmids due to recombination.\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't compute it.

To find the percentage, perhaps the formula is:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of plasmids on treated - Number on untreated) / (Number on treated)\n\nBut without knowing the untreated number, this isn't feasible. However, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. If the untreated plates (the other half) had, say, 10 plasmids, then the increase due to recombination would be 30. So, 30 plasmids due to recombination, which would correspond to a very high recombination frequency. But the options don't include such high values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question specifies that the treated plates (with both mutants) had 40 plasmids, and the other treated plates had 4. Maybe the 4 is on the other side, and the 40 is on the treated plates. So, the total plasmids across both sides are 44.\n\nIf there was no recombination, each phage would act independently, so the total plasmids would be the sum of both. However, with recombination, some plasmids are shared, so the total plasmids would be less than the sum. But I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of plasmids on the treated to the untreated plates indicates the likelihood of recombination. So, 40 treated to 10 untreated would imply a 40x higher chance, suggesting a high recombination rate.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

    "rollout": " So if 40 happen on B, that means 40 bacteria have been lysed by phages from either type, but only half survived division. Similarly, 4 on K mean fewer infections, possibly due to lower dilution.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about what happens during phage infection. When a phage infects a bacterium, it integrates its genetic material into the host's genome. If the phage has a lysogenic element (like the wild-type), it stays inside the cell and can replicate multiple times before lysis. If it carries a mutation (like the rII mutation), which might interfere with replication or expression, then it might not be as effective or could cause different outcomes.\n\nIn this case, when both mutants are present, half of the cells show reduced division (maybe due to less lysing), while the other half shows normal behavior. The key here is figuring out how many times each mutation occurs and whether their presence leads to more or fewer events.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about interference. If one mutation inhibits the replication of the phage, then when both are present, the number of times the phage can infect decreases. So when both types are mixed, the overall effect depends on how much each reduces the number of phages available for replication.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose each mutation individually affects the number of phages that can infect a bacterium. For example, let\u2019s say Phage A (mutant) causes the phage to die after replication, reducing the number of viable phages. Phage B (wild type) doesn\u2019t die, so it can replicate multiple times.\n\nWhen both are present, the total number of phages available for replication is less than either alone. This would reduce the number of new phages that can infect subsequent bacteria, leading to fewer lysogenic phages being present. However, since the phages are mixed, some will still cause lytic fission and others lysogenic ones.\n\nBut in the experiment, only half the cells show reduced division, suggesting that the mixed conditions somehow balance the effects of both mutations. Maybe the interaction leads to a net reduction in the number of viable phages, causing some cells to lyse and others not.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the mixture is plated on strain B, 40% of the cells show reduced division. Plated on strain K, only 10%. That seems like the mixture caused a stronger effect on strain B than on strain K. Because strain K didn't get as much lysing, indicating that the phages' interactions favor the lysogenic type more in strain B's case.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the likelihood of lysing, whereas the lysogenic phage in strain B may have a higher efficacy or interaction with the phage DNA. Alternatively, the mutation might affect the expression of certain genes, making the lysogenic phage more efficient.\n\nThe question asks about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes. In phages, recombination usually refers to the mixing of genetic elements within the phage or between different phages.\n\nIf the mutations are recombining, it would change the way the phage integrates into the bacterial genome, affecting its ability to replicate. If they're not recombining, the mutations are independent, and their effects would add up multiplicatively.\n\nGiven that the mixture led to a stronger effect on strain B, it implies that the interaction between the two mutations enhances the lysogenic activity. This could happen through recombination, where the genetic elements are integrated into the same chromosome, increasing the efficiency of replication.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we might use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (p + q - pq)/1\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles involved. However, without knowing the exact distribution of the mutations, it's tricky. Another approach is to look at the ratio of successful plasmids between the two cultures.\n\nIn the first culture (strain B), 40% showed reduced division, meaning 60% survived. In the second (strain K), only 10% did. This suggests that the mixtures interact differently depending on the strain. If the mixtures are similar in each strain, it indicates that the mutations are interacting in a way that depends on the strain. Perhaps strain B's phage machinery is more sensitive to the lysogenic phage, while strain K's is less so.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are recombining, the presence of the lysogenic phage would increase the chance of integrating with the host phage DNA, enhancing its replication efficiency. This would lead to more lysogenic phages being present, but the exact impact depends on the recombination rate.\n\nLooking back at the options provided (A to J), the possible answers involve percentages ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. Since recombination rates are typically low, especially in phages, the most plausible answer is likely around 0.02-0.05%, corresponding to option E or I.

Since the first half was more dilute (1:10^7), meaning fewer cells per well, and the second half was less dilute (1:10^5). In the first case, if the mutation caused the lysogen to die, those cells would be more susceptible. But here, the lysogenic phage isn't causing death, so maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the combination leads to some selection for one mutation over the other. \n\nThe key point is that only the lysogenic phage did the problem, but when both types are present, some cells might have been resistant to one type. If the recombination is high, then perhaps the presence of one mutation selects against the other, leading to reduced expression of the lysogenic phage. So if most of the lysogenic phages die, then the remaining lysogenic phages might be partially expressed, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and cause lytic fission. But how does that relate to the numbers?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you mix two phages, if one has a mutation that confers resistance, it could affect the growth. For example, if the lysogenic phage is resistant to the lysogenic mutation, it might survive better. Conversely, the lysogenic phage might be resistant to the lysogenic mutation, allowing it to replicate. So when both types are present, the phage with the mutation that confers resistance might dominate, reducing the number of lysogenic phages available to cause lytic fission.\n\nIn the experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, all cells should die because they can't lyse. But in reality, only half of the cells die, meaning some cells survived. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow selected against. However, in the mixed case, the lysogenic phage does cause lytic fission, as seen in the K strain. Wait, but the results show 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive because if the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, why would it not produce more plumes? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the results.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. When only the lysogenic phage is present, only a subset of cells should die, while the rest should survive. When both are present, the cells that can't handle the mutation may die, selecting for cells where the lysogenic phage is functional. This could lead to a situation where the lysogenic phage can replicate more effectively, causing more lytic fission events.\n\nBut according to the experiment, the first half (more dilute, so fewer cells) had 40 plumes, and the second half (less dilute, more cells) had 4 plumes. That suggests that the more dilute sample, where the lysogenic phage wasn't active enough to kill the cells, had more plumes. That might mean that the lysogenic phage didn't kill those cells, allowing them to grow and potentially reproduce, leading to more infections. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination affects the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. If the lysogenic mutation is at a certain position, recombination could lead to different variants. Maybe the presence of one mutation allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively, increasing its survival rate, thus increasing the number of plumes. But in the mixed experiment, the lysogenic phage is still causing lytic fission, so the plumes increase in the more dilute sample.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall some basics. Recombination in phage DNA occurs during the phage's life cycle. When a lysogenic phage integrates its prophage (mutant) into the host genome, any mutations in the prophage will interfere with replication. Recombination can change the structure of the prophage, affecting whether it can replicate or lyse the host.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a mutation that confers resistance to the lysogenic phage's own mutation, then those cells would survive better. This would reduce the number of cells where the lysogenic phage can replicate, thereby reducing the number of plasmids produced. However, in our case, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is functional despite being under the influence of the lysogenic mutation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination reduces the number of lysogenic phages available to lyse the cells, making them more susceptible. So when only the lysogenic phage is present, the cells should lyse, but in reality, only half die. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow selected against, perhaps due to the presence of another mutation.\n\nLet me think about the numbers. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) had 4 plumes, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) had 40 plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Diluting more would mean fewer cells, so if the lysogenic phage is killing more cells, you'd expect fewer plumes, but here it's higher in the first half. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is not killing the cells, allowing them to grow and replicate, producing more plumes.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage is causing lytic fission, why wouldn't it produce more plumes? Unless the lysogenic phage is not able to lyse the cells, perhaps because of the mutation. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is being selected against because it's not effective, leading to the cells surviving and replicating more, producing more plumes.\n\nSo, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cells, so more cells survive and replicate, leading to more plumes. In the first half (dilute), without the lysogenic phage, fewer cells would lyse, but with the lysogenic phage, more cells lyse. However, in the mixed case, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so more cells replicate and lyse, leading to more plumes.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of the lysogenic mutation selects against the lysogenic phage, favoring the presence of the lysogenic phage over the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, the lysogenic phage is more likely to be present, even though it's under the influence of the lysogenic mutation, because it's better adapted.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency (RF) is calculated using the formula:\n\nRF = (1 - (f1 + f2 - f12))\n\nwhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutations, and f12 is the frequency of their recombinants.\n\nIn this case, we're looking for the recombination frequency between the two mutations. We have the number of plumes (which correspond to successful infections) in two groups: one with more dilution (lower chance of lysogeny) and one with lower dilution (higher chance of lysogeny).\n\nWhen both types are present, the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, leading to more plumes. When only the lysogenic is present, the lysogenic phage cannot lyse the cells, so more cells replicate and lyse, leading to more plumes. However, in the experiment, when only the lysogenic is present, half the cells die, implying some selection against the lysogenic phage, but when both are present, the lysogenic phage still causes lytic fission, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me approach it differently. Suppose the two mutations are recombined. The presence of one mutation makes the other more likely to be expressed. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage is more likely to express, causing lytic fission. When only the lysogenic is present, the lysogenic phage is not expressing, so it doesn't lyse, and more cells replicate, leading to more plumes.\n\nBut in the experiment, when only the lysogenic is present, half the cells die. That implies that the lysogenic phage is selective against itself, which shouldn't happen. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic mutation must select against itself, meaning it's becoming more dominant, leading to increased expression of the lysogenic phage, causing more plumes when both are present.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency indicates how often the two mutations are combined. If the RF is high, the recombination would occur frequently. But in this case, the number of plumes when both are present is higher than when only the lysogenic is present. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to express, indicating that the lysogenic mutation is more recombinant.\n\nTo find the RF, let's consider the ratio of plumes. In the first group (more dilution), the number of plumes is 40, and in the second group (less dilution), it's 4. So the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination happened 10 times more often than not. But RF is usually given as a percentage, so 1/10 would imply a very low RF, like 0.1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nE. 0.02%\nF. 0.05%\nG. 0.1%\n\nSince the ratio is 10:1, which corresponds to a RF of approximately 0.1%, option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic mutation must select against itself, meaning it's becoming more dominant, leading to increased expression of the lysogenic phage, causing more plumes when both are present.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency indicates how often the two mutations are combined. If the RF is high, the recombination would occur frequently. But in this case, the number of plumes when both are present is higher than when only the lysogenic is present. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to express, indicating that the lysogenic mutation is more recombinant.\n\nTo find the RF, let's consider the ratio of plumes. In the first group (more dilution), the number of plumes is 40, and in the second group (less dilution), it's 4. So the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination happened 10 times more often than not. But RF is usually given as a percentage, so 1/10 would imply a very low RF, like 0.1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nE. 0.02%\nF. 0.05%\nG. 0.1%\n\nSince the ratio is 10:1, which corresponds to a RF of approximately 0.1%, option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections occurred in each group.",
    "rollout": " So the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections occurred in each group.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial division. If the phages cause different outcomes, their presence might lead to some interference. Since the first group (1:10^7 dilution) shows more plumes on strain B than the second group (1:10^5), maybe the lower dilution allows for more frequent interactions or recombination events. Recombination would mean that the mutation from the lysogenic phage combines with the mutation from the lytic phage, leading to both effects. Each such event would create two plumes, one on each strain's lawn.\n\nNow, looking at the counts: 4 on K and 40 on B. Let's denote the number of recombination events as R. Each recombination creates two plumes, so the total plumes would be 2R + (number of non-recombinant events). In the first group, each plume either comes from a single phage or a combination. Similarly, in the second group.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected numbers under no recombination and then see what the observed data suggests. Without any recombination, all plumes would come from individual phages. However, if recombination occurs, some plumes would be from double phages, leading to two independent events.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the probability of recombination is higher because fewer cells are present. The second dilution has more cells, so the chance of recombination decreases. \n\nLet\u2019s calculate the expected number of plumes assuming recombination. Suppose there are R recombination events. Then, each recombination contributes two plumes (one on each strain), while each single-phage infection contributes one plume.\n\nThe total plumes would be 2R + (Total infections - R) = Total infections + R. Because for each phage, if it doesn't recombine, it produces one plume; if it recombines, it also produces another, but that's part of the same event.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nTotal plumes = Initial_infections + R\n\nFrom the experiment:\nGroup A (1:10^7): 4 plumes\nGroup B (1:10^5): 40 plumes\n\nAssuming the total number of phages in each group is N, then:\n\nFor Group A: 4 = N + R_A\nFor Group B: 40 = N + R_B\n\nWhere R_A is the number of recombinant events in Group A, and R_B in Group B.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach. The number of recombination events R relates to the difference in plume counts between the groups.\n\nSince Group A (lower dilution) has more plumes, it must have had more recombination events. Let's say R is the number of recombination events. Then, the number of plumes contributed by recombination would be 2R, because each recombination event leads to two plumes (one on each strain).\n\nIn Group A, the plumes include both single and double phage infections. So:\n\nPlumes in Group A = Single_plaques_A + Double_plaques_A\n\nSimilarly, in Group B:\n\nPlumes in Group B = Single_plaques_B + Double_plaques_B\n\nIf we assume that without recombination, all plumes are single infections, then the number of recombination events can be estimated as:\n\nR = (Plumes_A + Plumes_B - Total_infections) / 2\n\nBecause each recombination contributes two plumes, and the rest are single infections.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nEach recombination event accounts for two plumes. So the total plumes should equal the sum of single infections plus twice the number of recombination events.\n\nTotal plumes = Sum of single plauses in both groups + 2 * R\n\nGiven that, we can set up equations.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the ratio of plumes in the two groups gives us information about the likelihood of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s define p as the proportion of recombinant events. Then, in Group A (1:10^7), the probability of recombination is p, so the expected number of plumes would be influenced by p.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Group A, the number of plumes is 4, and in Group B, it's 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the effect of recombination reduces the number of plumes in Group B compared to Group A. Specifically, Group B has ten times as many plumes as Group A, indicating that recombination caused some of the plumes in Group B to be double events, thus reducing the overall count.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different angle. The number of recombination events can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (Number of plumes in Group A - Number of plumes in Group B) / (2)\n\nBecause each recombination event adds two plumes (one on each strain), and the difference between the two groups reflects the impact of recombination.\n\nSo,\n\nR = (4 - 40) / 2 = (-36)/2 = -18\n\nWait, negative number? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I inverted the groups. Perhaps Group B has fewer plumes, meaning more single infections, less recombination. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, Group A has fewer plumes (4) compared to Group B (40). If recombination happened, Group B would have fewer plumes because some of the plumes came from double events, making the total plumes less than if there were no recombination. So Group A has fewer plumes, implying less recombination, while Group B has more plumes, implying more recombination.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier assumption. Let me think again.\n\nNo, if recombination happens, Group A, which is lower in concentration (higher dilution), would have more plumes because some of the phages could recombine, increasing the number of plumes due to the additional event. Conversely, Group B, being higher concentration, would have fewer plumes because some double events reduce the total plumes.\n\nWait, now I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating the number of recombination events between two genes in phage systems.\n\nUpon recalling, the formula is R = (N_A * P_A + N_B * P_B) / (N_A + N_B) ), where N_A and N_B are the number of phages in each group, and P_A and P_B are the probabilities of recombination in each group.\n\nBut since the problem states that the two strains are E. coli B and K, and the phages are of different types, perhaps the number of recombination events can be determined by the difference in plume counts.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of plumes without recombination is proportional to the number of phages. With recombination, some plumes come from double events.\n\nThe number of recombination events R can be approximated by the difference in plume counts divided by the logarithm of the dilution factors.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler method is to use the fact that the log of the ratio of plume counts equals the recombination frequency multiplied by the dilution factor.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination can be estimated by comparing the observed plume distribution to the expected without recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the number of plumes should follow a Poisson distribution with lambda = number of phages. However, with recombination, some events overlap, affecting the counts.\n\nLooking back at the problem, four regions are divided: half (40%) is treated with 1:10^7, and the other half (60%) is treated with 1:10^5. On the 1:10^7 group, 4 plumes are found, and on the 1:10^5 group, 40 plumes.\n\nThis suggests that the treatment with 1:10^7 leads to fewer plumes, possibly because some double events reduce the total. Conversely, the treatment with 1:10^5 has more plumes, suggesting more single events.\n\nThe ratio of plumes between the treatments is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This implies that the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes in the higher concentration treatment.\n\nThe change in plume count can be attributed to the increase in dilution (from 1:10^7 to 1:10^5), which increases the likelihood of recombination. The decrease in plumes (from 40 to 4) suggests that recombination events reduced the total plumes by a factor of 10.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can take the reciprocal of the dilution factor between the treatments. The dilution factor is 10^5 / 10^7 = 1/100. Taking the natural log, ln(1/100) \u2248 -4.6. Dividing by the observed change in plumes (40 - 4 = 36), we get approximately -0.11. Exponentiating this gives e^-0.11 \u2248 0.899, which is close to 0.9, indicating a high level of recombination.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided go near 90%. The closest option is H (5%), but that seems too low given the significant drop in plumes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes in Group B to Group A is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would scale linearly with the number of phages, but with recombination, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for recombination frequency (R) can be derived from the equation:\n\nln(R) = ln(k) - (\u0394p) * (log(f))\n\nwhere \u0394p is the change in dilution, and k is the ratio of plume counts.\n\nBut I'm not confident about this approach. Another resource says that the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (1 - exp(-\u0394)) * 100%\n\nwhere \u0394 is the relative change in plume density.\n\nHere, \u0394 is (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) )= 36/44 \u2248 0.818. Then, R \u2248 (1 - exp(-0.818)) * 100% \u2248 (1 - 0.44) * 100% \u2248 56%.\n\nThat's around 56%, which isn't one of the options exactly. The closest is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A)/(plume_B + plume_A) * 100%.\n\nUsing the values:\n\n(40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818 \u2192 ~82%, which is still not matching any option. Alternatively, maybe it's R = (plume_B - plume_A)/(plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) ) * 100% = (36/44)*100% \u2248 81.8%. Still not matching.\n\nPerhaps instead, the correct formula considers the ratio of plume densities as a function of the dilution ratio. The formula for recombination frequency R is:\n\nR = (1 - exp(-\u0394)) * 100%\n\nwhere \u0394 = log(plume_B / plume_A) / log(dilution_ratio)\n\nHere, plume_B / plume_A = 40/4 = 10.\n\nDilution_ratio = 1e5 / 1e7 = 1e-2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394 = log(10) / log(1e-2) = 1 / (-2) = -0.5\n\nThen,\n\nR = (1 - exp(-(-0.5))) * 100% = (1 - exp(0.5)) * 100% \u2248 (1 - 1.6487) * 100% = negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I applied the formula incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the logarithm base 10 of the dilution ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) )\n\nWhich is the same as before, giving ~82%.\n\nBut again, not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes by the factor corresponding to the dilution. Since plume_B is 10 times plume_A, and the dilution increased by a factor of 100, the recombination frequency is approximately 1/log10(100) = 1/2 = 50%. So R \u2248 50%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). Hmm, 50% is much higher than those options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the number of recombination events R can be estimated as:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%\n\nAs before, this gives about 82%, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but that's the same thing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check another source. It says that the recombination frequency R can be calculated using:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%\n\nWhich is the same as above. So, with 4 and 40 plumes, R = (40 - 4)/(40 - 4 + 4) * 100% = 36/76 * 100% \u2248 47.4%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, which again is 36/76 \u2248 47.4%, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but this leads to 47.4%, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but this still doesn't give the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombination events R can be estimated by the difference in plume counts divided by the difference in dilution ratios. Given that, let's compute:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (log(dilution_B / dilution_A) - log(dilution_B / dilution_A))... No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%. Which again is 47.4%.\n\nBut given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different calculation. Maybe the number of recombination events is calculated as:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100% \u2192 47.4%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the closest is option D (0.1%).\n\nWait, that seems unlikely because 47% is much higher than 0.1%. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plume counts and recombination.\n\nAnother thought: The number of recombination events R can be approximated by the ratio of plume counts. Since plume_B is 10 times plume_A, and the dilution increased by a factor of 100, the number of recombination events might be related to the logarithm of the dilution factor. The dilution factor is 100, so log10(100) = 2. Therefore, R \u2248 1/2 = 0.5%, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The logarithm of the dilution factor (100) is 2, so R \u2248 1/2 = 0.5%. That matches option C.\n\nYes, I think that's the intended approach.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So the number of plumes indicates how many successful infections occurred in each group.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial division. If the phages cause different outcomes, their presence might lead to some interference. Since the first group (1:10^7 dilution) shows more plumes on strain B than the second group (1:10^5), maybe the lower dilution allows for more frequent interactions or recombination events. Recombination would mean that the mutation from the lysogenic phage combines with the mutation from the lytic phage, leading to both effects. Each such event would create two plumes, one on each strain's lawn.\n\nNow, looking at the counts: 4 on K and 40 on B. Let's denote the number of recombination events as R. Each recombination creates two plumes, so the total plumes would be 2R + (number of non-recombinant events). In the first group, each plume either comes from a single phage or a combination. Similarly, in the second group.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected numbers under no recombination and then see what the observed data suggests.

Then, each recombination contributes two plumes (one on each strain), while each single-phage infection contributes one plume.\n\nThe total plumes would be 2R + (Total infections - R) = Total infections + R. Because for each phage, if it doesn't recombine, it produces one plume; if it recombines, it also produces another, but that's part of the same event.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nTotal plumes = Initial_infections + R\n\nFrom the experiment:\nGroup A (1:10^7): 4 plumes\nGroup B (1:10^5): 40 plumes\n\nAssuming the total number of phages in each group is N, then:\n\nFor Group A: 4 = N + R_A\nFor Group B: 40 = N + R_B\n\nWhere R_A is the number of recombinant events in Group A, and R_B in Group B.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach. The number of recombination events R relates to the difference in plume counts between the groups.\n\nSince Group A (lower dilution) has more plumes, it must have had more recombination events. Let's say R is the number of recombination events. Then, the number of plumes contributed by recombination would be 2R, because each recombination event leads to two plumes (one on each strain).\n\nIn Group A, the plumes include both single and double phage infections.

Then, in Group A (1:10^7), the probability of recombination is p, so the expected number of plumes would be influenced by p.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Group A, the number of plumes is 4, and in Group B, it's 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the effect of recombination reduces the number of plumes in Group B compared to Group A. Specifically, Group B has ten times as many plumes as Group A, indicating that recombination caused some of the plumes in Group B to be double events, thus reducing the overall count.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.

Conversely, the treatment with 1:10^5 has more plumes, suggesting more single events.\n\nThe ratio of plumes between the treatments is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This implies that the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes in the higher concentration treatment.\n\nThe change in plume count can be attributed to the increase in dilution (from 1:10^7 to 1:10^5), which increases the likelihood of recombination. The decrease in plumes (from 40 to 4) suggests that recombination events reduced the total plumes by a factor of 10.\n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can take the reciprocal of the dilution factor between the treatments.

The formula for recombination frequency R is:\n\nR = (1 - exp(-\u0394)) * 100%\n\nwhere \u0394 = log(plume_B / plume_A) / log(dilution_ratio)\n\nHere, plume_B / plume_A = 40/4 = 10.\n\nDilution_ratio = 1e5 / 1e7 = 1e-2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394 = log(10) / log(1e-2) = 1 / (-2) = -0.5\n\nThen,\n\nR = (1 - exp(-(-0.5))) * 100% = (1 - exp(0.5)) * 100% \u2248 (1 - 1.6487) * 100% = negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I applied the formula incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the logarithm base 10 of the dilution ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) )\n\nWhich is the same as before, giving ~82%.\n\nBut again, not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes by the factor corresponding to the dilution. Since plume_B is 10 times plume_A, and the dilution increased by a factor of 100, the recombination frequency is approximately 1/log10(100) = 1/2 = 50%. So R \u2248 50%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). Hmm, 50% is much higher than those options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the number of recombination events R can be estimated as:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%\n\nAs before, this gives about 82%, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but that's the same thing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check another source. It says that the recombination frequency R can be calculated using:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%\n\nWhich is the same as above. So, with 4 and 40 plumes, R = (40 - 4)/(40 - 4 + 4) * 100% = 36/76 * 100% \u2248 47.4%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, which again is 36/76 \u2248 47.4%, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but this leads to 47.4%, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%, but this still doesn't give the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombination events R can be estimated by the difference in plume counts divided by the difference in dilution ratios. Given that, let's compute:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (log(dilution_B / dilution_A) - log(dilution_B / dilution_A))... No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100%. Which again is 47.4%.\n\nBut given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different calculation. Maybe the number of recombination events is calculated as:\n\nR = (plume_B - plume_A) / (plume_B - plume_A + plume_A) * 100% \u2192 47.4%, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the closest is option D (0.1%).\n\nWait, that seems unlikely because 47% is much higher than 0.1%. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plume counts and recombination.\n\nAnother thought: The number of recombination events R can be approximated by the ratio of plume counts. Since plume_B is 10 times plume_A, and the dilution increased by a factor of 100, the number of recombination events might be related to the logarithm of the dilution factor. The dilution factor is 100, so log10(100) = 2. Therefore, R \u2248 1/2 = 0.5%, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The logarithm of the dilution factor (100) is 2, so R \u2248 1/2 = 0.5%. That matches option C.\n\nYes, I think that's the intended approach.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

However, in reality, some colonies form because the lysogenic phage does cause some replication but doesn't lyse the cells. When both types are present, the combination leads to a higher number of infections on the strain B plate because the lysogenic phages are active, while the lytic ones don't contribute much. The difference between the two plates (40 vs. 4) indicates how many times the lysogenic phage was able to infect successfully in comparison to the lytic phage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut wait, I think another approach is needed here. Since the problem states that the lytic phage doesn't lyse the E. coli, but the lysogenic one does, perhaps the recombination refers to whether the mutation occurs in such a way that it allows the phage to replicate without lysing the host. Alternatively, maybe it's about how often the two mutations happened in the same phage instance.\n\nAnother method is to consider the dilution factors. The first plate is 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium has been exposed to 10^7 phages. The second plate is 1:10^5. The ratio of dilutions is 10^7 : 10^5, which simplifies to 100:1. If the two mutations are linked, the chance that a phage carrying both mutations will replicate and infect without lysing is increased. The observed number of plasmids on each plate compared to expectation gives insight into the likelihood of recombination.\n\nWait, let's think differently. In the first experiment, using only the lysogenic phage, most of the E. coli should die because the phage doesn't lyse. But in reality, some survive. The presence of recombination means that some of those survivors have both mutations. When both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the chances of survival beyond what would be expected from just using lysogenic alone.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, more lysogenic phages would cause death, leading to fewer colonies on the B plate. Conversely, lower recombination would mean lysogenic phages still replicate and kill their targets, again resulting in low B colonies. Here, since the B plate shows more colonies than expected (40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage caused more deaths, implying less recombination because recombination would reduce the number of dead phages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids detected on each plate relates inversely to the recombination rate. For example, if the two mutations are highly recombined (high recombination frequency), then more of the lysogenic phages would have both mutations, leading to higher death rates on the B plate. Wait, no\u2014high recombination would lead to more plasmids being lost as they lose the mutation, but in this case, the B plate had more colonies, indicating fewer dead phages, so possibly less recombination.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The formula for recombination frequency in genetic terms is R = (number of recombinants) / (total number of possible combinations). But in this context, we're dealing with bacterial genetics rather than simple DNA crosses.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio of the dilutions can help determine the likelihood of recombination. If the two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is higher. The observed difference in the number of plasmids on the two plates could indicate the fraction of phages that carry both mutations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- D1 = 1/10^7 (first dilution)\n- D2 = 1/10^5 (second dilution)\n\nThe expected number of plasmids per phage in D1 is proportional to the number of mutations carried. If recombination is high, the number of plasmids decreases. The observed difference between D1 and D2 can give us the fraction of phages that carry both mutations.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasmids on the B plate is proportional to the number of phages that caused death (i.e., lysed the host), then a higher number on the B plate would suggest more lysogenic phages, implying less recombination. Conversely, a lower number would imply more recombination.\n\nGiven that on the B plate, we have 40 plasmids, and on the K plate, 4, the ratio is 10:1. If the total number of phages is the sum of the two dilutions, say N_total = D1 + D2, then the expected number of plasmids would depend on the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, maybe the ratio of plasmids between the two plates can help estimate the recombination frequency.

Let\u2019s assume that under normal conditions (no recombination), the lysogenic phage would replicate and kill the host, resulting in maximum plasmids. With recombination, some phages carry both mutations and thus don\u2019t kill, reducing the number of plasmids.\n\nSo, if the number of plasmids on B is 40 and on K is 4, the ratio is 10:1.

Let\u2019s define F as the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plasmids per phage can be calculated as:\n\nE = (1 - F) * p + F * q,\n\nwhere p and q are the probabilities of having the mutation in each copy of the phage. However, this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on each plate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. On the B plate, 40 plasmids correspond to 1/10^7 dilution, and on the K plate, 4 plasmids correspond to 1/10^5 dilution. The ratio of plasmids is 40:4 = 10:1, which corresponds to the dilution factors 1/10^7 : 1/10^5 = 10:1. This suggests that the likelihood of recombination is high.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the highest recombination frequency mentioned is 5%, followed by 2%, etc. Since the ratio suggests a significant reduction in plasmids, but none of the options go up to 8%. The next closest is 5% (option G). Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on the B plate is 40, which is ten times higher than on the K plate (4), the recombination must be relatively high to explain why more lysogenic phages are causing death on the B plate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to calculate the probability of a phage carrying both mutations. The observed data (plasmids on each plate) can be used to infer this probability.\n\nSince on the B plate, 40 plasmids are found, and on the K plate, 4 are found, the ratio is 10:1. This implies that the likelihood of recombination is high enough to account for the difference in plasmid numbers between the two plates.\n\nGiven that, and looking at the answer choices, 5% seems plausible.

    "rollout": " So if there are more plumes on K than B, that might indicate something about the compatibility of the phage types.\n\nI remember that when two phages have recombined regions, their offspring may be less compatible with the host. This could affect how they replicate within the host cell. If the recombination is significant, the offspring might not integrate as well, leading to fewer successful infections. Alternatively, if they do recombine, maybe the new phage has lower fitness in the host. But wait, in this case, both types are present, and the effect seems pronounced on one strain more than the other.\n\nThe key here is probably the number of plumes observed. Since the phage with higher plumes (40 vs. 4) was plated on strain B, maybe the presence of this phage increased the likelihood of another phage causing issues on strain B. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate affects the probability of the phage successfully infecting the cells.\n\nWait, another approach is to think about the possible outcomes of crossing the two strains. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect certain numbers of plasmids. With recombination, the distribution would change. Specifically, when you cross two incompatible phages, the recombinant phage should have lower fitness in the host. However, in this case, we're observing different numbers of plumes on each strain. \n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating recombination frequency. It's often expressed as (number of recombinants)/(total number of test crosses), multiplied by 100%. In this scenario, the total number of test crosses is 40 (on B) plus 4 (on K), totaling 44. Out of these, 4 are on K. So the proportion is 4/44, which simplifies to approximately 9.09%, but wait, none of the options match exactly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, the difference between the two groups might relate to the recombination fraction. Another method is to calculate the expected number of recombinants under no recombination and compare it to what's observed. Without recombination, all offspring from the cross would be the same, but with recombination, some would differ. The observed numbers suggest a low level of recombination, perhaps even near zero.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option E is 0.02 percent and F is 0.3 percent. Given that 4 out of 44 is roughly 9%, which is much higher than any of these options, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the number of plumes on each strain relative to the total. So 4 on B and 40 on K, which adds up to 44. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That means for every 11 plumes, 1 goes to B and 10 go to K. Therefore, the probability of a phage being on B is 1/11, and on K is 10/11. This implies that there's a high chance of recombination, but the exact value isn't directly given by this.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. More plumes on K mean that K's strain was more likely to receive infections, suggesting that the phage on K is more compatible. But since the original phage caused problems in B but not K, the phage on K must be more compatible. How does recombination affect compatibility? Recombination might decrease compatibility, making the phage less effective in multiplying within the host. Thus, the presence of a recombinant phage (from the cross) would reduce its effectiveness, potentially increasing the likelihood of failure in infecting cells. But in this case, the plumes on K are higher, meaning K's strain was more likely to be hit, implying that the phage there is more compatible.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of successful combinations. Each time a phage from strain B crosses with a phage from strain K, the combination's success depends on whether they recombine. If they don't recombine, the phage may fail to infect as effectively. The higher number of plumes on K suggests that more of the cross resulted in infections. So if recombination occurred, it would make the offspring less effective, thus reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, without recombination, the offspring would be more effective, resulting in more plumes.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRecomb = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the total offspring are 40 + 4 = 44. Number of recombinants would be those where the phages recombine. If we assume that without recombination, all offspring are the same. If some recombine, then some will be recombinants.\n\nBut without knowing how many recombinants were observed, this is tricky. However, looking back, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage causes damage to E. coli strain B, while the wild-type phage doesn't. When both types are present, the E. coli B is mostly damaged. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more susceptible when paired with the wild-type, possibly due to recombination.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in the T4 region, and the wild-type also has a similar mutation, upon recombination, the offspring may have a different mutation profile. But if the lysogenic phage already has a mutation that makes it more problematic, pairing it with another phage that doesn't have the mutation could increase the risk of failure, hence more plumes on B.\n\nGiven the data, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. The total is 44. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. To find the recombination frequency, assuming that each recombination reduces the fitness, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the initial frequencies. However, without specific data on the parent strains' compatibility, it's challenging.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plumes relates to the number of phages that successfully integrated into the host genome. If recombination occurs, the offspring phages are less likely to integrate, leading to fewer successful infections. Thus, the more recombinants, the fewer plumes on the host. Here, B has more plumes, indicating fewer recombinations\u2014so lower recombination rate.\n\nCalculating the recombination frequency using the observed plumes: The probability of a phage being on B is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, and on K is 10/44 \u2248 22.73%. This suggests that there's a relatively low recombination rate, as the probability of a phage being on K is significantly higher than on B.\n\nNow, translating this into percentage points, 4% on B and 9.09% on K. Hmm, but the options don't include percentages like that. Instead, they provide small fractions. Perhaps the calculation requires using the ratios directly. For instance, the ratio of plumes on B to total gives the frequency. But I'm still unsure how to map this to the provided options.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If the number of plumes on B is four times that on K, that suggests that K's strain is more likely to receive the phage, meaning K's phage is more compatible. The ratio of 4:40 is 1:10, which could imply that the probability of a phage integrating into the genome is 1/11 for B and 10/11 for K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is 1/11, which is approximately 9.09%, but again, this isn't among the options.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the closest lower bound is option E (0.02%) and F (0.3%). My earlier assumption led me to believe that the recombination frequency is around 9%, which is way higher than any of these options. Maybe I've misapplied the concept. Perhaps instead, the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinant offspring, and the recombination frequency is calculated as the number of recombinants over the total, but adjusted by the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual recombination frequency is determined by comparing the occurrence of specific mutations. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it more damaging, and the wild-type doesn't, the presence of a recombinant phage would increase the likelihood of failure, hence more plumes on B. The ratio of plumes could give us information about the recombination rate. If 40 are on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests that the recombination happened once in every ten phage pairs. Converting that into a percentage, 1/(1+10) = 1/11 \u2248 9.09%, but again, this is not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for calculating the recombination frequency based on the observed number of recombinant offspring. The formula is:\n\nRecomb = (Number of recombinants / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nBut without knowing the number of recombinants, this is tricky. However, the problem says that the recombination leads to different plume counts. If 40 are on B and 4 on K, perhaps the recombination rate is such that the number of recombinants is 40 - 4 = 36. Then Recomb = (36 / 44)*100% \u2248 81.8%, which is even higher. This contradicts my previous reasoning.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me recall that in genetic crosses, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of parental to recombinant types. If the expected parental type is 44 and the recombinant is 0, but in our case, we have 40 on B and 4 on K, which suggests that the recombinant is 36. So the frequency is 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is close to 1. So the recombination frequency is almost complete, which would correspond to very high levels of recombination. But again, this doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that the number of plumes indicates the recombination events. Each plume corresponds to a recombination event. So 40 plumes on B and 4 on K would mean that there were 40 instances of recombination in the B group and 4 in the K group. The total number of possible recombination events is 44. Therefore, the recombination frequency is (40 + 4)/44 = 44/44 = 100%, which is impossible. So this line of thinking is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful combinations. Each time a recombination occurs, the offspring is a recombinant. So if 40 plumes appear on B and 4 on K, that suggests that 40 of the phages combined with their partners resulted in recombinant offspring, while 4 did not. Thus, the recombination frequency is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, which again is too high.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe I need to look at the options and see which one fits best. The answer choices are in percentages ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. Option D is 0.05%, E is 0.02%, F is 0.3%.\n\nSince the experiment showed that K had 4 plumes and B had 40, which is a 1:10 ratio, this suggests that the recombination rate is low, as only a few recombinant cases occurred. The number of plumes on B being much higher than on K suggests that the recombinant phages were infrequent, which would correspond to a low recombination frequency.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecomb = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total offspring) * 100%\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant offspring is the difference between the two groups, which is 40 - 4 = 36. So Recomb = (36 / 44) * 100% \u2248 81.8%, which is high, but that doesn't fit the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombinant frequency is low, say 5%, then 5% of 44 is 2.2, which is close to the 4 plumes on B. But 4 is double that, so maybe 10% would account for 4.4 plumes, which rounds to 4. So 10% recombination would explain the 4 plumes on B. But none of the answer choices go up to 10%.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 0.02% and F is 0.3%. These are the lowest. If the recombinant frequency is 0.02%, then 0.02% of 44 is 0.009, which rounds to 1 plume, but we saw 4 plumes on B. Similarly, 0.3% would be 0.132 plumes, which rounds to 1 plume. None of this matches the observed 4 plumes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinants. Since 40 are on B and 4 on K, the majority of the plumes are on B, implying that K's strain received more phages, meaning K's phages are more compatible. This could happen due to low recombination, but how does that translate into a percentage?\n\nAnother idea: The number of plumes increases when the recombination happens more frequently. If the recombination frequency is low, say 1%, then 1% of 44 is 0.44 plumes. Rounded to 0 or 1. But we have 4 plumes on B, which suggests a higher recombination rate. So perhaps the answer lies elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the recombination. If the recombination is rare, then the number of recombinant plumes would be low. But how do we quantify that? Maybe using the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of recombinants / Total) * 100%\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinants is the difference between the two groups, which is 40 - 4 = 36. So 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is high. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between the plumes and the recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes represents the number of recombinant offspring. Each time a recombination occurs, the offspring is a recombinant. So 40 plumes on B would indicate that 40 recombinants occurred when combining with the wild-type. Similarly, 4 on K would indicate 4 non-recombinants. So the total recombinants would be 40 - 4 = 36. But this doesn't help because 36/44 is still ~81.8%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination frequency. If 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, the recombination frequency is 40/(40+4) \u2248 87%. Again, this is too high.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Maybe I should consider that the presence of recombination explains why E. coli B is more affected when both mutants are present. If there's little recombination, the offspring phages wouldn't integrate, leading to more plumes. But in this case, we have more plumes on B, suggesting more recombination. However, the exact recombination frequency isn't clearly indicated by the data.\n\nGiven the answer choices, and considering that the correct answer is likely the lowest possible, option E (0.02%) or F (0.3%), I'll choose E as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are more plumes on K than B, that might indicate something about the compatibility of the phage types.\n\nI remember that when two phages have recombined regions, their offspring may be less compatible with the host. This could affect how they replicate within the host cell. If the recombination is significant, the offspring might not integrate as well, leading to fewer successful infections. Alternatively, if they do recombine, maybe the new phage has lower fitness in the host. But wait, in this case, both types are present, and the effect seems pronounced on one strain more than the other.\n\nThe key here is probably the number of plumes observed. Since the phage with higher plumes (40 vs. 4) was plated on strain B, maybe the presence of this phage increased the likelihood of another phage causing issues on strain B. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate affects the probability of the phage successfully infecting the cells.\n\nWait, another approach is to think about the possible outcomes of crossing the two strains. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect certain numbers of plasmids. With recombination, the distribution would change. Specifically, when you cross two incompatible phages, the recombinant phage should have lower fitness in the host. However, in this case, we're observing different numbers of plumes on each strain. \n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating recombination frequency. It's often expressed as (number of recombinants)/(total number of test crosses), multiplied by 100%. In this scenario, the total number of test crosses is 40 (on B) plus 4 (on K), totaling 44. Out of these, 4 are on K. So the proportion is 4/44, which simplifies to approximately 9.09%, but wait, none of the options match exactly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, the difference between the two groups might relate to the recombination fraction. Another method is to calculate the expected number of recombinants under no recombination and compare it to what's observed. Without recombination, all offspring from the cross would be the same, but with recombination, some would differ. The observed numbers suggest a low level of recombination, perhaps even near zero.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option E is 0.02 percent and F is 0.3 percent. Given that 4 out of 44 is roughly 9%, which is much higher than any of these options, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the number of plumes on each strain relative to the total. So 4 on B and 40 on K, which adds up to 44. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That means for every 11 plumes, 1 goes to B and 10 go to K. Therefore, the probability of a phage being on B is 1/11, and on K is 10/11. This implies that there's a high chance of recombination, but the exact value isn't directly given by this.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. More plumes on K mean that K's strain was more likely to receive infections, suggesting that the phage on K is more compatible. But since the original phage caused problems in B but not K, the phage on K must be more compatible. How does recombination affect compatibility? Recombination might decrease compatibility, making the phage less effective in multiplying within the host. Thus, the presence of a recombinant phage (from the cross) would reduce its effectiveness, potentially increasing the likelihood of failure in infecting cells. But in this case, the plumes on K are higher, meaning K's strain was more likely to be hit, implying that the phage there is more compatible.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of successful combinations. Each time a phage from strain B crosses with a phage from strain K, the combination's success depends on whether they recombine. If they don't recombine, the phage may fail to infect as effectively. The higher number of plumes on K suggests that more of the cross resulted in infections. So if recombination occurred, it would make the offspring less effective, thus reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, without recombination, the offspring would be more effective, resulting in more plumes.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRecomb = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, the total offspring are 40 + 4 = 44. Number of recombinants would be those where the phages recombine. If we assume that without recombination, all offspring are the same. If some recombine, then some will be recombinants.\n\nBut without knowing how many recombinants were observed, this is tricky. However, looking back, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage causes damage to E. coli strain B, while the wild-type phage doesn't. When both types are present, the E. coli B is mostly damaged. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more susceptible when paired with the wild-type, possibly due to recombination.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in the T4 region, and the wild-type also has a similar mutation, upon recombination, the offspring may have a different mutation profile. But if the lysogenic phage already has a mutation that makes it more problematic, pairing it with another phage that doesn't have the mutation could increase the risk of failure, hence more plumes on B.\n\nGiven the data, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. The total is 44. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. To find the recombination frequency, assuming that each recombination reduces the fitness, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the initial frequencies. However, without specific data on the parent strains' compatibility, it's challenging.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plumes relates to the number of phages that successfully integrated into the host genome. If recombination occurs, the offspring phages are less likely to integrate, leading to fewer successful infections. Thus, the more recombinants, the fewer plumes on the host. Here, B has more plumes, indicating fewer recombinations\u2014so lower recombination rate.\n\nCalculating the recombination frequency using the observed plumes: The probability of a phage being on B is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, and on K is 10/44 \u2248 22.73%. This suggests that there's a relatively low recombination rate, as the probability of a phage being on K is significantly higher than on B.\n\nNow, translating this into percentage points, 4% on B and 9.09% on K. Hmm, but the options don't include percentages like that. Instead, they provide small fractions. Perhaps the calculation requires using the ratios directly. For instance, the ratio of plumes on B to total gives the frequency. But I'm still unsure how to map this to the provided options.\n\nWait, let me think differently.

The ratio of 4:40 is 1:10, which could imply that the probability of a phage integrating into the genome is 1/11 for B and 10/11 for K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is 1/11, which is approximately 9.09%, but again, this isn't among the options.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the closest lower bound is option E (0.02%) and F (0.3%).

In the second case, both types have the mutation, so perhaps some integration has happened, causing the effect to be more pronounced.\n\nThe numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems like a significant difference. Maybe the ratio tells us about the likelihood of recombination. The dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5, so each group is quite small. The fact that K has fewer plumes might suggest less recombination because a lower number of plumes could indicate a higher chance of recombination. Alternatively, if the number of plumes increased, it might suggest more integration.\n\nWait, let me think again. If there's no recombination, then all the phages would have the same mutation, and the effect should be uniform across both strains. But in this case, strain B shows only the lysogenic phage's mutation, while strain K shows both. So maybe some integration has occurred, making some of the lysogenic phages carry the mutation as well, thus affecting strain B as well.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for expected recombinant offspring. Here, the observed recombinant plumes (on K) are 4, and the total possible recombinants would depend on the number of each type. However, without knowing the exact counts before crossing, it's tricky. Alternatively, the probability of recombination can be estimated based on the number of plumes. \n\nIf I consider that the presence of a recombination event increases the likelihood of a certain outcome, the decrease in the number of plumes on B compared to K might indicate a higher recombination rate. So, the 4 on K versus 40 on B implies that most of the phages have recombined, making the effect on strain B more likely.\n\nGiven the options provided, I need to pick the closest percentage. The answer choices go down to 0.02%. Since the effect is strong, indicating significant recombination, it's likely somewhere around 2% (Option B). This makes sense because the recombination would occur in a fraction of the cases, say around 2%, leading to the observed increase in plumes on K.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes indicate 40 successful infections on strain B, and 4 on strain K.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination here would mean that the two mutations interact, leading to a double mutant. Since only the lysogenic phage caused death, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that allows it to integrate with the T_4 genome. If they recombine, then during replication, the lysogenic phage could lose its T_4 DNA and gain the lysogenic DNA from another phage, preventing its death. However, if there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing T_4, leading to a higher chance of death than observed.\n\nLooking at the numbers, when both phages are present, more of the lysogenic phage survives (40 vs. 4), suggesting that the presence of the lytic phage (the one causing death) reduces the success rate of the lysogenic phage. This reduction implies that there is some degree of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Total Double Mutants - Total Single Mutants) / (Total Double Mutants + Total Single Mutants)\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the expected outcomes under complete independence versus actual outcomes. Under complete independence, the probability that a lysogenic phage survives when both phages are present would be equal to the product of their individual probabilities of survival.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P_Y = Probability lysogenic phage dies when only lysogenic.\n- P_X = Probability lysogenic phage dies when only phage X (lytic).\n- P_recomb = Probability recombination occurs, thus allowing the lysogenic phage to survive despite phage X's presence.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the observed number of plumes. If there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing T_4, so it would replicate successfully regardless of phage X. However, since in reality, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage only replicates 1/10th as often as when only phage X is present, indicating that recombination has occurred.\n\nSo, let's model this. Assume that in the absence of phage X, the lysogenic phage has a probability p of replicating successfully. In the presence of phage X, due to possible recombination, the probability becomes q. We observe that when both phages are present, the total number of successful infections on strain B is 40, while on strain K it's 4.\n\nIf there was no recombination, then p would be the same in all cases. However, with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose T_4 DNA upon replication, affecting its ability to infect. Therefore, when phage X is present, the lysogenic phage might have a lower probability of replicating successfully.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage can't replicate effectively if they recombine. Thus, the number of successful infections decreases.\n\nFrom the data: On strain B (with both phages), there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4 plumes. Since strain B is being plated on strain B's lawn, and strain K on its own, this suggests that the presence of the other strain affects the outcome. \n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is r, the expected number of double mutants (both phages causing death) would depend on r. However, given that only the lysogenic phage died when both were present, the presence of phage X likely allowed the lysogenic phage to lose T_4 DNA, hence reducing its replication efficiency.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can set up equations based on the observed data. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage has a certain kill rate, say k. With recombination, the kill rate increases. \n\nSuppose that when only phage X is present, the lysogenic phage has a kill rate of k. When both phages are present, due to recombination, the kill rate becomes k * m, where m is the ratio of recombination events to possible events. Given that the number of plumes decreased significantly, we can infer that m is less than 1.\n\nGiven the observed numbers, when both phages are present, the total number of successful infections on strain B is 40, and on strain K it's 4. Assuming that the total number of phages is proportional to the dilution factor, we can relate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of double mutants and single mutants, the recombination frequency r can be calculated as:\n\nr = (Double Mutant Count - Single Mutant Count) / (Double Mutant Count + Single Mutant Count)\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The key is that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently because of recombination. Therefore, its survival rate is reduced compared to when only phage X is present.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage replicates less successfully, leading to fewer plumes. The difference between the two conditions gives us information about the recombination fraction.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Without recombination: All lysogenic phages die, so no double mutant.\n- With recombination: Some lysogenic phages survive despite being replicated by phage X.\n\nWe observed 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Strain B is being plated on strain B's lawn, so any lysogenic phage that replicates without T_4 loss would cause a plume. Similarly, on strain K, only those phages that cause lysis would do so.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is ten times more likely to replicate successfully on strain B than on strain K. Why? Because when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage loses T_4 DNA and can't replicate effectively on strain K, whereas on strain B, it can replicate normally.\n\nTherefore, the recombination fraction r is such that the probability of survival is reduced by a factor of 10. Since survival probabilities multiply, r must satisfy (1 - r)^n = 1/10, where n is the number of potential sites for recombination. Assuming n=1 for simplicity, then (1 - r) \u2248 0.316, so r\u22480.684, which is over 68%, but this seems too high given the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. The observed ratio is 40:4, meaning 10:1 on B to K. If the presence of phage X (lytic) reduces the replication efficiency of lysogenic phages, then the ratio of survival rates would be proportional to the dilution factors or something else. Maybe the survival rate on strain B is higher because the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lose T_4 DNA there.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the equation:\n\n(1 - r) = (Number of double mutants)/(Total number of single mutants)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the presence of phage X causes a decrease in the number of double mutants relative to single mutants. The decrease is 40 - 4 = 36 double mutants per total of 44 single mutants. Therefore, (1 - r) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, so r\u22480.182, which is approximately 18%. But this still isn't matching any of the answer choices closely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the relationship between the number of plumes and the survival rates. If the number of plumes on strain B is 10 times more than on strain K, it suggests that the survival rate on B is 10 times higher. So, the ratio of surviving phages on B to K is 10:1. If survival is determined by the presence of recombination, then the survival rate is inversely related to the recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula for survival probability with recombination:\n\np = e^{-r}\n\nWhere r is the recombination fraction (probability of recombination occurring).\n\nThen, the survival ratio (on B to K) is e^{r} = 10.\n\nSolving for r: ln(10) \u2248 2.3026 \u21d2 r \u2248 2.3026%.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this value. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, which is much lower. Alternatively, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAnother way to think: The ratio of plumes is 10:1, so the likelihood of lysogenic phage replication is 10 times higher on B than on K. This suggests that the presence of phage X (lytic) reduces the replication efficiency of lysogenic phages by a factor of 10. If the survival rate is directly proportional to the recombination frequency, then r would be 90% (since 10% survival is 90% recombination?), but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n(Probability of failure on B) / (Probability of failure on K) = e^{-r}\n\nGiven that (failure on B) = 40/(total plumes on B) * N, similarly for K. But without knowing the total number of plumes, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, assuming the same dilution factor, the ratio of failures is 10:1, so e^{-r} = 10 \u21d2 r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3%, which isn't an option. Closest is E. 0.02%, which is 2%, close to 2.3%. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. If the number of plumes is proportional to the replication attempts, then the survival rate is proportional to e^{-r}. So if on B, the number of plumes is 10 times higher than on K, then the survival rate is 10 times higher, implying e^{-r} = 10 \u21d2 r \u2248 2.3%, which again is not an option. The closest is E. 0.02%, but that's much smaller.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the presence of phage X allows the lysogenic phage to lose T_4 DNA, making it less likely to replicate. If the lysogenic phage replicates with a probability proportional to (1 - r), then the ratio of plumes on B to K would be (1 - r_B)/(1 - r_K). Assuming r_B = r_K, then the ratio is 1:1, but in our case, it's 10:1. So perhaps r_B = r_K, but (1 - r_B) = 10*(1 - r_K). Solving this would give r_B = 0.02, which corresponds to option E.\n\nYes, that makes sense. If the lysogenic phage has a lower survival probability on strain B due to recombination, then the ratio of survival rates is 10:1. Assuming the recombination fraction is the same on both strains, we can write:\n\n1 - r = 10*(1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - r = 10 - 10r \u21d2 9r = 9 \u21d2 r = 1. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the survival ratios are inversely proportional to the recombination fractions. So if on B, the survival rate is S_B = e^{-r_B}, and on K, S_K = e^{-r_K}, and r_B = r_K + x, where x is the change due to recombination. But without knowing the exact relation, it's tricky.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach: If the number of plumes is 10:1, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more likely to replicate successfully on B than on K. Assuming the recombination fraction is the same on both, we can set up:\n\ne^{-r_B} = 10 * e^{-r_K}\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then e^{-r} = 10 * e^{-r}, which is impossible unless e^{-r}=0, which isn't correct. Therefore, the recombination fraction must differ between the two strains. But since the problem states that the two mutations are in the same T_4 genome, the recombination fraction should be the same on both. Hence, this approach leads to a contradiction, suggesting that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: The ratio of plumes indicates the likelihood of the lysogenic phage replicating without T_4 loss, which depends on the presence of recombination. If the presence of phage X reduces the replication efficiency, then the survival rate is lower on strain B, leading to more plumes. The ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. If the survival rate is proportional to the recombination frequency, then r = 1 - (40/44) = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is about 9%, but this isn't among the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should refer back to basic principles. The expected number of double mutants (both phages causing death) is given by N_double = N_single * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Here, N_single is the number of single mutants (lytic phage killing), and N_double is the number of double mutants. From the experiment, on strain B, the number of single mutants is 40, and on strain K, it's 4. So, N_single_B = 40, N_single_K = 4. Assuming that the number of single mutants on each strain is similar, except for the effect of recombination, which would reduce the number on one strain more than the other.\n\nWait, actually, when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate as efficiently on strain K because it loses T_4 DNA. Therefore, the number of single mutants on strain K would be higher than on strain B, since more phages would have lost T_4 DNA and thus replicate successfully. So, the observed numbers support that there is recombination.\n\nThe ratio of single mutants on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. If the recombination fraction is r, then the survival rates are related by (1 - r). If the presence of phage X causes a reduction in replication efficiency, then the survival rate on B is lower, leading to more single mutants on B. Conversely, on K, the survival rate is higher because the lysogenic phage doesn't lose T_4 DNA, so more phages replicate successfully, resulting in more single mutants on K. This contradicts the observed numbers unless recombination occurs, lowering the survival rate on B.\n\nThus, the ratio of single mutants is 10:1, which suggests that the survival rate is 10:1. Since survival rate is proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction, we have:\n\n(1 - r_B) / (1 - r_K) = 10\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then (1 - r)/ (1 - r) = 10 \u2192 1 = 10, which is impossible. Therefore, the recombination fractions must differ between the two strains. However, since the two mutations are in the same T_4 genome, the recombination frequency should be the same on both. Therefore, this scenario can't occur, suggesting an error in my reasoning.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate as efficiently on one strain, leading to fewer single mutants. If the ratio of single mutants is 10:1, then the survival rate on B is 10 times higher than on K, implying that the recombination frequency is such that (1 - r) = 10*(something). But without knowing the absolute values, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact fraction.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match to a small recombination frequency is D. 0.1 percent or E. 0.02 percent. Considering that the ratio is around 10:1, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 2.3%, but since this isn't an option, the next best choice is E. 0.02 percent, which is roughly a tenth of the required fraction. However, this seems low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the reciprocal of the ratio minus one. For example, if the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination frequency is (10 - 1)/10 = 0.9, but that also doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nr = 1 - (number of plumes on B / number of plumes on K)\n\nBut 40/4 = 10, so r = 1 - 10 = -9, which is obviously wrong.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different angle. The problem states that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently. The number of plumes increased on B (40) compared to K (4), suggesting that the presence of phage X caused a loss of T_4 DNA in the lysogenic phage, reducing its replication on K.\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 10:1, meaning that the survival rate on B is 10 times higher than on K. If survival is proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction, then:\n\n(1 - r_B) / (1 - r_K) = 10\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then 10 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, recombination must vary between the two strains, but since the two mutations are in the same genome, this shouldn't happen. Thus, the most plausible conclusion is that the recombination frequency is very low, leading to minimal difference in survival rates. Among the options, D. 0.1 percent and E. 0.02 percent are the lowest. However, the ratio is 10:1, which would require a higher recombination frequency.\n\nSince the available options don't include 2.3%, and the closest is E. 0.02%, which is much lower, I'll go with E. 0.02 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested around 2.3%, which is closer to option C. 1.5% or F. 0.3%. Option F is 0.3%, which is about three times higher than 0.02%. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the ratio should be considered differently.\n\nIf the number of plumes on B is 10 times higher than on K, that means the survival rate on B is 10 times higher. If survival rate is proportional to (1 - r), then:\n\n(1 - r_B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes indicate 40 successful infections on strain B, and 4 on strain K.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination here would mean that the two mutations interact, leading to a double mutant. Since only the lysogenic phage caused death, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that allows it to integrate with the T_4 genome. If they recombine, then during replication, the lysogenic phage could lose its T_4 DNA and gain the lysogenic DNA from another phage, preventing its death. However, if there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing T_4, leading to a higher chance of death than observed.\n\nLooking at the numbers, when both phages are present, more of the lysogenic phage survives (40 vs. 4), suggesting that the presence of the lytic phage (the one causing death) reduces the success rate of the lysogenic phage. This reduction implies that there is some degree of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Total Double Mutants - Total Single Mutants) / (Total Double Mutants + Total Single Mutants)\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the expected outcomes under complete independence versus actual outcomes. Under complete independence, the probability that a lysogenic phage survives when both phages are present would be equal to the product of their individual probabilities of survival.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P_Y = Probability lysogenic phage dies when only lysogenic.\n- P_X = Probability lysogenic phage dies when only phage X (lytic).\n- P_recomb = Probability recombination occurs, thus allowing the lysogenic phage to survive despite phage X's presence.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the observed number of plumes. If there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing T_4, so it would replicate successfully regardless of phage X. However, since in reality, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage only replicates 1/10th as often as when only phage X is present, indicating that recombination has occurred.\n\nSo, let's model this. Assume that in the absence of phage X, the lysogenic phage has a probability p of replicating successfully. In the presence of phage X, due to possible recombination, the probability becomes q. We observe that when both phages are present, the total number of successful infections on strain B is 40, while on strain K it's 4.\n\nIf there was no recombination, then p would be the same in all cases. However, with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose T_4 DNA upon replication, affecting its ability to infect. Therefore, when phage X is present, the lysogenic phage might have a lower probability of replicating successfully.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage can't replicate effectively if they recombine. Thus, the number of successful infections decreases.\n\nFrom the data: On strain B (with both phages), there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4 plumes. Since strain B is being plated on strain B's lawn, and strain K on its own, this suggests that the presence of the other strain affects the outcome. \n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is r, the expected number of double mutants (both phages causing death) would depend on r. However, given that only the lysogenic phage died when both were present, the presence of phage X likely allowed the lysogenic phage to lose T_4 DNA, hence reducing its replication efficiency.\n\nTo find the exact recombination frequency, we can set up equations based on the observed data. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage has a certain kill rate, say k. With recombination, the kill rate increases. \n\nSuppose that when only phage X is present, the lysogenic phage has a kill rate of k. When both phages are present, due to recombination, the kill rate becomes k * m, where m is the ratio of recombination events to possible events. Given that the number of plumes decreased significantly, we can infer that m is less than 1.\n\nGiven the observed numbers, when both phages are present, the total number of successful infections on strain B is 40, and on strain K it's 4. Assuming that the total number of phages is proportional to the dilution factor, we can relate the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of double mutants and single mutants, the recombination frequency r can be calculated as:\n\nr = (Double Mutant Count - Single Mutant Count) / (Double Mutant Count + Single Mutant Count)\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The key is that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently because of recombination. Therefore, its survival rate is reduced compared to when only phage X is present.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage replicates less successfully, leading to fewer plumes. The difference between the two conditions gives us information about the recombination fraction.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Without recombination: All lysogenic phages die, so no double mutant.\n- With recombination: Some lysogenic phages survive despite being replicated by phage X.\n\nWe observed 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Strain B is being plated on strain B's lawn, so any lysogenic phage that replicates without T_4 loss would cause a plume. Similarly, on strain K, only those phages that cause lysis would do so.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is ten times more likely to replicate successfully on strain B than on strain K. Why? Because when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage loses T_4 DNA and can't replicate effectively on strain K, whereas on strain B, it can replicate normally.\n\nTherefore, the recombination fraction r is such that the probability of survival is reduced by a factor of 10. Since survival probabilities multiply, r must satisfy (1 - r)^n = 1/10, where n is the number of potential sites for recombination. Assuming n=1 for simplicity, then (1 - r) \u2248 0.316, so r\u22480.684, which is over 68%, but this seems too high given the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. The observed ratio is 40:4, meaning 10:1 on B to K. If the presence of phage X (lytic) reduces the replication efficiency of lysogenic phages, then the ratio of survival rates would be proportional to the dilution factors or something else. Maybe the survival rate on strain B is higher because the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lose T_4 DNA there.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the equation:\n\n(1 - r) = (Number of double mutants)/(Total number of single mutants)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the presence of phage X causes a decrease in the number of double mutants relative to single mutants. The decrease is 40 - 4 = 36 double mutants per total of 44 single mutants. Therefore, (1 - r) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818, so r\u22480.182, which is approximately 18%. But this still isn't matching any of the answer choices closely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the relationship between the number of plumes and the survival rates. If the number of plumes on strain B is 10 times more than on strain K, it suggests that the survival rate on B is 10 times higher. So, the ratio of surviving phages on B to K is 10:1. If survival is determined by the presence of recombination, then the survival rate is inversely related to the recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula for survival probability with recombination:\n\np = e^{-r}\n\nWhere r is the recombination fraction (probability of recombination occurring).\n\nThen, the survival ratio (on B to K) is e^{r} = 10.\n\nSolving for r: ln(10) \u2248 2.3026 \u21d2 r \u2248 2.3026%.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this value. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, which is much lower. Alternatively, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAnother way to think: The ratio of plumes is 10:1, so the likelihood of lysogenic phage replication is 10 times higher on B than on K. This suggests that the presence of phage X (lytic) reduces the replication efficiency of lysogenic phages by a factor of 10. If the survival rate is directly proportional to the recombination frequency, then r would be 90% (since 10% survival is 90% recombination?), but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n(Probability of failure on B) / (Probability of failure on K) = e^{-r}\n\nGiven that (failure on B) = 40/(total plumes on B) * N, similarly for K. But without knowing the total number of plumes, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, assuming the same dilution factor, the ratio of failures is 10:1, so e^{-r} = 10 \u21d2 r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3%, which isn't an option. Closest is E. 0.02%, which is 2%, close to 2.3%. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. If the number of plumes is proportional to the replication attempts, then the survival rate is proportional to e^{-r}. So if on B, the number of plumes is 10 times higher than on K, then the survival rate is 10 times higher, implying e^{-r} = 10 \u21d2 r \u2248 2.3%, which again is not an option. The closest is E. 0.02%, but that's much smaller.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the presence of phage X allows the lysogenic phage to lose T_4 DNA, making it less likely to replicate. If the lysogenic phage replicates with a probability proportional to (1 - r), then the ratio of plumes on B to K would be (1 - r_B)/(1 - r_K). Assuming r_B = r_K, then the ratio is 1:1, but in our case, it's 10:1. So perhaps r_B = r_K, but (1 - r_B) = 10*(1 - r_K). Solving this would give r_B = 0.02, which corresponds to option E.\n\nYes, that makes sense. If the lysogenic phage has a lower survival probability on strain B due to recombination, then the ratio of survival rates is 10:1. Assuming the recombination fraction is the same on both strains, we can write:\n\n1 - r = 10*(1 - r)\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - r = 10 - 10r \u21d2 9r = 9 \u21d2 r = 1. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the survival ratios are inversely proportional to the recombination fractions. So if on B, the survival rate is S_B = e^{-r_B}, and on K, S_K = e^{-r_K}, and r_B = r_K + x, where x is the change due to recombination. But without knowing the exact relation, it's tricky.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach: If the number of plumes is 10:1, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more likely to replicate successfully on B than on K. Assuming the recombination fraction is the same on both, we can set up:\n\ne^{-r_B} = 10 * e^{-r_K}\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then e^{-r} = 10 * e^{-r}, which is impossible unless e^{-r}=0, which isn't correct. Therefore, the recombination fraction must differ between the two strains. But since the problem states that the two mutations are in the same T_4 genome, the recombination fraction should be the same on both. Hence, this approach leads to a contradiction, suggesting that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative idea: The ratio of plumes indicates the likelihood of the lysogenic phage replicating without T_4 loss, which depends on the presence of recombination. If the presence of phage X reduces the replication efficiency, then the survival rate is lower on strain B, leading to more plumes. The ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. If the survival rate is proportional to the recombination frequency, then r = 1 - (40/44) = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is about 9%, but this isn't among the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should refer back to basic principles. The expected number of double mutants (both phages causing death) is given by N_double = N_single * (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Here, N_single is the number of single mutants (lytic phage killing), and N_double is the number of double mutants. From the experiment, on strain B, the number of single mutants is 40, and on strain K, it's 4. So, N_single_B = 40, N_single_K = 4. Assuming that the number of single mutants on each strain is similar, except for the effect of recombination, which would reduce the number on one strain more than the other.\n\nWait, actually, when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate as efficiently on strain K because it loses T_4 DNA. Therefore, the number of single mutants on strain K would be higher than on strain B, since more phages would have lost T_4 DNA and thus replicate successfully. So, the observed numbers support that there is recombination.\n\nThe ratio of single mutants on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. If the recombination fraction is r, then the survival rates are related by (1 - r). If the presence of phage X causes a reduction in replication efficiency, then the survival rate on B is lower, leading to more single mutants on B. Conversely, on K, the survival rate is higher because the lysogenic phage doesn't lose T_4 DNA, so more phages replicate successfully, resulting in more single mutants on K. This contradicts the observed numbers unless recombination occurs, lowering the survival rate on B.\n\nThus, the ratio of single mutants is 10:1, which suggests that the survival rate is 10:1. Since survival rate is proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction, we have:\n\n(1 - r_B) / (1 - r_K) = 10\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then (1 - r)/ (1 - r) = 10 \u2192 1 = 10, which is impossible. Therefore, the recombination fractions must differ between the two strains. However, since the two mutations are in the same T_4 genome, the recombination frequency should be the same on both. Therefore, this scenario can't occur, suggesting an error in my reasoning.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate as efficiently on one strain, leading to fewer single mutants. If the ratio of single mutants is 10:1, then the survival rate on B is 10 times higher than on K, implying that the recombination frequency is such that (1 - r) = 10*(something). But without knowing the absolute values, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact fraction.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match to a small recombination frequency is D. 0.1 percent or E. 0.02 percent. Considering that the ratio is around 10:1, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 2.3%, but since this isn't an option, the next best choice is E. 0.02 percent, which is roughly a tenth of the required fraction. However, this seems low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the reciprocal of the ratio minus one. For example, if the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination frequency is (10 - 1)/10 = 0.9, but that also doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nr = 1 - (number of plumes on B / number of plumes on K)\n\nBut 40/4 = 10, so r = 1 - 10 = -9, which is obviously wrong.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different angle. The problem states that when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate efficiently. The number of plumes increased on B (40) compared to K (4), suggesting that the presence of phage X caused a loss of T_4 DNA in the lysogenic phage, reducing its replication on K.\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 10:1, meaning that the survival rate on B is 10 times higher than on K. If survival is proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction, then:\n\n(1 - r_B) / (1 - r_K) = 10\n\nAssuming r_B = r_K, then 10 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, recombination must vary between the two strains, but since the two mutations are in the same genome, this shouldn't happen. Thus, the most plausible conclusion is that the recombination frequency is very low, leading to minimal difference in survival rates. Among the options, D. 0.1 percent and E. 0.02 percent are the lowest. However, the ratio is 10:1, which would require a higher recombination frequency.\n\nSince the available options don't include 2.3%, and the closest is E. 0.02%, which is much lower, I'll go with E. 0.02 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested around 2.3%, which is closer to option C. 1.5% or F. 0.3%. Option F is 0.3%, which is about three times higher than 0.02%. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the ratio should be considered differently.\n\nIf the number of plumes on B is 10 times higher than on K, that means the survival rate on B is 10 times higher. If survival rate is proportional to (1 - r), then:\n\n(1 - r_B",

Similarly, 40 on B indicate more infections.\n\nI think the key here is the concept of recombinant systems. When two different phages cause different outcomes when mixed, you get a recombinant phage that has parts from both. In this case, the lysogenic phage would cause lysing, while the lytic would cause lysis. If they recombine, you might have a phage that behaves like either or neither, depending on where the break occurs.\n\nThe number of plasmids detected on each lawn depends on how much of each type was present. Dilution affects the concentration. Plating on strain B for the first half, which is at 1:10^7 dilution, so each bacterium would carry about 0.0000001 phages. Then, plating on strain K at 1:10^5 dilution means each bacterium carries 0.0001 phages. \n\nIf the recombination is happening, then the presence of multiple phages in the same region could lead to interference or some sort of competition, affecting the outcome. However, since only some cells show infection, maybe the recombination isn't complete, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that when both types of phage are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, possibly due to recombination. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated inside the lysogen, leading to more replication events.\n\nBut focusing on the plasmid counts: On K's lawn, there are 4 plumes, meaning 4 plasmid copies per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes, meaning 40 plasmid copies per bacterium. Since the plating on K is at a higher dilution (1:10^5 vs. 1:10^7), the number of plasmids detected should be proportional to the total number of phages in the population. So the actual number in the population would be higher on the K plate because fewer were plated. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of plasmids detected depends on the dilution factor. For example, if you plate N plasmids at a 1:10^n dilution, you detect N * 10^n plasmids. So if you have 4 plumes on K's lawn, that's 4 * 10^5 = 40,000 plasmids per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes mean 40 * 10^7 = 4,000,000 plasmids per bacterium. \n\nNow, the total phage load on the K plate is 40,000 plasmids per bacterium, and on B's plate, it's 4,000,000. This indicates that the K plate has a lower density of phages compared to the B plate. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage is responsible for more infections, perhaps its presence leads to more efficient replication within the lysogen, increasing the number of phages available to lyse the E. coli. However, the exact relationship between the numbers and the recombination rate needs to be considered.\n\nIn recombinant systems, the efficiency of phage replication can sometimes increase, allowing more phages to replicate within the lysogen, thereby increasing the probability of lysing the E. coli. If there's significant recombination, the lysogenic phage might be partially lost, but in this case, the strain B is mainly affected, suggesting that recombination hasn't completely removed the lysogenic effect.\n\nAnother angle is considering the interference during plating. Interference reduces the detection of additional phages because they compete for the same sites. If the lysogenic phage had a lot of recombination, maybe the interference is less, leading to more plasmids detected. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the number of plasmids, the K plate has 40,000 plasmids per bacterium, and B has 4,000,000. The ratio is 1:100. That suggests that the phage load on K is 1% of B's. If the lysogenic phage caused more damage, perhaps due to incomplete dissociation, the presence of more plasmids would suggest more active replication.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage usually has a longer life cycle and doesn't lyse the cell upon replication. If the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, maybe it's because it's being replicated within the lysogen, leading to increased activity. However, the presence of more plasmids on K suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating more efficiently within the lysogen.\n\nBut how does recombination fit into this? Recombination would affect the distribution of plasmids, potentially altering their efficiency. If the lysogenic phage has a certain degree of recombination, maybe it's less likely to lyse the E. coli, but more likely to cause lysis through partial replication. But in this case, the lysogenic phage seems to be more effective, leading to more plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage may lose some activity, making it more susceptible to lytic fission. But the problem says only lysogenic causes more damage. Hmm.\n\nMaybe instead of focusing on the plasmid count, I should consider the probability of recombination. The expected number of recombinants can influence the observed outcome. If the recombination is high, the lysogenic phage might have higher chances of interacting with the lysogen, leading to more plasmids. But without specific data on the mutation rates or the likelihood of recombination, it's tricky.\n\nWait, another approach: The recombination frequency (RF) is often calculated as the number of recombinant chromosomes divided by the total number of chromosomes. But here, we're dealing with a genome region, so it's a bit different. Maybe the fraction of double crossovers relates to the recombination rate. But again, without knowing the exact number of double crossovers, it's hard to apply.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the plasmid levels: On K's lawn, 4 plumes, which is 40,000 plasmids per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes, which is 4,000,000 plasmids per bacterium. The ratio is 1:100. If the lysogenic phage had a certain level of recombination, maybe the number of plasmids increases because more phages are present due to the ability of recombined phages to integrate better into the lysogen, thus replicating more effectively.\n\nSo the number of plasmids on K is 1/100th of B. If recombination occurred, perhaps the lysogenic phage loses some activity, making it easier for them to replicate within the lysogen. But in this case, the lysogenic phage still causes damage, so maybe the recombination isn't too high.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. It's asking for the percentage of recombination, probably expressed as a fraction of possible recombinants.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of double crossovers would be related to R. But without knowing the total number of potential crossover points, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids corresponds to the number of successful recombination events. Each recombination event could contribute to the formation of new phage genomes. If the lysogenic phage underwent a certain number of recombination events, it could explain the difference in plasmid counts.\n\nGiven that the K plate has 1/100th the plasmids, perhaps the recombination rate is low, say 1%. Because 1% of double crossovers would reduce the total number of phages by about 1%, resulting in a 1% decrease in plasmid count. Or perhaps the opposite: if the recombination rate is high, it would increase the number of phages.\n\nWait, no. More recombination would lead to more double crossovers, which might disrupt the phage genome, reducing the effective number of phages. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, so maybe the recombination isn't high enough to reduce the activity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids reflects the number of successful integration events. Each recombination could allow a new phage genome to form, increasing the number of phages. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is still causing damage, so perhaps the recombination isn't very high.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices: A.1%, B.2%, C.1.5%, D.0.1%, E.0.2%.\n\nSince the K plate has 1/100th the plasmids, the recombination must be low. 1% makes sense because 1% of double crossovers would reduce the number of phages by about 1%, matching the observed 1:100 ratio. Therefore, the recombination rate is approximately 1%.\n\nWait, but the options include 0.5%, 0.2%, etc. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, the number of phages would depend on R squared, assuming independent assortment. But I don't know the total number of crossovers. Without that information, it's hard to calculate R accurately. However, given the small ratio of 1:100, it's reasonable to assume that R is around 1%, so the correct answer is A.1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Then, plating on strain K at 1:10^5 dilution means each bacterium carries 0.0001 phages. \n\nIf the recombination is happening, then the presence of multiple phages in the same region could lead to interference or some sort of competition, affecting the outcome. However, since only some cells show infection, maybe the recombination isn't complete, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that when both types of phage are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, possibly due to recombination. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated inside the lysogen, leading to more replication events.\n\nBut focusing on the plasmid counts: On K's lawn, there are 4 plumes, meaning 4 plasmid copies per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes, meaning 40 plasmid copies per bacterium. Since the plating on K is at a higher dilution (1:10^5 vs. 1:10^7), the number of plasmids detected should be proportional to the total number of phages in the population. So the actual number in the population would be higher on the K plate because fewer were plated. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of plasmids detected depends on the dilution factor. For example, if you plate N plasmids at a 1:10^n dilution, you detect N * 10^n plasmids. So if you have 4 plumes on K's lawn, that's 4 * 10^5 = 40,000 plasmids per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes mean 40 * 10^7 = 4,000,000 plasmids per bacterium. \n\nNow, the total phage load on the K plate is 40,000 plasmids per bacterium, and on B's plate, it's 4,000,000. This indicates that the K plate has a lower density of phages compared to the B plate. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage is responsible for more infections, perhaps its presence leads to more efficient replication within the lysogen, increasing the number of phages available to lyse the E. coli. However, the exact relationship between the numbers and the recombination rate needs to be considered.\n\nIn recombinant systems, the efficiency of phage replication can sometimes increase, allowing more phages to replicate within the lysogen, thereby increasing the probability of lysing the E. coli. If there's significant recombination, the lysogenic phage might be partially lost, but in this case, the strain B is mainly affected, suggesting that recombination hasn't completely removed the lysogenic effect.\n\nAnother angle is considering the interference during plating. Interference reduces the detection of additional phages because they compete for the same sites. If the lysogenic phage had a lot of recombination, maybe the interference is less, leading to more plasmids detected. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the number of plasmids, the K plate has 40,000 plasmids per bacterium, and B has 4,000,000. The ratio is 1:100. That suggests that the phage load on K is 1% of B's. If the lysogenic phage caused more damage, perhaps due to incomplete dissociation, the presence of more plasmids would suggest more active replication.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage usually has a longer life cycle and doesn't lyse the cell upon replication. If the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, maybe it's because it's being replicated within the lysogen, leading to increased activity. However, the presence of more plasmids on K suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating more efficiently within the lysogen.\n\nBut how does recombination fit into this? Recombination would affect the distribution of plasmids, potentially altering their efficiency. If the lysogenic phage has a certain degree of recombination, maybe it's less likely to lyse the E. coli, but more likely to cause lysis through partial replication. But in this case, the lysogenic phage seems to be more effective, leading to more plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage may lose some activity, making it more susceptible to lytic fission. But the problem says only lysogenic causes more damage. Hmm.\n\nMaybe instead of focusing on the plasmid count, I should consider the probability of recombination. The expected number of recombinants can influence the observed outcome. If the recombination is high, the lysogenic phage might have higher chances of interacting with the lysogen, leading to more plasmids. But without specific data on the mutation rates or the likelihood of recombination, it's tricky.\n\nWait, another approach: The recombination frequency (RF) is often calculated as the number of recombinant chromosomes divided by the total number of chromosomes. But here, we're dealing with a genome region, so it's a bit different. Maybe the fraction of double crossovers relates to the recombination rate. But again, without knowing the exact number of double crossovers, it's hard to apply.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the plasmid levels: On K's lawn, 4 plumes, which is 40,000 plasmids per bacterium. On B's lawn, 40 plumes, which is 4,000,000 plasmids per bacterium. The ratio is 1:100. If the lysogenic phage had a certain level of recombination, maybe the number of plasmids increases because more phages are present due to the ability of recombined phages to integrate better into the lysogen, thus replicating more effectively.\n\nSo the number of plasmids on K is 1/100th of B. If recombination occurred, perhaps the lysogenic phage loses some activity, making it easier for them to replicate within the lysogen. But in this case, the lysogenic phage still causes damage, so maybe the recombination isn't too high.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. It's asking for the percentage of recombination, probably expressed as a fraction of possible recombinants.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of double crossovers would be related to R. But without knowing the total number of potential crossover points, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids corresponds to the number of successful recombination events. Each recombination event could contribute to the formation of new phage genomes. If the lysogenic phage underwent a certain number of recombination events, it could explain the difference in plasmid counts.\n\nGiven that the K plate has 1/100th the plasmids, perhaps the recombination rate is low, say 1%. Because 1% of double crossovers would reduce the total number of phages by about 1%, resulting in a 1% decrease in plasmid count. Or perhaps the opposite: if the recombination rate is high, it would increase the number of phages.\n\nWait, no. More recombination would lead to more double crossovers, which might disrupt the phage genome, reducing the effective number of phages. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing more damage, so maybe the recombination isn't high enough to reduce the activity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids reflects the number of successful integration events. Each recombination could allow a new phage genome to form, increasing the number of phages. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is still causing damage, so perhaps the recombination isn't very high.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices: A.1%, B.2%, C.1.5%, D.0.1%, E.0.2%.\n\nSince the K plate has 1/100th the plasmids, the recombination must be low. 1% makes sense because 1% of double crossovers would reduce the number of phages by about 1%, matching the observed 1:100 ratio. Therefore, the recombination rate is approximately 1%.\n\nWait, but the options include 0.5%, 0.2%, etc. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, the number of phages would depend on R squared, assuming independent assortment. But I don't know the total number of crossovers. Without that information, it's hard to calculate R accurately. However, given the small ratio of 1:100, it's reasonable to assume that R is around 1%, so the correct answer is A.1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "chunk_removed": "So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages have successfully taken up the DNA.",
    "rollout": " So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages have successfully taken up the DNA. Similarly, 40 on B mean 40 phages have taken up the DNA in that half. \n\nNow, the total number of phages introduced into each half would be important here. In the first half, they're diluting at 1:10^7, meaning for every 1 phage, 10^7 cells are plated. Since each phage infects a cell, the number of phages per cell is 1e-7. However, because we're dealing with a large number of cells, maybe I should think in terms of dilution factors affecting the expected number of infections. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expected number of infections during plating. The expected number (E) is given by E = N * p, where N is the number of plating units, and p is the probability of infection per unit. Here, N would be the dilution factor, so for 1:10^7, N=1e7. Then E = 1e7 * p. \n\nIn the first half, they plate on strain B's lawn. Only some of the phages will cause lytic fission, so those won't take up the DNA. Therefore, the number of phages that actually take up the DNA and cause infection depends on the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are recombined, then the chance that a phage carries both mutations is higher than if they didn't. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when the two phages interact, they may exchange genetic material, leading to recombinant mutations. This could affect whether the phage takes up the DNA or not. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate without causing lysis, and the wild-type phage has another mutation that prevents integration, their combination might lead to recombinants that either don't take up the DNA or do, depending on the specific interactions. \n\nSo in the first half, which is plated on strain B's lawn, the phages from the first half are more likely to cause lysis, so fewer would take up the DNA. Those that don't lyse would be the ones that carry the lysogenic phage's mutation. On the second half, which is plated on strain K's lawn, any phages that carry a recombined mutation would take up the DNA, while others wouldn't. \n\nGiven that in the first half, after dilution, the number of plumes (infections) is much lower compared to the second half, it implies that the presence of recombination affects the likelihood of infection. Specifically, the recombination frequency determines how often a phage successfully integrates the new mutation. \n\nThe problem states that only E. coli strain B was affected, suggesting that most of the phages caused lysis. Now, when both mutant types are present, the effect on strain B is such that only 40% of the phages took up the DNA (since 40/100 = 0.4), whereas on strain K, only 1% took up the DNA (since 4/100 = 0.04). Wait, no, wait: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K? Wait, no, the user wrote: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So on strain B's half, you get 4 plumes (40%), and on strain K's half, you get 40 plumes (40%). \n\nBut wait, the original statement says: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So yes, 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems contradictory. Because if strain B is mostly affected, it should have more infections. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood. Wait, the initial description says: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So on strain B's half, 40 plumes, and on strain K's half, 4 plumes. But the question says four plaques on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems inverted. Maybe I got it wrong. Let me read again: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo, on strain B's half, 40 plumes; on strain K's half, 4 plumes. So strain B is mostly affected, as expected. Now, what matters is how the presence of recombination affects the probabilities. If there is complete recombination, all phages would take up the DNA, but that's probably not the case here. Instead, the observed frequencies indicate that the recombination rate is such that on strain B's half, the probability is 40%, and on strain K's half, it's 1%. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expectation value is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Let's denote the probability of the lysogenic phage taking up the DNA as p, and the wild-type phage as q. But due to recombination, the actual probability that a phage carries both mutations is r. \n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present, it can only cause lysis, so the probability of infection is zero. When only the wild-type is present, the probability of infection is also zero, assuming no recombination. But when both are present, the probability becomes non-zero. \n\nIn the first half, which is plated on strain B's lawn, the phages from the first half are less likely to take up the DNA, so the number of plumes is low. Conversely, in the second half, which is plated on strain K's lawn, the phages from the second half are more likely to take up the DNA because strain K's phages are different. \n\nGiven that on strain B's half, 40% of the phages took up the DNA (plumes), and on strain K's half, only 1% did, we can model this. Let\u2019s assume that the presence of recombination reduces the effective probability of infection. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is R * p * q. Without recombination, p = q = 1, so the probability would be 1*1 = 1, which isn't possible. Actually, recombination would reduce this probability. \n\nLet\u2019s set up equations. Let\u2019s say that without recombination, the probability of a phage taking up the DNA is p for both types. With recombination, the probability becomes R*p*q, where R is the recombination frequency. But since p and q are independent, and under recombination, the combined probability is R*p*q. \n\nHowever, if the two mutations are linked, then the occurrence of one mutation affects the probability of the other. So the actual probability might be R*p*(1 - p), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of recombination increases the chance that a phage can integrate both mutations, thus reducing the chance of lysis. Therefore, the probability of infection decreases because the phage is more likely to integrate the new mutation, making it easier to cause lysis. \n\nSo, in the first half, where only the lysogenic phage is present, the probability of infection is zero. In the second half, where both types are present, the probability is non-zero. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP_infect = P_Y lysogenic + P_X wild-type + P_both\n\nWhere P_both is the probability that both mutations are present in the phage. \n\nAssuming that P_Y lysogenic doesn\u2019t take up the DNA, P_X wild-type doesn\u2019t take up the DNA, and P_both does. \n\nWithout recombination, P_both would be zero, so P_infect = 0. But with recombination, P_both increases. \n\nIn the first half, the only source of infection is P_both. So:\n\nP_infect_half1 = P_both * (probability of integrating both mutations)\n\nSimilarly, in the second half:\n\nP_infect_half2 = P_both * (probability of integrating both mutations)\n\nBut the presence of recombination affects the overall probability. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of interference. If recombination occurs, the events are not independent. \n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\np = probability that the lysogenic phage takes up the DNA.\n\nq = probability that the wild-type phage takes up the DNA.\n\nWith recombination, the probability that both take up the DNA is r = p * q * e^{-(distance)}, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if the two mutations are close enough, the probability that both occur is approximately p * q * (1 - d/(10^n)), where d is the distance in base pairs. But without knowing the exact distance, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the expected number of plasmids in each half is equal to the product of the dilution factor and the probability of integration. \n\nFor the first half (plated on strain B):\n\nE1 = (1e7) * p * q * r\n\nBut since p and q are both 1 (assuming no recombination initially), E1 = 1e7 * r. \n\nOn strain K's half:\n\nE2 = (1e5) * p * q * r\n\nAgain, E2 = 1e5 * r.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nOn strain B's half, 4 plumes occurred, which correspond to E1 = 4. So:\n\n1e7 * r = 4 => r = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7.\n\nOn strain K's half, 40 plumes occurred, so:\n\n1e5 * r = 40 => r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. Perhaps because the presence of recombination affects both halves differently. Alternatively, maybe the recombination occurs independently in each half.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to treat the two halves separately. Each half has its own probability of recombination. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nr1 = recombination frequency in the first half (plated on B).\n\nr2 = recombination frequency in the second half (plated on K).\n\nWe need to find the average recombination frequency across both halves, but the problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, which I think refers to the overall recombination rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is measured as the percentage of cross-phage recombinases that have integrated both mutations. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe another approach: the observed plasmid density after dilution relates to the actual recombination rate. Let\u2019s assume that the expected number of plasmids in each half is proportional to the dilution factor times the recombination rate.\n\nFor the first half:\n\nAfter dilution 1:1e7, the expected number of plasmids is N1 = (1e7) * r.\n\nN1 = 4 (plumes found), so:\n\n1e7 * r = 4 => r = 4e-7.\n\nFor the second half:\n\nAfter dilution 1:1e5, the expected number of plasmids is N2 = (1e5) * r.\n\nN2 = 40 (plumes found), so:\n\n1e5 * r = 40 => r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nWait, this gives two different values for r, which is impossible unless the recombination rates differ between the halves. But that contradicts the idea that recombination is a global phenomenon. Therefore, perhaps the assumption that the expected number of plasmids equals the observed count is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the observed counts include background noise, but the key is that the ratio of plasmids between the two halves reflects the difference in dilution factors. \n\nGiven that on strain B's half, the plasmid density is 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7, and on strain K's half, it's 40 / 1e5 = 0.4. The ratio is 4e-7 : 0.4, which simplifies to 1 : 1e8. That suggests that the plasmid density is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, which is consistent with the square-root rule in horizontal gene transfer, where the transfer efficiency is proportional to sqrt(dilution factor). \n\nBut back to the recombination rate. If the same recombination rate applies to both halves, then both ratios should give the same r. But they don't. Therefore, perhaps the recombination rate varies between the two halves, indicating incomplete recombination. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is calculated as the harmonic mean or geometric mean of the two rates, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed plasmid densities are influenced by both the recombination rate and the presence of multiple phages. Let's think about the overall process. \n\nEach time a phage integrates, it can carry both mutations. The probability that a phage carries both mutations is r. The expected number of plasmids in each half is then:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r * (1 - s),\n\nwhere s is the selection coefficient against carrying both mutations. But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plasmids would depend on the probability of integration, which includes the chance of crossing over. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed plasmid densities. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nf = recombination frequency (as a fraction).\n\nThen, the expected number of plasmids in each half is:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * f,\n\nE2 = (1e5) * f.\n\nBut according to the experiments:\n\nE1 = 4,\n\nE2 = 40.\n\nSo,\n\n1e7 * f = 4 => f = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7 \u2248 4e-7.\n\nAnd,\n\n1e5 * f = 40 => f = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nThese two values are inconsistent, which suggests that the recombination frequency is not uniform across both halves. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nSince E1/E2 = (1e7)/(1e5) = 100. Also, E1/E2 = (4)/40 = 0.1.\n\nTherefore, 100 = 0.1, which is clearly not true. Hence, the recombination frequency must vary between the two halves. \n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the entire T_4 genome. It doesn't specify whether it's the average or the maximum. Given that, perhaps the overall recombination rate is determined by the sum or product of the individual recombination rates, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two halves are divided equally in terms of dilution, but the plasmid densities are different, perhaps the overall recombination rate is related to the harmonic mean or geometric mean of the two rates. \n\nThe harmonic mean of 4e-7 and 0.4 is 2 / (1/(4e-7) + 1/0.4)^(-1) = ... Let's compute it:\n\nCompute 1/(4e-7) \u2248 2.5e6,\n\n1/0.4 = 2.5,\n\nSum \u2248 2.5e6 + 2.5 \u2248 2.5e6,\n\nReciprocal \u2248 4e-6,\n\nWhich is 0.0004%, but that seems too small.\n\nAlternatively, the geometric mean is sqrt(4e-7 * 0.4) = sqrt(1.6e-7) \u2248 4e-4, which is 0.04%, still very small.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match the options provided. The options are in the range of 0.01% to 0.5%.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the observed plasmid density on each half is proportional to the product of the dilution factor and the recombination rate. So:\n\nOn B: (1e7) * r = 4 \u2192 r = 4e-7.\n\nOn K: (1e5) * r = 40 \u2192 r = 0.4.\n\nBut again, these are inconsistent. So perhaps the recombination rate is the same for both halves, but the observed counts are lower or higher due to selection.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of plasmids affects the growth, so some plasmids are selected against. Let's model this. Suppose that the selection coefficient against carrying both mutations is s. Then, the expected number of plasmids in each half would be:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r * (1 - s),\n\nE2 = (1e5) * r * (1 - s).\n\nGiven that E1 = 4 and E2 = 40,\n\nDividing E1/E2 = (1e7 * r * (1 - s)) / (1e5 * r * (1 - s)) ) = 100 = 40 / 4 \u21d2 100 = 10, which is not correct. Thus, this suggests that the selection coefficient is such that the plasmid density is lower than expected. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is determined by the ratio of plasmid densities. Let\u2019s consider that the plasmid density in each half is inversely proportional to the dilution factor multiplied by the recombination rate. \n\nThus,\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r = 4,\n\nE2 = (1e5) * r = 40,\n\nBut solving these gives different r values. To reconcile this, perhaps the plasmid density is proportional to the product of dilution factor and recombination rate, but adjusted by a factor accounting for selection. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nE1 = k * (1e7) * r,\n\nE2 = k * (1e5) * r,\n\nWhere k is a constant that adjusts for selection. From E1 = 4 and E2 = 40,\n\nk * (1e7) * r = 4,\n\nk * (1e5) * r = 40.\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n(k * 1e5 * r) / (k * 1e7 * r) ) =",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages have successfully taken up the DNA. Similarly, 40 on B mean 40 phages have taken up the DNA in that half. \n\nNow, the total number of phages introduced into each half would be important here. In the first half, they're diluting at 1:10^7, meaning for every 1 phage, 10^7 cells are plated. Since each phage infects a cell, the number of phages per cell is 1e-7. However, because we're dealing with a large number of cells, maybe I should think in terms of dilution factors affecting the expected number of infections. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expected number of infections during plating. The expected number (E) is given by E = N * p, where N is the number of plating units, and p is the probability of infection per unit. Here, N would be the dilution factor, so for 1:10^7, N=1e7. Then E = 1e7 * p. \n\nIn the first half, they plate on strain B's lawn. Only some of the phages will cause lytic fission, so those won't take up the DNA. Therefore, the number of phages that actually take up the DNA and cause infection depends on the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are recombined, then the chance that a phage carries both mutations is higher than if they didn't. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when the two phages interact, they may exchange genetic material, leading to recombinant mutations. This could affect whether the phage takes up the DNA or not. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate without causing lysis, and the wild-type phage has another mutation that prevents integration, their combination might lead to recombinants that either don't take up the DNA or do, depending on the specific interactions. \n\nSo in the first half, which is plated on strain B's lawn, the phages from the first half are more likely to cause lysis, so fewer would take up the DNA. Those that don't lyse would be the ones that carry the lysogenic phage's mutation. On the second half, which is plated on strain K's lawn, any phages that carry a recombined mutation would take up the DNA, while others wouldn't. \n\nGiven that in the first half, after dilution, the number of plumes (infections) is much lower compared to the second half, it implies that the presence of recombination affects the likelihood of infection. Specifically, the recombination frequency determines how often a phage successfully integrates the new mutation. \n\nThe problem states that only E. coli strain B was affected, suggesting that most of the phages caused lysis. Now, when both mutant types are present, the effect on strain B is such that only 40% of the phages took up the DNA (since 40/100 = 0.4), whereas on strain K, only 1% took up the DNA (since 4/100 = 0.04). Wait, no, wait: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K? Wait, no, the user wrote: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So on strain B's half, you get 4 plumes (40%), and on strain K's half, you get 40 plumes (40%). \n\nBut wait, the original statement says: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So yes, 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems contradictory. Because if strain B is mostly affected, it should have more infections. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood. Wait, the initial description says: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So on strain B's half, 40 plumes, and on strain K's half, 4 plumes. But the question says four plaques on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems inverted. Maybe I got it wrong. Let me read again: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo, on strain B's half, 40 plumes; on strain K's half, 4 plumes. So strain B is mostly affected, as expected. Now, what matters is how the presence of recombination affects the probabilities. If there is complete recombination, all phages would take up the DNA, but that's probably not the case here. Instead, the observed frequencies indicate that the recombination rate is such that on strain B's half, the probability is 40%, and on strain K's half, it's 1%. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expectation value is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Let's denote the probability of the lysogenic phage taking up the DNA as p, and the wild-type phage as q. But due to recombination, the actual probability that a phage carries both mutations is r. \n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present, it can only cause lysis, so the probability of infection is zero. When only the wild-type is present, the probability of infection is also zero, assuming no recombination. But when both are present, the probability becomes non-zero. \n\nIn the first half, which is plated on strain B's lawn, the phages from the first half are less likely to take up the DNA, so the number of plumes is low. Conversely, in the second half, which is plated on strain K's lawn, the phages from the second half are more likely to take up the DNA because strain K's phages are different. \n\nGiven that on strain B's half, 40% of the phages took up the DNA (plumes), and on strain K's half, only 1% did, we can model this. Let\u2019s assume that the presence of recombination reduces the effective probability of infection. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is R, then the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is R * p * q. Without recombination, p = q = 1, so the probability would be 1*1 = 1, which isn't possible. Actually, recombination would reduce this probability. \n\nLet\u2019s set up equations. Let\u2019s say that without recombination, the probability of a phage taking up the DNA is p for both types. With recombination, the probability becomes R*p*q, where R is the recombination frequency. But since p and q are independent, and under recombination, the combined probability is R*p*q. \n\nHowever, if the two mutations are linked, then the occurrence of one mutation affects the probability of the other. So the actual probability might be R*p*(1 - p), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of recombination increases the chance that a phage can integrate both mutations, thus reducing the chance of lysis. Therefore, the probability of infection decreases because the phage is more likely to integrate the new mutation, making it easier to cause lysis. \n\nSo, in the first half, where only the lysogenic phage is present, the probability of infection is zero. In the second half, where both types are present, the probability is non-zero. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP_infect = P_Y lysogenic + P_X wild-type + P_both\n\nWhere P_both is the probability that both mutations are present in the phage. \n\nAssuming that P_Y lysogenic doesn\u2019t take up the DNA, P_X wild-type doesn\u2019t take up the DNA, and P_both does. \n\nWithout recombination, P_both would be zero, so P_infect = 0. But with recombination, P_both increases. \n\nIn the first half, the only source of infection is P_both. So:\n\nP_infect_half1 = P_both * (probability of integrating both mutations)\n\nSimilarly, in the second half:\n\nP_infect_half2 = P_both * (probability of integrating both mutations)\n\nBut the presence of recombination affects the overall probability. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of interference. If recombination occurs, the events are not independent. \n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\np = probability that the lysogenic phage takes up the DNA.\n\nq = probability that the wild-type phage takes up the DNA.\n\nWith recombination, the probability that both take up the DNA is r = p * q * e^{-(distance)}, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if the two mutations are close enough, the probability that both occur is approximately p * q * (1 - d/(10^n)), where d is the distance in base pairs. But without knowing the exact distance, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the expected number of plasmids in each half is equal to the product of the dilution factor and the probability of integration. \n\nFor the first half (plated on strain B):\n\nE1 = (1e7) * p * q * r\n\nBut since p and q are both 1 (assuming no recombination initially), E1 = 1e7 * r. \n\nOn strain K's half:\n\nE2 = (1e5) * p * q * r\n\nAgain, E2 = 1e5 * r.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nOn strain B's half, 4 plumes occurred, which correspond to E1 = 4. So:\n\n1e7 * r = 4 => r = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7.\n\nOn strain K's half, 40 plumes occurred, so:\n\n1e5 * r = 40 => r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. Perhaps because the presence of recombination affects both halves differently. Alternatively, maybe the recombination occurs independently in each half.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to treat the two halves separately. Each half has its own probability of recombination. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nr1 = recombination frequency in the first half (plated on B).\n\nr2 = recombination frequency in the second half (plated on K).\n\nWe need to find the average recombination frequency across both halves, but the problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, which I think refers to the overall recombination rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is measured as the percentage of cross-phage recombinases that have integrated both mutations. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe another approach: the observed plasmid density after dilution relates to the actual recombination rate. Let\u2019s assume that the expected number of plasmids in each half is proportional to the dilution factor times the recombination rate.\n\nFor the first half:\n\nAfter dilution 1:1e7, the expected number of plasmids is N1 = (1e7) * r.\n\nN1 = 4 (plumes found), so:\n\n1e7 * r = 4 => r = 4e-7.\n\nFor the second half:\n\nAfter dilution 1:1e5, the expected number of plasmids is N2 = (1e5) * r.\n\nN2 = 40 (plumes found), so:\n\n1e5 * r = 40 => r = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nWait, this gives two different values for r, which is impossible unless the recombination rates differ between the halves. But that contradicts the idea that recombination is a global phenomenon. Therefore, perhaps the assumption that the expected number of plasmids equals the observed count is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the observed counts include background noise, but the key is that the ratio of plasmids between the two halves reflects the difference in dilution factors. \n\nGiven that on strain B's half, the plasmid density is 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7, and on strain K's half, it's 40 / 1e5 = 0.4. The ratio is 4e-7 : 0.4, which simplifies to 1 : 1e8. That suggests that the plasmid density is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, which is consistent with the square-root rule in horizontal gene transfer, where the transfer efficiency is proportional to sqrt(dilution factor). \n\nBut back to the recombination rate. If the same recombination rate applies to both halves, then both ratios should give the same r. But they don't. Therefore, perhaps the recombination rate varies between the two halves, indicating incomplete recombination. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is calculated as the harmonic mean or geometric mean of the two rates, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed plasmid densities are influenced by both the recombination rate and the presence of multiple phages. Let's think about the overall process. \n\nEach time a phage integrates, it can carry both mutations. The probability that a phage carries both mutations is r. The expected number of plasmids in each half is then:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r * (1 - s),\n\nwhere s is the selection coefficient against carrying both mutations. But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plasmids would depend on the probability of integration, which includes the chance of crossing over. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed plasmid densities. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nf = recombination frequency (as a fraction).\n\nThen, the expected number of plasmids in each half is:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * f,\n\nE2 = (1e5) * f.\n\nBut according to the experiments:\n\nE1 = 4,\n\nE2 = 40.\n\nSo,\n\n1e7 * f = 4 => f = 4 / 1e7 = 4e-7 \u2248 4e-7.\n\nAnd,\n\n1e5 * f = 40 => f = 40 / 1e5 = 0.4.\n\nThese two values are inconsistent, which suggests that the recombination frequency is not uniform across both halves. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nSince E1/E2 = (1e7)/(1e5) = 100. Also, E1/E2 = (4)/40 = 0.1.\n\nTherefore, 100 = 0.1, which is clearly not true. Hence, the recombination frequency must vary between the two halves. \n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the entire T_4 genome. It doesn't specify whether it's the average or the maximum. Given that, perhaps the overall recombination rate is determined by the sum or product of the individual recombination rates, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two halves are divided equally in terms of dilution, but the plasmid densities are different, perhaps the overall recombination rate is related to the harmonic mean or geometric mean of the two rates. \n\nThe harmonic mean of 4e-7 and 0.4 is 2 / (1/(4e-7) + 1/0.4)^(-1) = ... Let's compute it:\n\nCompute 1/(4e-7) \u2248 2.5e6,\n\n1/0.4 = 2.5,\n\nSum \u2248 2.5e6 + 2.5 \u2248 2.5e6,\n\nReciprocal \u2248 4e-6,\n\nWhich is 0.0004%, but that seems too small.\n\nAlternatively, the geometric mean is sqrt(4e-7 * 0.4) = sqrt(1.6e-7) \u2248 4e-4, which is 0.04%, still very small.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match the options provided. The options are in the range of 0.01% to 0.5%.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the observed plasmid density on each half is proportional to the product of the dilution factor and the recombination rate. So:\n\nOn B: (1e7) * r = 4 \u2192 r = 4e-7.\n\nOn K: (1e5) * r = 40 \u2192 r = 0.4.\n\nBut again, these are inconsistent. So perhaps the recombination rate is the same for both halves, but the observed counts are lower or higher due to selection.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of plasmids affects the growth, so some plasmids are selected against. Let's model this. Suppose that the selection coefficient against carrying both mutations is s. Then, the expected number of plasmids in each half would be:\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r * (1 - s),\n\nE2 = (1e5) * r * (1 - s).\n\nGiven that E1 = 4 and E2 = 40,\n\nDividing E1/E2 = (1e7 * r * (1 - s)) / (1e5 * r * (1 - s)) ) = 100 = 40 / 4 \u21d2 100 = 10, which is not correct. Thus, this suggests that the selection coefficient is such that the plasmid density is lower than expected. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is determined by the ratio of plasmid densities. Let\u2019s consider that the plasmid density in each half is inversely proportional to the dilution factor multiplied by the recombination rate. \n\nThus,\n\nE1 = (1e7) * r = 4,\n\nE2 = (1e5) * r = 40,\n\nBut solving these gives different r values. To reconcile this, perhaps the plasmid density is proportional to the product of dilution factor and recombination rate, but adjusted by a factor accounting for selection. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nE1 = k * (1e7) * r,\n\nE2 = k * (1e5) * r,\n\nWhere k is a constant that adjusts for selection. From E1 = 4 and E2 = 40,\n\nk * (1e7) * r = 4,\n\nk * (1e5) * r = 40.\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n(k * 1e5 * r) / (k * 1e7 * r) ) =",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",

    "rollout": " So if 40 occurred on B and 4 on K, maybe that relates to the number of recombinant phages?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about how exactly the numbers translate to recombination. Maybe I should think about the probabilities involved. If the two phages interacted, they would produce recombinant phages. Each wild-type phage has a certain probability of combining with the mutant. In this case, the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues, so perhaps the recombination rate affects whether a phage successfully infects.\n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both phages are present, only half of the bacteria die, meaning that most infections are successful. But why? Because some of the phages might have caused recombination, leading to successful infections without causing lysogeny issues. So the number of plumes on B being higher than on K might indicate that the recombination happened more often in the B strain.\n\nBut wait, the dilutions are different: 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. Dilution affects the likelihood of infection. A lower dilution means a higher chance of getting infected because fewer cells are plated. So if the B half was diluted less, it's more likely to pick up more infections. Since more infections led to more plumes on B, maybe the presence of more wild-type phages from the lysogenic type allowed them to combine with the recombined phages.\n\nAlternatively, considering the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of times a mutation combines with another. The observed plumes could relate to the number of recombinations. For example, if 40 were on B and 4 on K, maybe the number of recombinations is proportional to the difference in dilution rates. Wait, but I'm not sure how the exact numbers map to the recombination frequency directly.\n\nAnother approach: the expected number of plumes depends on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating. If the recombination happens, then the resulting phage is wild-type. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage is still resistant. So the number of plumes on the K culture would be influenced by the probability of the lysogenic phage successfully multiplying through the population, while on B, it's also influenced by the same process but with the possibility of some successful combinations due to recombination.\n\nWait, but the problem states that only the lysogenic phage does damage, so perhaps the recombination leads to the lysogenic phage becoming wild-type, allowing it to infect more cells. So if the K culture had 4 plumes and B had 40, maybe the K culture received more wild-type phages from recombination, thus having fewer plumes. Conversely, the B culture didn't see as many wild-type phages because the lysogenic ones didn't cause issues, so they had more lysogenic phages, leading to more plumes.\n\nSo the ratio of plumes on K to B would give us the ratio of wild-type phages between the two cultures. If 4 K vs 40 B, that's 1:10 ratio. Since the dilutions were 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively, the ratio of wild-type phages would correspond to the recombination frequency. \n\nLet me model this. Let\u2019s say the proportion of wild-type phages from the lysogenic type that recombine with the normal phages is R. Then, the total number of wild-type phages in the B culture would be (1 - R) * original + R * new. Similarly for K. But given that K showed fewer plumes, it's possible that the recombination rate R increased the number of wild-type phages in the K culture, making them more susceptible, hence fewer plumes.\n\nWait, no, that contradicts. Alternatively, if recombination leads to more wild-type phages, then in the K culture, where dilution is lower, the number of wild-type phages increases, leading to more plumes because they're more likely to infect. So if K had 4 plumes and B had 40, that implies K has more wild-type phages, so the recombination must have occurred at a higher rate in K compared to B. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of phages that successfully infect. So if K has fewer plumes, that means fewer wild-type phages were able to infect their cells. That would happen if the lysogenic phage in K is more resistant, i.e., the recombination rate is higher in K. So the recombination frequency is higher in K, meaning more of the lysogenic phage combined with wild-type, making them wild-type and more likely to infect.\n\nIn terms of calculation, the expected number of plumes would depend on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating. Assuming that all phages have the same survival probability except for those that have undergone recombination, we can calculate the expected number of plumes.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the fraction of phages that have recombined is r. Therefore, the number of wild-type phages in K would be (1 - r) * (1 - r) + r * (1 - r), assuming that only the lysogenic phage can recombine with others. Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler: the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r) * L + r * W, where L is the original lysogenic phage and W is the wild-type. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If the K culture had 4 plumes and B had 40, and the dilutions were 1:10^5 and 1:10^7 respectively, the ratio of plumes is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the number of wild-type phages in K is 1/10th that in B. How does recombination affect this? Perhaps the number of wild-type phages in K is higher, so the ratio decreases. If the recombination frequency in K is higher, then the number of wild-type phages would be higher relative to B.\n\nWait, but in reality, if the recombination rate is higher, the number of wild-type phages would increase, leading to more plumes. So if K had fewer plumes, that would suggest a lower recombination rate, which seems contradictory. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the proportion of wild-type phages that survived the plating. If the plumes decrease with higher recombination, that makes sense. So if K had fewer plumes, it means more wild-type phages survived, implying higher recombination in K. But K was plated at a lower dilution, which usually means more cells, so more chance to survive. However, the fact that K had fewer plumes despite lower dilution suggests that the recombination must have been occurring more frequently in K compared to B.\n\nGiven the options provided, I'm trying to find the recombination frequency that best fits the observed data. The observed ratio of plumes is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. The dilutions were 1:10^5 and 1:10^7. Let's denote r as the recombination frequency. If r is high in K, it would mean that more of the lysogenic phage has recombined with wild-type, increasing the number of wild-type phages, which would lead to more plumes. But in this case, K had fewer plumes, suggesting that the recombination wasn't as frequent in K as in B. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely related to the number of plumes. Wait, perhaps the formula is plume_count = (L * (1 - r) + W * r)^something. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it's simpler to use the concept that the number of wild-type phages determines the number of plumes. So if K had fewer plumes, it means fewer wild-type phages, implying lower recombination. But the answer choices don't include \"lower than 0.05 percent.\" So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful infections, which depends on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating and correctly multiplying. So if the recombination is more frequent, the resulting phage is wild-type, which is more likely to multiply and infect, thus producing more plumes. Conversely, if the recombination rate is lower, the lysogenic phage remains wild-type, so fewer plumes occur.\n\nWait, so if the recombination frequency is higher, more plumes would occur. If K had fewer plumes, that would imply lower recombination, which contradicts. Unless the plumes count is inversely related to recombination frequency. Maybe the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nIf K had 4 plumes and B had 40, that's a ratio of 1:10. If I assume that the recombination frequency is proportional to the inverse of the plume count, then the ratio would be 10:1. So the recombination frequency in K is 10 times higher than in B. Looking back at the options, none of them mention 10x, but option D is 0.05%, which is very low. Option C is 1.5%, which is closer. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is determined by the square root of the dilution factor. So sqrt(10^7) is 10^(7/2)= approx 316, and sqrt(10^5)= approx 316 too. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of wild-type phages. If K had fewer plumes, it means fewer wild-type phages. The recombination frequency would determine how much the lysogenic phage has combined with wild-type. If the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r)*original + r*new. But since the new phage isn't mentioned, perhaps it's assumed that only the lysogenic phage is available.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the number of plumes is equal to the number of wild-type phages multiplied by the number of viable cells. Given that K had fewer plumes, it implies fewer wild-type phages, meaning lower recombination. But again, the options don't provide such a low value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency. So if K has fewer plumes, recombination is higher in K. But none of the options go beyond 0.02%.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Phages) / (Total Number of Phages)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Another thought: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving and multiplying. So if the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r). The number of plumes would then be proportional to (1 - r).\n\nGiven that K had fewer plumes, (1 - r_K) </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if 40 occurred on B and 4 on K, maybe that relates to the number of recombinant phages?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about how exactly the numbers translate to recombination. Maybe I should think about the probabilities involved. If the two phages interacted, they would produce recombinant phages. Each wild-type phage has a certain probability of combining with the mutant.

Dilution affects the likelihood of infection. A lower dilution means a higher chance of getting infected because fewer cells are plated. So if the B half was diluted less, it's more likely to pick up more infections. Since more infections led to more plumes on B, maybe the presence of more wild-type phages from the lysogenic type allowed them to combine with the recombined phages.\n\nAlternatively, considering the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of times a mutation combines with another. The observed plumes could relate to the number of recombinations. For example, if 40 were on B and 4 on K, maybe the number of recombinations is proportional to the difference in dilution rates. Wait, but I'm not sure how the exact numbers map to the recombination frequency directly.\n\nAnother approach: the expected number of plumes depends on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating. If the recombination happens, then the resulting phage is wild-type. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage is still resistant. So the number of plumes on the K culture would be influenced by the probability of the lysogenic phage successfully multiplying through the population, while on B, it's also influenced by the same process but with the possibility of some successful combinations due to recombination.\n\nWait, but the problem states that only the lysogenic phage does damage, so perhaps the recombination leads to the lysogenic phage becoming wild-type, allowing it to infect more cells. So if the K culture had 4 plumes and B had 40, maybe the K culture received more wild-type phages from recombination, thus having fewer plumes. Conversely, the B culture didn't see as many wild-type phages because the lysogenic ones didn't cause issues, so they had more lysogenic phages, leading to more plumes.\n\nSo the ratio of plumes on K to B would give us the ratio of wild-type phages between the two cultures. If 4 K vs 40 B, that's 1:10 ratio. Since the dilutions were 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively, the ratio of wild-type phages would correspond to the recombination frequency. \n\nLet me model this. Let\u2019s say the proportion of wild-type phages from the lysogenic type that recombine with the normal phages is R. Then, the total number of wild-type phages in the B culture would be (1 - R) * original + R * new. Similarly for K. But given that K showed fewer plumes, it's possible that the recombination rate R increased the number of wild-type phages in the K culture, making them more susceptible, hence fewer plumes.\n\nWait, no, that contradicts. Alternatively, if recombination leads to more wild-type phages, then in the K culture, where dilution is lower, the number of wild-type phages increases, leading to more plumes because they're more likely to infect. So if K had 4 plumes and B had 40, that implies K has more wild-type phages, so the recombination must have occurred at a higher rate in K compared to B. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of phages that successfully infect. So if K has fewer plumes, that means fewer wild-type phages were able to infect their cells. That would happen if the lysogenic phage in K is more resistant, i.e., the recombination rate is higher in K. So the recombination frequency is higher in K, meaning more of the lysogenic phage combined with wild-type, making them wild-type and more likely to infect.\n\nIn terms of calculation, the expected number of plumes would depend on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating. Assuming that all phages have the same survival probability except for those that have undergone recombination, we can calculate the expected number of plumes.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, then the fraction of phages that have recombined is r. Therefore, the number of wild-type phages in K would be (1 - r) * (1 - r) + r * (1 - r), assuming that only the lysogenic phage can recombine with others. Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler: the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r) * L + r * W, where L is the original lysogenic phage and W is the wild-type. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. If the K culture had 4 plumes and B had 40, and the dilutions were 1:10^5 and 1:10^7 respectively, the ratio of plumes is 4:40 = 1:10. This suggests that the number of wild-type phages in K is 1/10th that in B. How does recombination affect this? Perhaps the number of wild-type phages in K is higher, so the ratio decreases. If the recombination frequency in K is higher, then the number of wild-type phages would be higher relative to B.\n\nWait, but in reality, if the recombination rate is higher, the number of wild-type phages would increase, leading to more plumes. So if K had fewer plumes, that would suggest a lower recombination rate, which seems contradictory. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the proportion of wild-type phages that survived the plating. If the plumes decrease with higher recombination, that makes sense. So if K had fewer plumes, it means more wild-type phages survived, implying higher recombination in K. But K was plated at a lower dilution, which usually means more cells, so more chance to survive. However, the fact that K had fewer plumes despite lower dilution suggests that the recombination must have been occurring more frequently in K compared to B.\n\nGiven the options provided, I'm trying to find the recombination frequency that best fits the observed data. The observed ratio of plumes is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. The dilutions were 1:10^5 and 1:10^7. Let's denote r as the recombination frequency. If r is high in K, it would mean that more of the lysogenic phage has recombined with wild-type, increasing the number of wild-type phages, which would lead to more plumes. But in this case, K had fewer plumes, suggesting that the recombination wasn't as frequent in K as in B. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is inversely related to the number of plumes. Wait, perhaps the formula is plume_count = (L * (1 - r) + W * r)^something. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it's simpler to use the concept that the number of wild-type phages determines the number of plumes. So if K had fewer plumes, it means fewer wild-type phages, implying lower recombination. But the answer choices don't include \"lower than 0.05 percent.\" So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful infections, which depends on the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving the plating and correctly multiplying. So if the recombination is more frequent, the resulting phage is wild-type, which is more likely to multiply and infect, thus producing more plumes. Conversely, if the recombination rate is lower, the lysogenic phage remains wild-type, so fewer plumes occur.\n\nWait, so if the recombination frequency is higher, more plumes would occur. If K had fewer plumes, that would imply lower recombination, which contradicts. Unless the plumes count is inversely related to recombination frequency. Maybe the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nIf K had 4 plumes and B had 40, that's a ratio of 1:10. If I assume that the recombination frequency is proportional to the inverse of the plume count, then the ratio would be 10:1. So the recombination frequency in K is 10 times higher than in B. Looking back at the options, none of them mention 10x, but option D is 0.05%, which is very low. Option C is 1.5%, which is closer. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is determined by the square root of the dilution factor. So sqrt(10^7) is 10^(7/2)= approx 316, and sqrt(10^5)= approx 316 too. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of wild-type phages. If K had fewer plumes, it means fewer wild-type phages. The recombination frequency would determine how much the lysogenic phage has combined with wild-type. If the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r)*original + r*new. But since the new phage isn't mentioned, perhaps it's assumed that only the lysogenic phage is available.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the number of plumes is equal to the number of wild-type phages multiplied by the number of viable cells. Given that K had fewer plumes, it implies fewer wild-type phages, meaning lower recombination. But again, the options don't provide such a low value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency. So if K has fewer plumes, recombination is higher in K. But none of the options go beyond 0.02%.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Phages) / (Total Number of Phages)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Another thought: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each phage surviving and multiplying. So if the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r). The number of plumes would then be proportional to (1 - r).\n\nGiven that K had fewer plumes, (1 - r_K) </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.

Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, possibly causing a more severe phenotype. If the two mutations are in the same gene, then recombination wouldn't make a difference\u2014unless they're in different genes, which isn't the case here. In this scenario, the two mutations are in different regions, so recombination could lead to a double mutant. However, the result shows that most of the phages cause lytic fission on B, indicating that the lysogenic mutation was dominant. That might suggest that without recombination, the lysogenic phage alone could cause issues, so any recombination would prevent that.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that both types of mutants are present, but only the lysogenic one affects strain B. So when both are present, maybe the lysogenic phage can still cause problems because the recombination makes the double mutant less effective? Or perhaps the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to function better in a host where another mutation is present. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the numbers given. Each half is split into two groups: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and one with lower dilution (1:10^5). Then these are plated on different strains' lichens. The number of plumes (infections) on strain K is 4, and on strain B is 40. Since the plate for B has a higher dilution, it should have fewer plumes because the phages are more concentrated. Similarly, the plate for K has a lower dilution, so it should have more plumes. The observed data matches this expectation, meaning the presence of recombination is likely because it increases the likelihood of interactions between the two mutations.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for calculating the probability of recombination between two loci is:\n\nRecomb freq = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nIn this context, the total number of infections is the sum of the plumes on both plates, which is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant plumes would be those that show a certain phenotype due to the combination of the two mutations. Since only the lysogenic phage causes issues on strain B, but when both are present, the lysogenic phage is partially effective, implying that the recombination prevents the full lethality. Therefore, the number of recombinants would correspond to the plumes that are not entirely ineffective, which seems a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of the phages, we can infer that the recombination frequency is high enough to reduce the total number of effective phages. Given that the majority of the plumes (40 out of 44) are on strain B, this suggests that recombination is occurring frequently because it reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage on strain B. \n\nTo estimate recombination frequency (RF), the formula is often RF \u2248 (1 - sqrt(p)), where p is the probability of recombination. Alternatively, if we assume that the expected number of recombinant events is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, but I'm not sure about the exact approach here.\n\nAnother way is to use the concept that the number of recombinant plumes would be equal to the product of the fractions of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote f1 as the fraction of lysogenic phages and f2 as the fraction of the other type. If the two mutations are independent, the probability that both occur (recombination) is f1 * f2. But since we don\u2019t know the exact frequencies, we can relate the observed plume counts to the expected values under complete independence versus complete linkage.\n\nUnder complete independence (no recombination), all plumes would follow the product of their probabilities. Under complete linkage (no recombination), the phenotypes would be additive, so the number of recombinant plumes would be zero. However, in our case, some plumes are recombinant (on strain K), so recombination must be occurring.\n\nGiven that the majority of the plumes are on strain B, which is primarily affected by the lysogenic mutation, it suggests that the recombination is reducing the effectiveness of the phages on strain B. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high enough to explain why 40 out of 44 plumes are on strain B, indicating that only a small fraction of the phages are effectively lysogenic on strain B.\n\nBut to find the exact percentage, perhaps we can model it. Let\u2019s say the recombination frequency is R. The probability that a phage is effectively lysogenic on strain B is (1 - R), and on strain K, it's (1 - R) as well, assuming similar effects. However, this might not account for the observed data accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals)\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinants is proportional to the square root of the product of the frequencies, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe it's simpler to think in terms of the number of plumes. Since 40 out of 44 are on strain B, and 4 are on K, perhaps the recombination is responsible for the extra 3 plumes on K compared to what would be expected under complete independence.\n\nIf there were no recombination, the expected number of plumes on strain K would be the total plumes multiplied by the probability that a phage is non-recombinant. Let\u2019s denote N as the total number of plumes (44). Suppose the recombination frequency is R, so the probability that a phage is non-recombinant is (1 - R). Then the expected number of plumes on K would be N*(1 - R) = 44*(1 - R). However, the observed number is 4, so:\n\n44*(1 - R) = 4  \n(1 - R) = 4/44  \nR = 1 - (4/44)  \nR = 1 - 1/11 \u2248 0.909, which is over 90%, but this contradicts the observation that only 4 out of 44 are on K, suggesting low recombination. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of recombinants is 40 on B and 4 on K. Assuming that recombination occurs at a rate R, the number of recombinant plumes would depend on R. However, without knowing the individual mutation frequencies, it's challenging to compute directly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination reduces the overall effectiveness of the phages. Since only 4 out of 44 are on strain B, which is mostly affected by the lysogenic mutation, recombination must be occurring at a high frequency. Let\u2019s assume that the number of recombinant plumes is proportional to the square root of the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. But again, without specific mutation frequencies, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the answer choices are percentages like 0.05% etc., and considering that the majority of the plumes are on strain B, it suggests a relatively low recombination frequency. For instance, if the recombination frequency is around 0.05%, then the number of recombinant plumes would be very few, aligning with the observed data. Alternatively, 0.02% or 0.05% could fit.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.05%, E is 0.02%. Considering that the majority of the plumes are on B, a lower recombination frequency like 0.05% would explain the observed distribution, whereas 0.02% would also fit. However, the correct calculation would require more precise modeling.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for expected recombinant plumes:\n\nExpected recombinant plumes = (total plumes) * sqrt(f1 * f2)\n\nBut without knowing f1 and f2, it's unclear. Alternatively, the number of recombinant plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Since the plumes are 40 on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that recombination occurred in such a way that it reduced the effectiveness of the phages significantly, leading to fewer recombinant plumes on K.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would be such that 4 out of 44 are on K, implying that 40 out of 44 are on B, which is 10:1. This could indicate a high level of recombination. However, none of the answer choices go beyond 5%, so perhaps the correct choice is F, 0.5%, but I'm unsure.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the double mutant being less common than expected if recombination happened. If recombination had occurred, the double mutant would be rare. Here, since only 4 plumes are on K, which is much fewer than expected if recombination occurred, it suggests significant recombination. The closest option above 0.05% is H, 5%, but that's too high.

Since the phages are being tested across a large population of cells, we can assume random mating for the mutation at that locus. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant plasmids is N = n * p * q, where n is the total number of plasmids, and p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.

If the mutations were not recombined, the integration might be less likely. So, if the phage integrated into both strains, you'd expect fewer plasmids on both. Instead, if integration happens at one site rather than both, you'd see more plasmids on the strain where the mutation didn't happen.\n\nLooking at the numbers, in the first dilution (1:10^7), only 4 plasmids on B indicate successful infection. In the second dilution (1:10^5), 40 plasmids on K suggest a high level of successful infection. This suggests that the integration happened more frequently in the second dilution, meaning that the mutations may have been recombined or that the phage is more likely to integrate into one strain than the other.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, I think we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = 1 - (Proportion of plasmids without recombination)\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is using the observed plasmid load. The expected number of plasmids from recombination would be influenced by the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, since we're dealing with a single locus, the probability of recombination is the fraction of the total plasmids that come from recombining events.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on strain B in the first dilution is 4 and on strain K is 40, perhaps we can infer that the recombination rate is such that the phages are more likely to integrate into one strain than the other. \n\nGiven that the plasmids on strain B are low (4) and on strain K are high (40), this suggests that the phage integrated into strain K more often than into strain B, implying that the mutation at T_4RII caused preferential integration into strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be significant.\n\nBut let's think in terms of probabilities. Suppose the probability of each mutation occurring is p and q respectively. The probability of recombination would be p*q. However, since the phages are being tested across a population, the actual number of recombined plasmids would depend on how often the mutations occurred independently.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x%, then approximately x% of the total phages would have recombined. So, given that in the first dilution, only 4 phages were successful, and in the second, 40 were successful, the ratio of success rates suggests that the recombination frequency is high enough to cause much more plasmid load on strain K.\n\nCalculating the exact value, let's denote the total number of phages as N. In the first dilution, N/10^7 phages were plated on strain B, resulting in 4 successful infections. In the second dilution, N/10^5 phages were plated on strain K, resulting in 40 successful infections. Assuming that the recombination frequency is r, the number of recombined phages would be r*N/10^7, and the remaining would be non-recombined. \n\nSo, the number of successful infections on strain B would be (1 - r)*N/10^7 = 4, and on strain K, it would be r*N/10^7 + (1 - r)*N/10^5 = 40.\n\nFrom the first equation: (1 - r)*(N / 10^7) = 4 \u2192 N = (4*10^7)/(1 - r).\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nr*(4*10^7/(1 - r))/10^7 + (1 - r)*(4*10^7/(1 - r))/10^5 = 40.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4r/(1 - r) + (1 - r)*(4*10^2)/1 = 40.\n\nThis gives us:\n\n(4r)/(1 - r) + 400*(1 - r) = 40.\n\nHmm, solving this seems a bit complex, but maybe assuming that r is small enough that 1 - r \u2248 1, making the equation approximate:\n\n4r + 400 = 40 \u2192 4r = -360 \u2192 r = -90%. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, since the second dilution has a higher concentration, the effect of recombination becomes more pronounced. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the recombination frequency leads to more plasmids on the strain where the mutation did not occur. Given that strain K had 40 plasmids, while strain B had only 4, the recombination must have occurred significantly.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs in x% of cases, the expected number of plasmids on strain K would be (1 - x/100)*N/10^7 + (x/100)*N/10^5. Setting this equal to 40 and knowing that on strain B it's 4, perhaps we can solve for x.\n\nBut this might get too involved. Alternatively, thinking in terms of the ratio of plasmids on the two strains. Since strain K has 10 times more plasmids than strain B, it suggests that the recombination frequency is high enough that the majority of phages integrated into strain K. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is 50%, then on average, half of the phages would have integrated into one strain and half into the other. But in our case, strain K had 10 times more plasmids than strain B. This implies that the recombination must have occurred significantly more often in favor of integrating into strain K.\n\nLet\u2019s try setting up equations. Let\u2019s say the recombination frequency is r (as a decimal). Then:\n\nPlasmids on B = (1 - r) * (N / 10^7) = 4\n\nPlasmids on K = r * (N / 10^7) + (1 - r) * (N / 10^5) = 40\n\nFrom the first equation: (1 - r) * N = 4 * 10^7 \u2192 N = (4 * 10^7)/(1 - r)\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\nr * (4 * 10^7)/(1 - r) + (1 - r) * (4 * 10^7)/(10^5) = 40\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4 * 10^7 * r)/(1 - r) + (4 * 10^7 * (1 - r))/(10^5) = 40\n\nDivide all terms by 4 * 10^7:\n\nr/(1 - r) + (1 - r)/100 = 1/10\n\nMultiply through by 100*(1 - r):\n\n100r + (1 - r)^2 = 10*(1 - r)\n\nExpand (1 - r)^2:\n\n100r + 1 - 2r + r^2 = 10 - 10r\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nr^2 + 98r + 1 = 10 - 10r\n\nBring everything to left side:\n\nr^2 + 108r + 1 - 10 = 0 \u2192 r^2 + 108r - 9 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nr = [-108 \u00b1 sqrt(108^2 + 4*9)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n108^2 = 11664; 4*9=36 \u2192 sqrt(11664 + 36)=sqrt(11700)=approx 108.167\n\nThus:\n\nr=(-108 \u00b1 108.167)/2\n\nWe take positive root:\n\n(-108 + 108.167)/2\u22480.167/2\u22480.0835\u2192 approx 8.35%\n\nSo the recombination frequency is approximately 8.35%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). Hmm, 8.35% isn't exactly any of the options, but perhaps rounding or miscalculation. Maybe I made a mistake in assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the increase in plasmid loading on strain K compared to B indicates that recombination is high. Using the formula for the expected number of recombinants, which is N * p * q, but in this case, since both mutations are at the same locus, the probability of recombination is higher. \n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the increase in plasmid count on strain K suggests that recombination occurred more frequently than not. If no recombination happened, you'd expect similar plasmid loads on both strains. Here, K has much higher plasmids, indicating recombination.\n\nBut without precise calculation tools, it's hard to find the exact percentage. However, looking back at the possible answers, 1% (A), 2% (B), etc., none match 8.35%. Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is around 1.5% as it's closer to 0.05%.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect. Another thought: the increase in plasmid load on strain K could be due to the fact that the recombination increased the number of phages that integrated into K. If the recombination frequency is x, then the probability that a phage integrates into K is p = (1 + r)/2, and into B is q = (1 - r)/2, assuming equal chances. But since the phages are being plated on different strains, the integration depends on the host. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmid counts on the two strains. Since strain K had 40 plasmids and strain B had 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that recombination occurred 9 times more often in favor of K. \n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, if the recombination happened 9 times more often in K, the frequency might be around 1% or 2%. Given that, option B (2%) or F (0.3%) are close. But earlier calculations suggested ~8.35%, which doesn't match. Maybe I should reconsider the model.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach: if the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of recombinant phages would be R*N. The difference between the two strains reflects this. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on K is 10 times higher than on B, and given that recombination occurs more frequently on K, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1.5% (option C), as it's the closest among the choices. \n\nBut honestly, without precise calculation, it's tricky. However, based on typical values, recombination frequencies in phages are usually in the range of 1-5%, so the most reasonable answer among the options provided is probably C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). Given that the increase is multiplicative, perhaps 1.5% makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages successfully integrated into the bacterial genome, right? Similarly, 40 on B would mean 40 successful infections on strain B's lawn.\n\nNow, I remember that when two mutations occur at the same site in a phage, the probability of recombination (or co-infection) depends on how often they cross over during the replication process. Since the phages are being tested across a large population of cells, we can assume random mating for the mutation at that locus. \n\nThe formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant plasmids is N = n * p * q, where n is the total number of plasmids, and p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. However, in this case, since both mutations are happening at the same site, the combined probability should be higher than either individual. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about it as the probability of recombination is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If both mutations are independent, then the chance that they occurred together is (p * q). But since the phages are being plated on different strains, I'm a bit confused about how that affects things. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The key here is that when both mutations are present at the same site, the likelihood of their co-occurrence increases. The observed number of plasmids on each strain will depend on how many times each mutation was present. \n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the result was 4 plasmids on strain B. On the second dilution (1:10^5), it was 40 plasmids on strain K. This suggests that the presence of both mutations increased the chance of successful infection more in the second dilution. \n\nSince the bacteria are being plated on two different strains, the combination of mutations might influence whether the phage integrates into those strains. If the mutations were not recombined, the integration might be less likely. So, if the phage integrated into both strains, you'd expect fewer plasmids on both. Instead, if integration happens at one site rather than both, you'd see more plasmids on the strain where the mutation didn't happen.\n\nLooking at the numbers, in the first dilution (1:10^7), only 4 plasmids on B indicate successful infection.

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes mean 40 successful infections on B, and 4 on K. \n\nHmm, I think I remember something about the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. If the mutations are independent, we'd expect certain probabilities. But since it's a reciprocal test for recombination, maybe the number of double recombinants would indicate how much recombination has happened. \n\nThe formula for the expected number of recombinant offspring in a double crossover is generally calculated using the map distances. But wait, in this case, I'm dealing with double mutants because both mutations are present. So if we have two regions (say R1 and R2), and each mutation occurs independently, then the chance that two regions are recombined twice (double crossover) might be relevant here.\n\nLet me recall the concept. Recombination frequency is usually measured as the percentage of gametes where the chromosomes have swapped parts. In double crossovers, you get four recombinant types, and the probability depends on the individual recombination frequencies at each region. However, in this problem, we're looking for the degree of recombination between the two mutations causing different outcomes in the same host.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Since the cells are being plated on different bacterial strains (B and K), and the number of plumes indicates the likelihood of recombination affecting their responses. If recombination occurs, the phages might interact differently, leading to different outcomes when tested against different backgrounds.\n\nIn the initial scenario, when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. But when both types are present, the effect is partially reversed. This partial reversal suggests that the lysogenic phages have some interaction with the wild-type phages, possibly through recombination, so that when they're mixed, some of the lysogenic phages don't cause as severe effects, while others do. \n\nBut I'm supposed to calculate the recombination rate. Maybe I should use the formula for the probability of double crossover, which is (1 - F1)(1 - F2), assuming F1 and F2 are the map distances. However, without specific values for F1 and F2, I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers given: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a ratio of 10:1. Perhaps the recombination fraction is approximately 1/10, which is 0.1, or 1%. But wait, let me think again.\n\nIf the recombination leads to double recombinants, then the expected number would depend on the product of the two recombination fractions. For example, if each mutation has a 50% chance of recombining, the double recombination would be 25%, but in reality, it's less because the events are not entirely independent. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.\n\nAnother angle: in a double cross, the number of recombinant offspring is proportional to the square of the interference. But without knowing the exact interference, it's tricky. Alternatively, since the number of plumes is higher on B, perhaps the presence of both mutations allows more successful infections when combined, indicating a lower level of interference or more efficient crossing over.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine the proportion of double recombinants. Each double recombinant event would lead to more successful infections. If the observed number of plumes on K is significantly fewer than expected under complete independence, it suggests that the recombination is occurring more often than expected, meaning a lower recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1. That could imply that recombination occurred once every 10 cells, so a 1% recombination rate. Because 1% would mean that each cell has a 1% chance of recombining, so 99% remains unchanged. Therefore, the expected number of double recombinants would be around 1 per 100 cells, leading to 10 plumes on average, but we saw 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the plume counts. Plumes represent successful infections. So if the two bacteria are treated separately, one group (plated on B) had 40 plumes, and the other (plated on K) had 4. That suggests that the combination caused a decrease in the number of successful infections compared to the individual cases. That's consistent with some form of interference where recombination reduces the likelihood of both mutations happening together.\n\nBut how does that translate to recombination frequency? Maybe the number of double recombinants is related to the interference. If the interference is high, fewer double recombinants occur, leading to fewer total plumes. But without knowing the exact model, it's hard to pin down.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way is to consider that the difference in plumes reflects the recombination. Since the initial scenario shows that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but when both are present, the effect is split, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is sometimes interacting with wild-type ones. This interaction would likely involve recombination, changing the outcome.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is low enough that only a small portion of the phages would exchange genetic material, leading to some overlap in their effects. If the recombination happens once every 100 cells, then the expected number of double recombinants would be 1, so the plumes would be 10 on average. But we see 4 on B and 40 on K, which is ten times higher, so perhaps the recombination is more frequent.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency must be such that the number of double recombinants multiplied by the number of cells gives us the observed plumes. If the observed number is 10x higher on B and 10x higher on K, then the recombination frequency must be 1%, because 1% means each cell has a 1% chance of recombining, leading to 99% unchanged, so the expected number of double recombinants would be 1 per 100 cells, resulting in 10 plumes on average.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes mean 40 successful infections on B, and 4 on K. \n\nHmm, I think I remember something about the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. If the mutations are independent, we'd expect certain probabilities. But since it's a reciprocal test for recombination, maybe the number of double recombinants would indicate how much recombination has happened. \n\nThe formula for the expected number of recombinant offspring in a double crossover is generally calculated using the map distances. But wait, in this case, I'm dealing with double mutants because both mutations are present. So if we have two regions (say R1 and R2), and each mutation occurs independently, then the chance that two regions are recombined twice (double crossover) might be relevant here.\n\nLet me recall the concept. Recombination frequency is usually measured as the percentage of gametes where the chromosomes have swapped parts. In double crossovers, you get four recombinant types, and the probability depends on the individual recombination frequencies at each region. However, in this problem, we're looking for the degree of recombination between the two mutations causing different outcomes in the same host.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Since the cells are being plated on different bacterial strains (B and K), and the number of plumes indicates the likelihood of recombination affecting their responses. If recombination occurs, the phages might interact differently, leading to different outcomes when tested against different backgrounds.\n\nIn the initial scenario, when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. But when both types are present, the effect is partially reversed. This partial reversal suggests that the lysogenic phages have some interaction with the wild-type phages, possibly through recombination, so that when they're mixed, some of the lysogenic phages don't cause as severe effects, while others do. \n\nBut I'm supposed to calculate the recombination rate. Maybe I should use the formula for the probability of double crossover, which is (1 - F1)(1 - F2), assuming F1 and F2 are the map distances. However, without specific values for F1 and F2, I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers given: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like a ratio of 10:1. Perhaps the recombination fraction is approximately 1/10, which is 0.1, or 1%. But wait, let me think again.\n\nIf the recombination leads to double recombinants, then the expected number would depend on the product of the two recombination fractions. For example, if each mutation has a 50% chance of recombining, the double recombination would be 25%, but in reality, it's less because the events are not entirely independent. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.\n\nAnother angle: in a double cross, the number of recombinant offspring is proportional to the square of the interference. But without knowing the exact interference, it's tricky. Alternatively, since the number of plumes is higher on B, perhaps the presence of both mutations allows more successful infections when combined, indicating a lower level of interference or more efficient crossing over.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine the proportion of double recombinants. Each double recombinant event would lead to more successful infections. If the observed number of plumes on K is significantly fewer than expected under complete independence, it suggests that the recombination is occurring more often than expected, meaning a lower recombination frequency.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1. That could imply that recombination occurred once every 10 cells, so a 1% recombination rate. Because 1% would mean that each cell has a 1% chance of recombining, so 99% remains unchanged. Therefore, the expected number of double recombinants would be around 1 per 100 cells, leading to 10 plumes on average, but we saw 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the plume counts. Plumes represent successful infections. So if the two bacteria are treated separately, one group (plated on B) had 40 plumes, and the other (plated on K) had 4. That suggests that the combination caused a decrease in the number of successful infections compared to the individual cases. That's consistent with some form of interference where recombination reduces the likelihood of both mutations happening together.\n\nBut how does that translate to recombination frequency? Maybe the number of double recombinants is related to the interference. If the interference is high, fewer double recombinants occur, leading to fewer total plumes. But without knowing the exact model, it's hard to pin down.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way is to consider that the difference in plumes reflects the recombination. Since the initial scenario shows that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but when both are present, the effect is split, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is sometimes interacting with wild-type ones. This interaction would likely involve recombination, changing the outcome.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is low enough that only a small portion of the phages would exchange genetic material, leading to some overlap in their effects. If the recombination happens once every 100 cells, then the expected number of double recombinants would be 1, so the plumes would be 10 on average. But we see 4 on B and 40 on K, which is ten times higher, so perhaps the recombination is more frequent.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency must be such that the number of double recombinants multiplied by the number of cells gives us the observed plumes. If the observed number is 10x higher on B and 10x higher on K, then the recombination frequency must be 1%, because 1% means each cell has a 1% chance of recombining, leading to 99% unchanged, so the expected number of double recombinants would be 1 per 100 cells, resulting in 10 plumes on average. But our data shows 4 on B and 40 on K, which is exactly 10 times higher, so the recombination frequency must be 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 1 percent, which aligns with my reasoning.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Dilution usually refers to the concentration of the plasmid DNA before plating. If a sample is diluted 1:10^n, then the concentration is 1e-n times the original. So a higher n means lower concentration. In this case, one group is diluted 1:1e7 (since 10^7), and the other is 1:1e5. \n\nNow, the number of plasmids per cell depends on the mutation status. For example, if a phage has a mutation causing lysogenic replication, it might replicate more effectively without lysis, leading to more plasmids per cell compared to a non-lytic phage. Similarly, the lysogenic phage may cause more plasmids due to better replication without lysis.\n\nThe key here is the interaction between the two mutants. Since both cause issues when mixed, their combined effect leads to increased plasmid numbers on strain B and K. However, the specific numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. Wait, no, actually, upon mixing, the bacteria should be equally divided, right? So if both halves are treated separately, the total should reflect the combination of both mutations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The main idea is that the two mutants (mutant X and mutant Y) are present together. Their interactions determine whether they cause a problem or not. Since only the lysogenic phage does something bad, any presence of both types could lead to interference. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is dominant, meaning that even with the lysogenic phage, it's sufficient for the lysogeny to cause problems.\n\nBut let's focus on the experiment. Each half is plated on either strain B or K. On strain B, most of the colonies die because the lysogenic phage caused the issue. On strain K, fewer colonies died because the lysogenic phage didn't interact as well, or vice versa.\n\nWait, the setup says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So one half is used on strain B's lawn, and the other half is used on strain K's lawn. After incubation, on strain B's lawn, 40 colonies died, and on strain K's lawn, 4 colonies died. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused more deaths on strain B than on K. Because strain B is where the lysogenic phage was effective, whereas strain K would see less damage.\n\nHmm, wait, but the initial statement said that in the first scenario, only lysogenic phages cause death. So in the first case, all the cells have lysogenic phages, but now both types are present. So in the second experiment, when both are present, the outcome depends on the interaction.\n\nSo in the first half, when plated on strain B, 40 colonies died. That suggests that on strain B, the lysogenic phage caused more deaths. But normally, only lysogenic phages cause death. So perhaps in the presence of lysogenic phages, the lysogenic ones are more efficient at replicating without lysis. So maybe the lysogenic phage has a higher replication rate in the absence of lysis, leading to more plasmids per cell.\n\nIn the second half, when plated on strain K, only 4 colonies died. This implies that the lysogenic phage didn't contribute much in this case. Maybe because strain K's phages are non-lytic, so the lysogenic phage isn't as effective there. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage on strain K wasn't able to replicate without lysis as efficiently as on strain B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants causes some interference, such as competition for resources, reducing the overall number of plasmids per cell. But according to the results, on strain B, more plasmids were present than on strain K, leading to more deaths.\n\nWait, but the data shows that on strain B, 40 colonies died, and on strain K, 4 colonies died. That suggests that on strain B, the lysogenic phages were more effective, leading to more plasmids and thus more infections. On strain K, the lysogenic phages didn't do as well, resulting in fewer infections.\n\nSo the key here is the difference in the number of plasmids per cell between the two strains. The ratio of plasmids per cell on strain B vs. K will tell us how much recombination occurs.\n\nRecombination refers to the exchange of genetic information between two regions. Here, the two mutations (mutant X and Y) are in the same T4 phage gene region. If they are recombined, it would mean that the product of one mutation interacts with the product of another, potentially affecting their replication efficiency.\n\nThe number of plasmids per cell can be modeled using the concept of recombination frequency. If there is recombination, the plasmid copy number can be calculated from the number of plasmids observed in the two strains.\n\nThe formula to calculate the recombination frequency (F) is:\n\nF = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nBut in our case, we're dealing with the ratio of plasmids per cell. Let's denote P_B as the average plasmid density on strain B, and P_K as that on strain K.\n\nIf the two mutants are unlinked (no recombination), then P_B would equal P_K, because both mutations are independent. If they are recombined, the plasmids produced by each mutation would be different, leading to a difference in plasmid density between the two strains.\n\nHowever, in reality, when two mutations are present and can recombine, the expected plasmid density in the population is a weighted average based on the recombination frequency. So the average plasmid density across all cells would be P_avg = (1 - F) * P_X + F * P_Y, where F is the fraction of cells that have recombined products.\n\nBut in our case, the majority of the colonies are dead on strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage was more common there. Therefore, P_B > P_K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on strain B than on K.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nAssuming that the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more plasmids, and the non-lytic phages don't, the difference in plasmid densities can help estimate the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that 40 colonies died on B and 4 on K, we can infer that the lysogenic phage caused more plasmids on B, hence more infections. The exact relationship depends on the recombination rate.\n\nThe simplest way to model this is to assume that the difference in plasmid density corresponds to the recombination frequency. If there's complete recombination (F=1), then P_B = P_Y and P_K = P_X, making P_B = P_K. But since P_B > P_K, F must be less than 1.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of recombinants, we can set up an equation based on the observed plasmid densities.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- R = number of recombinant plasmids\n- T = total number of plasmids\n\nWe know that:\nP_B = (T - R)/T\nP_K = R/T\n\nFrom the experiment, P_B = 40/(N_B) and P_K = 4/(N_K), where N_B and N_K are the number of colonies on each strain. But since N_B and N_K are large (as they are plate counts), we can approximate P_B \u2248 40/N_B and P_K \u2248 4/N_K.\n\nAssuming that the total number of plasmids T is similar for both strains (which may not be strictly true but simplifies calculations), we can write:\n\nP_B = (T - R)/T\nP_K = R/T\n\nSubtracting the two equations gives P_B - P_K = (T - R)/T - R/T = (T - R - R)/T = (T - 2R)/T = 1 - (2R)/T\n\nWhich rearranges to (2R)/T = 1 - (P_B - P_K)\n\nBut without knowing T or R, this approach seems tricky. Instead, we can consider the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nSince P_B > P_K, and assuming that the recombination fraction F relates to the proportion of cells that have recombined products, we can relate F to the plasmid densities.\n\nThe ratio of plasmid densities is P_B/P_K = [ (1 - F) * P_X + F * P_Y ] / [ F * P_Y ]\n\nBut without knowing P_X and P_Y, it's hard to proceed directly. An alternative approach is to use the fact that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of recombination, thereby increasing the plasmid density in certain areas.\n\nGiven that the majority of colonies died on B, it suggests that the plasmid density was higher on B, indicating more recombination. To quantify this, we can estimate the recombination frequency using the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency from plasmid density differences is:\n\nF = (P_B - P_K)/(1 - P_K)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, considering that if there is recombination, the expected plasmid density would be a mix of the two parental plasmids.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of heterozygosity. If the two mutations are linked (recombinate), the heterozygous plasmid copy number would differ from the homozygotes. However, without detailed genotypic data, this might not be applicable.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is to recognize that the increase in plasmid density on strain B compared to K indicates a high level of recombination. Given that 40 plasmids died on B and 4 on K, the plasmid density on B is approximately 10 times higher. Assuming that recombination doubles the plasmid density (if one parent is fully intact and the other contributes partially), but this is speculative.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none mention percentages like 1% or 2%. The options include fractions like 0.1%, 0.02%, etc., which are very low. This makes me think that the correct answer is likely a very small recombination frequency, possibly around 0.05%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another angle is to consider that the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1 (40:4). This suggests a significant recombination event, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to pinpoint the percentage.\n\nConsidering the answer options provided, D is 0.05%, which is a very low recombination rate. This aligns with the observation that the lysogenic phage had a greater impact on strain B, implying minimal recombination between the two mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

On strain K, fewer colonies died because the lysogenic phage didn't interact as well, or vice versa.\n\nWait, the setup says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So one half is used on strain B's lawn, and the other half is used on strain K's lawn. After incubation, on strain B's lawn, 40 colonies died, and on strain K's lawn, 4 colonies died. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused more deaths on strain B than on K. Because strain B is where the lysogenic phage was effective, whereas strain K would see less damage.\n\nHmm, wait, but the initial statement said that in the first scenario, only lysogenic phages cause death. So in the first case, all the cells have lysogenic phages, but now both types are present. So in the second experiment, when both are present, the outcome depends on the interaction.\n\nSo in the first half, when plated on strain B, 40 colonies died. That suggests that on strain B, the lysogenic phage caused more deaths. But normally, only lysogenic phages cause death. So perhaps in the presence of lysogenic phages, the lysogenic ones are more efficient at replicating without lysis. So maybe the lysogenic phage has a higher replication rate in the absence of lysis, leading to more plasmids per cell.\n\nIn the second half, when plated on strain K, only 4 colonies died. This implies that the lysogenic phage didn't contribute much in this case. Maybe because strain K's phages are non-lytic, so the lysogenic phage isn't as effective there. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage on strain K wasn't able to replicate without lysis as efficiently as on strain B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants causes some interference, such as competition for resources, reducing the overall number of plasmids per cell. But according to the results, on strain B, more plasmids were present than on strain K, leading to more deaths.\n\nWait, but the data shows that on strain B, 40 colonies died, and on strain K, 4 colonies died. That suggests that on strain B, the lysogenic phages were more effective, leading to more plasmids and thus more infections. On strain K, the lysogenic phages didn't do as well, resulting in fewer infections.\n\nSo the key here is the difference in the number of plasmids per cell between the two strains. The ratio of plasmids per cell on strain B vs. K will tell us how much recombination occurs.\n\nRecombination refers to the exchange of genetic information between two regions. Here, the two mutations (mutant X and Y) are in the same T4 phage gene region. If they are recombined, it would mean that the product of one mutation interacts with the product of another, potentially affecting their replication efficiency.\n\nThe number of plasmids per cell can be modeled using the concept of recombination frequency. If there is recombination, the plasmid copy number can be calculated from the number of plasmids observed in the two strains.\n\nThe formula to calculate the recombination frequency (F) is:\n\nF = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nBut in our case, we're dealing with the ratio of plasmids per cell. Let's denote P_B as the average plasmid density on strain B, and P_K as that on strain K.\n\nIf the two mutants are unlinked (no recombination), then P_B would equal P_K, because both mutations are independent. If they are recombined, the plasmids produced by each mutation would be different, leading to a difference in plasmid density between the two strains.\n\nHowever, in reality, when two mutations are present and can recombine, the expected plasmid density in the population is a weighted average based on the recombination frequency. So the average plasmid density across all cells would be P_avg = (1 - F) * P_X + F * P_Y, where F is the fraction of cells that have recombined products.\n\nBut in our case, the majority of the colonies are dead on strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage was more common there. Therefore, P_B > P_K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on strain B than on K.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nAssuming that the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more plasmids, and the non-lytic phages don't, the difference in plasmid densities can help estimate the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that 40 colonies died on B and 4 on K, we can infer that the lysogenic phage caused more plasmids on B, hence more infections. The exact relationship depends on the recombination rate.\n\nThe simplest way to model this is to assume that the difference in plasmid density corresponds to the recombination frequency. If there's complete recombination (F=1), then P_B = P_Y and P_K = P_X, making P_B = P_K. But since P_B > P_K, F must be less than 1.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of recombinants, we can set up an equation based on the observed plasmid densities.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- R = number of recombinant plasmids\n- T = total number of plasmids\n\nWe know that:\nP_B = (T - R)/T\nP_K = R/T\n\nFrom the experiment, P_B = 40/(N_B) and P_K = 4/(N_K), where N_B and N_K are the number of colonies on each strain. But since N_B and N_K are large (as they are plate counts), we can approximate P_B \u2248 40/N_B and P_K \u2248 4/N_K.\n\nAssuming that the total number of plasmids T is similar for both strains (which may not be strictly true but simplifies calculations), we can write:\n\nP_B = (T - R)/T\nP_K = R/T\n\nSubtracting the two equations gives P_B - P_K = (T - R)/T - R/T = (T - R - R)/T = (T - 2R)/T = 1 - (2R)/T\n\nWhich rearranges to (2R)/T = 1 - (P_B - P_K)\n\nBut without knowing T or R, this approach seems tricky. Instead, we can consider the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nSince P_B > P_K, and assuming that the recombination fraction F relates to the proportion of cells that have recombined products, we can relate F to the plasmid densities.\n\nThe ratio of plasmid densities is P_B/P_K = [ (1 - F) * P_X + F * P_Y ] / [ F * P_Y ]\n\nBut without knowing P_X and P_Y, it's hard to proceed directly. An alternative approach is to use the fact that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of recombination, thereby increasing the plasmid density in certain areas.\n\nGiven that the majority of colonies died on B, it suggests that the plasmid density was higher on B, indicating more recombination. To quantify this, we can estimate the recombination frequency using the ratio of plasmid densities.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency from plasmid density differences is:\n\nF = (P_B - P_K)/(1 - P_K)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, considering that if there is recombination, the expected plasmid density would be a mix of the two parental plasmids.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of heterozygosity. If the two mutations are linked (recombinate), the heterozygous plasmid copy number would differ from the homozygotes. However, without detailed genotypic data, this might not be applicable.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is to recognize that the increase in plasmid density on strain B compared to K indicates a high level of recombination. Given that 40 plasmids died on B and 4 on K, the plasmid density on B is approximately 10 times higher. Assuming that recombination doubles the plasmid density (if one parent is fully intact and the other contributes partially), but this is speculative.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices, none mention percentages like 1% or 2%. The options include fractions like 0.1%, 0.02%, etc., which are very low. This makes me think that the correct answer is likely a very small recombination frequency, possibly around 0.05%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another angle is to consider that the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1 (40:4). This suggests a significant recombination event, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to pinpoint the percentage.\n\nConsidering the answer options provided, D is 0.05%, which is a very low recombination rate. This aligns with the observation that the lysogenic phage had a greater impact on strain B, implying minimal recombination between the two mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

That seems odd because if one mutation is better at causing problems, maybe the more dilute solution should have more success. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the numbers.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully replicated inside the bacterial cell. More plumes mean more infections, meaning more successful replication. So if there are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, the B side has more successful infections. Since one type of phage is causing issues, its presence might increase the chance of replication in the other phage. Alternatively, the recombination could affect the likelihood of successful replication.\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic material during reproduction. In phages, especially when using double-strand break repair, recombination increases the chance of successful lysis or replication. If the two mutants are recombined, their interactions might be more efficient.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the phages are mixed, the outcome depends on whether they cause lytic or lysogenic fission. In the first case, when only lysogenic phages are present, all bacteria die because the phage replicates without lysing. So the lysogenic phage is effective. When both types are present, the less effective phage (lytic) might lead to more lysogenic phages replicating, thus killing more bacteria. However, in the experiment, when the phages are mixed, the E. coli with strain B mostly survives, suggesting that the lysogenic phage was present and killed some, but the lysogenic ones didn't replicate as much, allowing the others to survive more. \n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective than the lytic one. So the recombination must have increased the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. The higher dilution used (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5) probably reflects the fact that when you mix two sets, the chance of combining the two types is higher, leading to more recombination.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant offspring = (number of parental types \u00d7 total offspring) / (parental types + recombinants)\n\nBut here, we're dealing with multiple generations. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinations is given by:\n\nExpected recombinations = (p * q) * (number of trials)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. However, since we're dealing with probabilities, let's think about the probability of recombination being sufficient for the lysogenic phage to replicate effectively.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on B is higher than on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage was more likely to replicate, indicating that the recombination occurred in favor of lysogenic phages. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, we can calculate the percentage of recombinant offspring. Here, the ratio of plumes gives us a clue. Plumes represent the number of successful infections. On B, it's 40, and on K, it's 4. Assuming the total population is the same, the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage was more successful, implying that the recombination increased the efficiency of lysogenic replication.\n\nSo the recombination frequency (rf) can be calculated as:\n\n rf = (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, number of recombinant plumes would be the difference, but wait, I think another approach is needed. Maybe using the equation:\n\n rf = (p * q) / (p + q)\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful infections, and the ratio is 10:1, this implies that the recombination increased the efficiency by a factor of 10. Using the formula for recombination frequency, where:\n\n rf = (n_recomb / n_total) * 100%\n\nIf the ratio is 10:1, then n_recomb is 9 parts (since 10-1=9), and n_total is 11. So rf \u2248 81.8%, which is high. But the options don't go up to 82%. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the relationship between plume counts and recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of plumes that are from the recombined phage is what matters. For example, if the fraction of plumes coming from the recombined phage is 9/10, then rf would be around 81.8%, but again, that's not among the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach: the number of plumes relates to the efficiency of replication. If the lysogenic phage is more efficient, then the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. Because when two mutations are recombined, the efficiency goes up quadratically. \n\nLet\u2019s denote rf as x. Then the number of plumes would be proportional to x\u00b2. From the data, the ratio of plumes is 40:B vs 4:K, which is 10:1. So 10\u00b2 = 100, and 1\u00b2 = 1. Thus, x\u00b2 / 1\u00b2 = 100/1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 x = 10. But that's impossible because recombination cannot exceed 100%.\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right. Perhaps I inverted the ratio. If the lysogenic phage had higher efficiency, then the number of plumes would be higher on the lysogenic side. So perhaps the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1, meaning that the recombination made the lysogenic phage more efficient by a factor of 10. So using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes \u221d (efficiency)^2\n\nThus, (efficiency_K / efficiency_B)^2 = 100 \u21d2 efficiency_K / efficiency_B = 10 \u21d2 efficiency_K = 10 efficiency_B\n\nBut this still doesn't directly give me the recombination frequency. Alternatively, the formula for recombination frequency when two mutations are involved is often approximated by rf = (number of recombinant individuals - 1)/(total individuals - 2), but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of recombination. If the ratio of plumes is 10:1, then the probability of recombination is sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, which is over 300%, which isn't possible either.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plumes corresponds to the product of the two mutation frequencies. If rf is r, then the expected number of recombinants is (r * p * q). But I'm not certain.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best way is to look for the standard calculation for recombination frequency based on plume counts. From what I recall, when two mutations interfere, the number of recombinants increases. The formula for recombination frequency when interference occurs is:\n\n rf = 1 - e^{-2r}\n\nwhere r is the recombination frequency. Solving for rf:\n\ne^{-2r} = 1 - rf\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-2r = ln(1 - rf)\n\nr = -0.5 * ln(1 - rf)\n\nBut without knowing rf, this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio of plumes as an approximation. If the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination is approximately 10% because 10:1 is close to 1:0.1, but I'm not confident.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the correct answer is supposed to be among the options provided. Given that, and considering common values, 0.05% (option J) or 0.02% (option I) comes to mind, as these are small fractions indicating low recombination. However, my earlier reasoning suggested a higher rf, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula considers the combined effect. If the two mutations interfere, the recombination frequency increases. The formula for interference is:\n\n rf = 1 - e^{-2r}\n\nBut in our case, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4, giving a ratio of 10:1. If we consider that the recombination leads to more efficient replication, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (recombinant plumes) = (original plumes) * (1 + rf). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes would be N * (1 + rf), assuming that rf leads to more plumes. So if N is the original population, then N*(1 + rf) = observed plumes.

However, in the presence of the lysogenic phage, the E. coli might have already been lysed by another phage, so the lysogenic phage has a chance to infect again. But in the case where both mutation types are present, maybe the lysogenic phage can only infect certain parts of the genome, leading to recombinant fission events.\n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the T_4 genome is recombined. Recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to integrate into regions where the lysogenic phage from the other mutation type can act.

This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into 10% of the genomic regions compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K, who only integrated 1%. That implies that 90% of the genome remains unchanged, and 10% was recombined.\n\nSo, the percentage of recombination would be 10%, but looking at the options provided, none have 10%. The closest higher option is G (0.5%) and H (5%). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the recombination rate is calculated differently. Maybe it's based on the efficiency of cross-recruitment or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of successful infections without any recombination would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of integration for each phage. If p is the fraction of the genome recombined, then the probability of integration for each phage would be p for B and (1-p) for K? Or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the presence of recombination, the probability of integrating into a specific genomic region is increased. Suppose that normally, the lysogenic phage would integrate into 1% of the genome, giving 1% successful infections. But due to recombination, it integrates into 1 + r % of the genome, giving (1 + r)/100 * 100% successful infections.\n\nGiven that, we have 40 on B and 4 on K. Let's assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would integrate into 1% of the genome, so 1% of the population would lead to 1% of the plumes. But here, on B, we see 40 plumes, which is 4 times as many as expected without recombination. On K, we see 4 plumes. Without recombination, K would have only 1% plumes, so 4 would imply 4/0.01=400 times more than expected. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, maybe the reciprocal. If the lysogenic phage from K integrates into x% of the genome, then the expected number of plumes on K would be x% of the population. Here, K shows 4 plumes. If x is 0.04 (4%), that makes sense if without recombination, K would have 1% plumes. But now, with recombination, K's plumes increase to 4%.\n\nSimilarly, on B, without recombination, B would have 1% plumes (since lysogenic phage integrates into 1% of the genome), but we see 40 plumes, which is 40 times more. That suggests that the recombination significantly increases the likelihood of integration.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let p be the fraction of the genome recombined. Then, the probability of integration for the lysogenic phage from B is q = 1 - p (assuming 1% baseline, but perhaps without recombination, the integration is 1%, and with recombination, it's 1 + p%). Alternatively, maybe the recombination increases the integration efficiency.\n\nIf the baseline integration is 1% (q = 0.01), and with recombination, it becomes q + delta, then the expected number of plumes on B would be (q + delta) / q * original plumes. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the ratio of plumes on B to K. Since the total population is the same, the ratio of plumes should reflect the ratio of successful infections. On B, it's 40, on K, 4. So, 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the success rate on B is 10 times better than on K. If the success rate is proportional to the square root of the recombination rate, then sqrt(r) = 10, so r = 100. That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe it's linear. If the success rate on B is 10 times better, then the recombination rate is such that the integration probability for B is 10 times higher. If without recombination, the integration probability is 1%, then with recombination, it's 10%: 10% vs 1% gives a 10x increase, matching the observed data. Therefore, the recombination rate is 90% of the genome being recombined.\n\nWait, no. If the integration probability increases by 90%, then it's 1% + 0.9% = 1.9%. But that's speculative. Alternatively, if the recombination increases the integration probability by a factor of 10, then the base integration is 1%, and with recombination, it's 10%, making the ratio 10:1.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is 90%, but that's not one of the options. The options go down to 0.002%. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The difference in plume counts reflects the difference in integration efficiencies. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- For B: S_B = 40\n- For K: S_K = 4\n- Total population N is the same for both.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the integration probabilities are p_B and p_K.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages successfully integrated into the K strain's genome. Similarly, 40 on B indicates 40 successful infections on B. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the lytic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, meaning it can't replicate inside the E. coli. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage might integrate into the genome, causing lytic fission. However, in the presence of the lysogenic phage, the E. coli might have already been lysed by another phage, so the lysogenic phage has a chance to infect again. But in the case where both mutation types are present, maybe the lysogenic phage can only infect certain parts of the genome, leading to recombinant fission events.\n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the T_4 genome is recombined. Recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to integrate into regions where the lysogenic phage from the other mutation type can act. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B can integrate into the genomic regions where the lysogenic phage from strain K is active, allowing for new fission events.\n\nThe number of plumes (infections) depends on the efficiency of integration. If the two phages' mutations are recombined, then the probability of integration increases because the phages are more compatible in their genetic material. In the absence of recombination, each phage would integrate independently, leading to fewer successful infections. With recombination, the integration is more efficient, so you'd expect more successful infections overall.\n\nIn the experiment, the total number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K.

If multiple phages infect the same bacterium, you get a single plume of colonies. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 phages from strain K's sample successfully lysed E. coli. Similarly, 40 plumes on B mean 40 phages from strain B's sample lysed E. coli. \n\nBut wait, the initial description says that when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage might have a different effect than the lytic one. However, the presence of both mutants could lead to some interference where their effects combine, possibly causing double-lysis events or interactions.\n\nNow, the key point here is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two strands during replication. In the context of T_4 phages, recombination would occur if the two mutations (one causing lysogenic activity, the other causing lytic activity) are on the same DNA strand. Normally, for two identical mutations to cause different effects, like one causing lysogeny and the other causing lysis, you wouldn't expect recombination unless there's a specific reason.\n\nIn this experiment, the main finding is that when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic mutation (which should kill the E. coli) isn't as effective when combined with the lytic mutation. This combination might interfere with the lysogenic function, perhaps through recombination, making the lysogenic effect less potent or even non-functional. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage isn't as efficient when it interacts with another type of phage, leading to incomplete killing.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the frequency of successful infections. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, meaning 40 phages killed E. coli. On strain K, 4 plumes, meaning 4 phages killed E. coli. Since strain B is mostly affected, the lysogenic mutation must be interacting with the lytic mutation in such a way that it reduces its effectiveness.\n\nNow, the question asks about the recombination rate between the two mutations. Recombination in phages occurs when the two mutations are on the same DNA strand during replication. For T_4 phages, this usually requires a certain temperature (like 60\u00b0C) and is a common phenomenon. However, the presence of two different mutants complicates things.\n\nIf the two mutations are on the same DNA strand, they will recombine during replication. The frequency of recombination depends on factors like the replication origin, the duration of replication stress, and the time between divisions. In this case, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, the effect on E. coli strain B is reduced. This reduction is likely due to the recombination of the two mutations, leading to a decrease in the lysogenic activity.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can consider the expected number of recombined events. Each phage has two copies of the T_4 genome. If recombination occurs, the two mutations would be swapped. Assuming random recombination, the probability would depend on the number of opportunities for recombination. However, without exact data on replication origins or timing, we can make an educated guess based on the plume counts.\n\nGiven that on strain B, there are 40 plumes and on strain K, 4, this suggests that the lysogenic mutation is being partially inhibited by the lytic mutation. The ratio of plumes (4/40) indicates that the lysogenic mutation is being interfered with at a lower rate on strain B compared to strain K. This interference could be due to recombination, where the lysogenic mutation is being carried over but modified by the lytic mutation.\n\nAssuming that recombination reduces the efficiency of the lysogenic activity, we can estimate the recombination rate. The formula for calculating the recombination rate is:\n\nRecombination Rate = (Number of recombinant phages) / (Total number of phages)\n\nHere, the total number of phages is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinants would be the difference between the expected lysogenic effect without recombination and the observed effect. Without recombination, all lysogenic mutations would be active. With recombination, some lysogenic mutations remain functional while others are lost or modified. The observed effect is 4 plumes, which is less than expected, indicating some loss of lysogenic activity.\n\nHowever, without knowing how many lysogenic mutations remain active, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering the reduced number of plumes on strain B (40 vs 4), it suggests that the lysogenic mutation is being partially inhibited, which could happen due to recombination. The number of plumes inversely relates to the likelihood of recombination. More plumes suggest less inhibition, implying higher recombination rates.\n\nIf we assume that recombination leads to a certain percentage of the lysogenic mutations remaining active, say x%, then the number of plumes would be proportional to x%. Given that strain B has 4 plumes and strain K has 40, the ratio is 1:10.

Conversely, a lysogenic phage might lead to lysogenic fission, so maybe fewer plumes? Or perhaps the presence of different mutations affects the number differently. \n\nThe problem states that the result after splitting was half dilute 1:10^7 on B and another half 1:10^5 on K. Then, on K, 4 plumes were found, and on B, 40. Hmm, wait\u2014no, the wording says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the initial split was into two equal parts. One part (let's say half) is treated as strain B and another half as strain K. Each half is then further diluted. For the B half, it's 1:10^7, meaning fewer phages per well. For the K half, it's 1:10^5. Then, on each lawn, you count the number of plumes. On the B lawn, 40 plumes; on the K lawn, 4. So what's happening here?\n\nWhen a lysogenic phage infects E. coli, it typically leads to a lytic burst, causing the cell to lyse and releasing new phages. This leads to more plumes over time. However, if the phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing (like being a lysogenic phage), it might lyse the phage capsid instead of the bacterial cell. That could reduce the number of plumes because the infection isn't as explosive. \n\nIn this experiment, we have two types of mutants: one that causes lytic fission (dies upon replication) and another that causes lysogenic fission (resists lysing the phage capsid). When both are present, the strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is the dominant type in causing issues. But why is there a difference in plume counts between the two treatments?\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes:\n\n- If a lysogenic phage (mutant A) is used, it will lyse the phage capsid, resulting in few plumes.\n- If a lysogenic phage (mutant B) is used, it will lyse the bacterial cell, causing a lytic burst, leading to many plumes.\n\nSo in the first treatment (strain B lawn), if all the phages were lysogenic, you'd expect many plumes. But in reality, on the B lawn, there were 40 plumes, which is more than expected for a pure lysogenic phage. However, the second treatment (strain K lawn) had only 4 plumes, which seems low because lysogenic phages usually cause more plumes. Maybe strain K is resistant to lysogeny, or perhaps the phage has been transformed differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage is T_4, which is typically lysogenic. So if both mutant types are lysogenic, using a strain B lawn should show more plumes due to the lytic burst. But in this case, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, while the K lawn shows 4. That suggests that strain K is not as susceptible, perhaps because the lysogenic phage is more likely to lyse the bacterial cell rather than just the phage capid. Alternatively, maybe the strain B is a mix, but the result suggests that only some of the mutants are causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the mutation in strain A (mutant A) causes less plumes, and strain B causes more. So in the first treatment (strain B), where all mutants are lysogenic, you get more plumes than expected from a single mutation. In the second treatment (strain K), where the mutation may be different, you get fewer plumes.\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination between the two mutations? Recombination refers to whether the mutations interact during replication. If they recombine, the effect might differ. For example, if the lysogenic phage can copy its own DNA, allowing it to integrate into the host genome, then the presence of one mutation might influence the replication of the other.\n\nIn the context of phage mutations, recombination can affect the ability of the phage to replicate within the host. If the two mutations are independent, their effects add up multiplicatively. If they are recombined, the effects might be additive or even subtractive depending on the nature of the mutations.\n\nGiven the results, let's consider the expected outcome if only one mutation occurred. Suppose strain A (mutant A) is a lysogenic phage with a mutation that makes it non-recombining. Strain B (mutant B) is a lysogenic phage with a mutation that allows recombination. Using strain B as the lawn, expecting more plumes due to the lysogenic fission.\n\nHowever, in our case, on the B lawn, there were 40 plumes, which is higher than expected for a purely lysogenic phage. On the K lawn, with 4 plumes, it's lower than expected. This suggests that K is resistant to the lysogenic fission, possibly due to the mutation in strain A making it non-yielding. Alternatively, K might be a strain that doesn't respond well to lysogenic phage mutations.\n\nBut focusing on recombination: if the two mutations were recombined, the effect on the phage's activity would change. Normally, recombination would allow the phage to replicate more efficiently, potentially increasing the number of plumes. However, in this scenario, the K sample shows fewer plumes, which contradicts recombination. Unless the recombination reduces the lysogenic fission activity, leading to fewer plumes. But that's counterintuitive.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of lysogenic fission. If the phage integrates its DNA into the host genome, the lysogenic fission might become less efficient because the phage becomes a better integrator. Alternatively, the recombination could disrupt the lysogenic cycle, making it harder for the phage to lyse the bacterial cell.\n\nIn any case, the key point is to determine the proportion of recombination events between the two mutations. The data provided suggests that one mutation is more effective at causing lysis than the other. Since strain B showed more plumes, it implies that the lysogenic phage (mutant B) caused more damage than the lysogenic phage with recombination (mutant A).\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula: Recombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Genes / Total Genes) * 100%. However, in the context of phage mutations, the recombination frequency would indicate how often the two mutations occurred together during replication.\n\nLooking back at the experiment, the main variable is the presence of recombination. If the two mutations were recombined, the resulting phage would be more efficient in lysogenic fission, leading to more plumes. But in our case, the B lawn had more plumes, which fits with the lysogenic phage having recombination. The K lawn, however, had fewer plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic phage in K didn't cause as much damage, possibly because the recombination disrupted the lysogenic cycle.\n\nTherefore, the presence of recombination indicates that the two mutations occurred together during replication, enhancing the lysogenic fission activity. To quantify this, we can estimate the frequency of recombination. Given that recombination increases the efficiency of lysogenic fission, and the observed increase in plumes aligns with this, the recombination rate must be significant enough to account for the observed differences.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs once during replication, the probability of recombination is calculated based on the observed plume counts. However, without exact numbers of recombinants and non-combinants, it's challenging to compute the precise frequency. But given the options, we're looking for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nAmong the options, G is 0.5 percent, F is 0.3 percent, etc. Considering that the plume count increased significantly, indicating that recombination occurred frequently. If recombination happened in about 5% of cases, that would fit the observed trend.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage with recombination produces twice as many plumes as the non-recombinant one, then the recombination frequency would be high. Let's assume that if recombination happens once, the plume count doubles. So if the non-recombinant phage produces x plumes, the recombinant would produce 2x. Comparing to the observed data, the B lawn had 40 plumes, which is much higher than the expected 2x if only one mutation existed. However, if only one mutation exists, you wouldn't see such a high number unless the mutation itself is highly efficient, which might suggest a low recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on the B lawn, 40 plumes are observed, and assuming that the lysogenic phage with recombination produces twice as many plumes as the non-recombinant, then the non-recombinant would produce 20 plumes. Similarly, on the K lawn, 4 plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage without recombination produces 8 plumes. Therefore, the ratio of plumes between the two samples is 40 vs. 4, which is a 10-fold difference. Assuming that this corresponds to a factor of 2 in plume production (due to recombination), the recombination frequency must be sufficient to double the plume count from the non-recombinant to the recombinant.\n\nIf the non-recombinant produces 20 plumes, and the recombinant produces 40, then the recombination frequency is 100%, meaning all instances resulted in recombination. But that's unlikely, as the answer choices don't include 100%. Perhaps the relationship is inverse. If the non-recombinant produces more plumes, then the recombination decreases the number.\n\nWait, let's clarify: If recombination increases the plume count, then the non-recombinant would produce fewer plumes. So if the non-recombinant produces x plumes, the recombinant produces 2x. Observing 40 plumes on the B lawn and 4 on the K lawn, the ratio is 10 times. Assuming that the recombinant is 2x and the non-recombinant is x, and the difference between them is 9x (since 2x - x = x, but in the data, it's 40 - 4 = 36, which is 9x, implying x=4). Thus, the non-recombinant produces 4 plumes, the recombinant produces 8. But in reality, the B lawn shows 40, which is way higher than 8. So my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the relationship is exponential. If recombination doubles the plume count each time, then starting from the non-recombinant (x), the recombinant is 2x, and the next generation would be 4x, etc. If the B lawn has 40 plumes, which is 10x the non-recombinant, that would imply log2(10) \u2248 3.3 generations of recombination, which is around 33% recombination. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the B lawn has 40 plumes, which is 10 times the expected from a single mutation, and the K lawn has 4, which is 1/10th, the recombination must have reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. If recombination reduces the plume count by a factor of r, then 40 / (r^n) = 4, where n is the number of recombination events. Solving for r, we get r = (40/4)^(1/n) = 10^(1/n). Assuming n=1, r=10, which would mean complete recombination, which is unlikely. If n=2, r=\u221a10\u22483.16, still too high. If n=3, r\u224810^(1/3)=~2.15. Still too high. If n=4, r\u224810^(1/4)=~1.78. Closer, but not ideal. If n=5, r\u224810^(1/5)=~1.58. Still above 1. If n=6, ~1.44. Continuing down: n=10, ~1.258. n=20, ~1.07. So approximately 20 recombination events, which is unreasonable. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes produced. So, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with recombination (mutant A) causes 10 times as many plumes as the lysogenic phage without recombination (mutant B). Therefore, the recombination must have occurred in 100% of the cases, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 2%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but 100% is not among the options. The highest option is H, which is 5%. Option G is 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is the reciprocal of the ratio. Since the B lawn has 10 times as many plumes, the recombination frequency would be 1 - (1/10) = 0.9, which is 90%, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination frequency is 1 - (1/10) = 0.9, which again isn't an option. But none of the options reach 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think in terms of the likelihood of recombination. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected plume count would depend on R. For instance, if R is 50%, then the lysogenic phage with recombination would have a certain efficiency. Without knowing the exact model, perhaps the best approach is to look for the most straightforward calculation.\n\nGiven that the B lawn has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. If this is due to recombination, perhaps each recombination event increases the plume count by a factor of 10. So if the original non-recombinant produces x plumes, the recombinant produces 10x, and the next generation would produce 100x, etc. Starting from x, if you have 40 plumes on B, that's 10x, so x=4. Then, the K sample has 4 plumes, which is x, meaning that the non-recombinant produces 4 plumes. So, if the non-recombinant produces 4, the recombinant produces 40, which is 10 times. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be 100%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is about 1%, corresponding to option D. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10:1, and the recombination frequency is roughly 1%, then it fits.\n\nWait, but 10:1 would require 100% recombination. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider that the difference in plume counts reflects the recombination frequency. If the B lawn has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10, then the recombination frequency is 100%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 1%, which is option D. Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation requires taking logarithms.\n\nTaking natural logs: ln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3. If the recombination frequency R satisfies ln(R) = -2.3, then R \u2248 e^(-2.3) \u2248 0.1, which is 1%. So the recombination frequency is 1%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio suggested 100% recombination, but according to the calculation, it's 1%. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the recombination frequency isn't directly proportional to the ratio of plumes. Instead, it's more about the efficiency gain. If recombination doubles the plume count, then the ratio is 2:1. If the B lawn has 40 and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1, which would correspond to R = 100%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the difference in plume counts is due to recombination, and thus the recombination frequency is 1%, leading to the plume counts differing by a factor of 10.\n\nGiven the available options, the most plausible answer is D, 0.1 percent, but I'm uncertain because the calculation suggests 1%, which is closer to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). However, 1% isn't an option except for D. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio of plumes. If the ratio is 10:1, the square root is sqrt(10)\u22483.16, which would correspond to about 3% recombination. But that's also not an option. Alternatively, the square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, but none of the options match exactly. \n\nConsidering the options, the closest is option D (0.1%) or option G (0.5%). Another angle is to note that the difference in plume counts is quite large (10-fold), which suggests a high recombination frequency. However, none of the options go beyond 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula: Recombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Events)/(Total Events). If the observed plume counts reflect the number of recombination events, then the ratio of plumes can help determine the frequency.\n\nFor example, if on the B lawn, there are 40 plumes, and on the K lawn, 4, the ratio is 10:1. If each recombination event contributes to this ratio, then the number of recombination events is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio. Taking log base 10, log10(10) = 1, which suggests 100% recombination, but that",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if the phage is lysogenic, it would cause a lytic burst, resulting in multiple phages lysing the target cell, leading to many plumes. Conversely, a lysogenic phage might lead to lysogenic fission, so maybe fewer plumes? Or perhaps the presence of different mutations affects the number differently. \n\nThe problem states that the result after splitting was half dilute 1:10^7 on B and another half 1:10^5 on K. Then, on K, 4 plumes were found, and on B, 40. Hmm, wait\u2014no, the wording says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the initial split was into two equal parts. One part (let's say half) is treated as strain B and another half as strain K. Each half is then further diluted. For the B half, it's 1:10^7, meaning fewer phages per well. For the K half, it's 1:10^5. Then, on each lawn, you count the number of plumes. On the B lawn, 40 plumes; on the K lawn, 4. So what's happening here?\n\nWhen a lysogenic phage infects E. coli, it typically leads to a lytic burst, causing the cell to lyse and releasing new phages. This leads to more plumes over time. However, if the phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lysing (like being a lysogenic phage), it might lyse the phage capsid instead of the bacterial cell. That could reduce the number of plumes because the infection isn't as explosive. \n\nIn this experiment, we have two types of mutants: one that causes lytic fission (dies upon replication) and another that causes lysogenic fission (resists lysing the phage capsid). When both are present, the strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is the dominant type in causing issues. But why is there a difference in plume counts between the two treatments?\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes:\n\n- If a lysogenic phage (mutant A) is used, it will lyse the phage capsid, resulting in few plumes.\n- If a lysogenic phage (mutant B) is used, it will lyse the bacterial cell, causing a lytic burst, leading to many plumes.\n\nSo in the first treatment (strain B lawn), if all the phages were lysogenic, you'd expect many plumes. But in reality, on the B lawn, there were 40 plumes, which is more than expected for a pure lysogenic phage. However, the second treatment (strain K lawn) had only 4 plumes, which seems low because lysogenic phages usually cause more plumes. Maybe strain K is resistant to lysogeny, or perhaps the phage has been transformed differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phage is T_4, which is typically lysogenic. So if both mutant types are lysogenic, using a strain B lawn should show more plumes due to the lytic burst. But in this case, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, while the K lawn shows 4. That suggests that strain K is not as susceptible, perhaps because the lysogenic phage is more likely to lyse the bacterial cell rather than just the phage capid. Alternatively, maybe the strain B is a mix, but the result suggests that only some of the mutants are causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the mutation in strain A (mutant A) causes less plumes, and strain B causes more. So in the first treatment (strain B), where all mutants are lysogenic, you get more plumes than expected from a single mutation. In the second treatment (strain K), where the mutation may be different, you get fewer plumes.\n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination between the two mutations? Recombination refers to whether the mutations interact during replication. If they recombine, the effect might differ. For example, if the lysogenic phage can copy its own DNA, allowing it to integrate into the host genome, then the presence of one mutation might influence the replication of the other.\n\nIn the context of phage mutations, recombination can affect the ability of the phage to replicate within the host. If the two mutations are independent, their effects add up multiplicatively. If they are recombined, the effects might be additive or even subtractive depending on the nature of the mutations.\n\nGiven the results, let's consider the expected outcome if only one mutation occurred. Suppose strain A (mutant A) is a lysogenic phage with a mutation that makes it non-recombining. Strain B (mutant B) is a lysogenic phage with a mutation that allows recombination. Using strain B as the lawn, expecting more plumes due to the lysogenic fission.\n\nHowever, in our case, on the B lawn, there were 40 plumes, which is higher than expected for a purely lysogenic phage. On the K lawn, with 4 plumes, it's lower than expected. This suggests that K is resistant to the lysogenic fission, possibly due to the mutation in strain A making it non-yielding. Alternatively, K might be a strain that doesn't respond well to lysogenic phage mutations.\n\nBut focusing on recombination: if the two mutations were recombined, the effect on the phage's activity would change. Normally, recombination would allow the phage to replicate more efficiently, potentially increasing the number of plumes. However, in this scenario, the K sample shows fewer plumes, which contradicts recombination. Unless the recombination reduces the lysogenic fission activity, leading to fewer plumes. But that's counterintuitive.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of lysogenic fission. If the phage integrates its DNA into the host genome, the lysogenic fission might become less efficient because the phage becomes a better integrator. Alternatively, the recombination could disrupt the lysogenic cycle, making it harder for the phage to lyse the bacterial cell.\n\nIn any case, the key point is to determine the proportion of recombination events between the two mutations. The data provided suggests that one mutation is more effective at causing lysis than the other. Since strain B showed more plumes, it implies that the lysogenic phage (mutant B) caused more damage than the lysogenic phage with recombination (mutant A).\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula: Recombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Genes / Total Genes) * 100%. However, in the context of phage mutations, the recombination frequency would indicate how often the two mutations occurred together during replication.\n\nLooking back at the experiment, the main variable is the presence of recombination. If the two mutations were recombined, the resulting phage would be more efficient in lysogenic fission, leading to more plumes. But in our case, the B lawn had more plumes, which fits with the lysogenic phage having recombination. The K lawn, however, had fewer plumes, which suggests that the lysogenic phage in K didn't cause as much damage, possibly because the recombination disrupted the lysogenic cycle.\n\nTherefore, the presence of recombination indicates that the two mutations occurred together during replication, enhancing the lysogenic fission activity. To quantify this, we can estimate the frequency of recombination. Given that recombination increases the efficiency of lysogenic fission, and the observed increase in plumes aligns with this, the recombination rate must be significant enough to account for the observed differences.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs once during replication, the probability of recombination is calculated based on the observed plume counts. However, without exact numbers of recombinants and non-combinants, it's challenging to compute the precise frequency. But given the options, we're looking for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nAmong the options, G is 0.5 percent, F is 0.3 percent, etc. Considering that the plume count increased significantly, indicating that recombination occurred frequently. If recombination happened in about 5% of cases, that would fit the observed trend.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage with recombination produces twice as many plumes as the non-recombinant one, then the recombination frequency would be high. Let's assume that if recombination happens once, the plume count doubles. So if the non-recombinant phage produces x plumes, the recombinant would produce 2x. Comparing to the observed data, the B lawn had 40 plumes, which is much higher than the expected 2x if only one mutation existed. However, if only one mutation exists, you wouldn't see such a high number unless the mutation itself is highly efficient, which might suggest a low recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on the B lawn, 40 plumes are observed, and assuming that the lysogenic phage with recombination produces twice as many plumes as the non-recombinant, then the non-recombinant would produce 20 plumes. Similarly, on the K lawn, 4 plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage without recombination produces 8 plumes. Therefore, the ratio of plumes between the two samples is 40 vs. 4, which is a 10-fold difference. Assuming that this corresponds to a factor of 2 in plume production (due to recombination), the recombination frequency must be sufficient to double the plume count from the non-recombinant to the recombinant.\n\nIf the non-recombinant produces 20 plumes, and the recombinant produces 40, then the recombination frequency is 100%, meaning all instances resulted in recombination. But that's unlikely, as the answer choices don't include 100%. Perhaps the relationship is inverse. If the non-recombinant produces more plumes, then the recombination decreases the number.\n\nWait, let's clarify: If recombination increases the plume count, then the non-recombinant would produce fewer plumes. So if the non-recombinant produces x plumes, the recombinant produces 2x. Observing 40 plumes on the B lawn and 4 on the K lawn, the ratio is 10 times. Assuming that the recombinant is 2x and the non-recombinant is x, and the difference between them is 9x (since 2x - x = x, but in the data, it's 40 - 4 = 36, which is 9x, implying x=4). Thus, the non-recombinant produces 4 plumes, the recombinant produces 8. But in reality, the B lawn shows 40, which is way higher than 8. So my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the relationship is exponential. If recombination doubles the plume count each time, then starting from the non-recombinant (x), the recombinant is 2x, and the next generation would be 4x, etc. If the B lawn has 40 plumes, which is 10x the non-recombinant, that would imply log2(10) \u2248 3.3 generations of recombination, which is around 33% recombination. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the B lawn has 40 plumes, which is 10 times the expected from a single mutation, and the K lawn has 4, which is 1/10th, the recombination must have reduced the plume count by a factor of 10. If recombination reduces the plume count by a factor of r, then 40 / (r^n) = 4, where n is the number of recombination events. Solving for r, we get r = (40/4)^(1/n) = 10^(1/n). Assuming n=1, r=10, which would mean complete recombination, which is unlikely. If n=2, r=\u221a10\u22483.16, still too high. If n=3, r\u224810^(1/3)=~2.15. Still too high. If n=4, r\u224810^(1/4)=~1.78. Closer, but not ideal. If n=5, r\u224810^(1/5)=~1.58. Still above 1. If n=6, ~1.44. Continuing down: n=10, ~1.258. n=20, ~1.07. So approximately 20 recombination events, which is unreasonable. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes produced. So, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with recombination (mutant A) causes 10 times as many plumes as the lysogenic phage without recombination (mutant B). Therefore, the recombination must have occurred in 100% of the cases, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 2%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but 100% is not among the options. The highest option is H, which is 5%. Option G is 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is the reciprocal of the ratio. Since the B lawn has 10 times as many plumes, the recombination frequency would be 1 - (1/10) = 0.9, which is 90%, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10:1, then the recombination frequency is 1 - (1/10) = 0.9, which again isn't an option. But none of the options reach 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think in terms of the likelihood of recombination. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected plume count would depend on R. For instance, if R is 50%, then the lysogenic phage with recombination would have a certain efficiency. Without knowing the exact model, perhaps the best approach is to look for the most straightforward calculation.\n\nGiven that the B lawn has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. If this is due to recombination, perhaps each recombination event increases the plume count by a factor of 10. So if the original non-recombinant produces x plumes, the recombinant produces 10x, and the next generation would produce 100x, etc. Starting from x, if you have 40 plumes on B, that's 10x, so x=4. Then, the K sample has 4 plumes, which is x, meaning that the non-recombinant produces 4 plumes. So, if the non-recombinant produces 4, the recombinant produces 40, which is 10 times. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be 100%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is about 1%, corresponding to option D. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10:1, and the recombination frequency is roughly 1%, then it fits.\n\nWait, but 10:1 would require 100% recombination. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider that the difference in plume counts reflects the recombination frequency. If the B lawn has 40 plumes and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10, then the recombination frequency is 100%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 1%, which is option D. Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation requires taking logarithms.\n\nTaking natural logs: ln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3. If the recombination frequency R satisfies ln(R) = -2.3, then R \u2248 e^(-2.3) \u2248 0.1, which is 1%. So the recombination frequency is 1%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio suggested 100% recombination, but according to the calculation, it's 1%. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the recombination frequency isn't directly proportional to the ratio of plumes. Instead, it's more about the efficiency gain. If recombination doubles the plume count, then the ratio is 2:1. If the B lawn has 40 and K has 4, the ratio is 10:1, which would correspond to R = 100%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the difference in plume counts is due to recombination, and thus the recombination frequency is 1%, leading to the plume counts differing by a factor of 10.\n\nGiven the available options, the most plausible answer is D, 0.1 percent, but I'm uncertain because the calculation suggests 1%, which is closer to option C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). However, 1% isn't an option except for D. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio of plumes. If the ratio is 10:1, the square root is sqrt(10)\u22483.16, which would correspond to about 3% recombination. But that's also not an option. Alternatively, the square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, but none of the options match exactly. \n\nConsidering the options, the closest is option D (0.1%) or option G (0.5%). Another angle is to note that the difference in plume counts is quite large (10-fold), which suggests a high recombination frequency. However, none of the options go beyond 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula: Recombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Events)/(Total Events). If the observed plume counts reflect the number of recombination events, then the ratio of plumes can help determine the frequency.\n\nFor example, if on the B lawn, there are 40 plumes, and on the K lawn, 4, the ratio is 10:1. If each recombination event contributes to this ratio, then the number of recombination events is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio. Taking log base 10, log10(10) = 1, which suggests 100% recombination, but that",

If they don't recombine, then all lysogenic phages would act on strain B, and none would act on K. But if they do recombine, then some phages might act on both strains. However, the problem states that only strain B is affected when both types are present. That implies that the lysogenic phages from strain B are acting on both strains, perhaps through recombination. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phages from strain K are acting on strain B, but their effect isn't observed because the result shows more activity on B than expected. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWhen both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is most affected, meaning that the lysogenic phages from strain B are causing issues. This suggests that the lysogenic phages from strain K are not causing the issue, possibly because they don't have the mutation necessary for their action. Alternatively, the lysogenic phages from strain K may be acting on strain B due to some recombination, but the result indicates fewer plumes on K than expected. Wait, no\u2014the result says 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. So the majority of infections caused by lysogenic phages from strain B led to lysogeny on strain K as well. That seems unlikely unless the phages are recombining. \n\nWait, another approach: the number of plumes depends on the probability of recombination. If the two regions recombine at a rate r, then the probability that a lysogenic phage from strain B crosses over with a lysogenic phage from strain K is approximately r (assuming random distribution). Each such crossing leads to both phages acting on the same host, resulting in more plumes. Conversely, non-recombined phages cause separate infections, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that the experiment has 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, we can model this as follows: without any recombination, all 40 lysogenic phages from B would independently infect K, leading to 40 plumes. With recombination, some of those 40 would also infect K via recombination, reducing the total number of plumes on K. Let\u2019s denote the number of recombined events as x. Then, the expected number of plumes on K would be 40*(1 - x/40), where x ranges from 0 to 40. Similarly, the number of plumes on B would remain 40 if there's no recombination, or higher if there was recombination, but in reality, B is less affected, so perhaps the opposite? Wait, no\u2014strain B is the one being primarily affected. So if there's recombination, the lysogenic phages from B could infect K, making K more likely to be lysed, hence more plumes. But according to the data, K has only 4 plumes, while B has 40. That suggests that with recombination, the number of plumes on K decreases compared to the case without recombination. Therefore, the presence of recombination reduces the number of plumes on K.\n\nLet me set up the equations. Without recombination, the number of plumes on K would be 40. With recombination, let\u2019s say each recombination event (x) reduces the number of independent infections on K by x. So the expected number of plumes on K would be 40*(1 - x/40). We observe 4 plumes on K, so:\n\n4 = 40*(1 - x/40)\n=> 4/40 = 1 - x/40\n=> 0.1 = 1 - x/40\n=> x/40 = 0.9\n=> x = 36\n\nSo 36 recombination events occurred out of 40 possible. The recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as (number of recombinant events)/(total number of potential events). Here, the total number of potential events is the product of the concentrations of the two mutant types. The concentration of strain B's lysogenic phages is about 1e-4 per ml, and strain K's is similar. So the total potential events would be 1e-8 per ml\u00b2. The actual number of recombination events is 36 per ml\u00b2. Thus, rf = (36)/(1e-8) * 1e-8 = 36/(1e-8)*1e-8=36. Wait, that can\u2019t be right. Wait, the formula is rf = (observed recombinations)/(expected recombinations). Expected recombinations would be (concentration of B mutant) * (concentration of K mutant) * (recombination rate). Since the concentrations are both ~1e-4, the expected recombinations would be (1e-4)*(1e-4)=1e-8. Observed is 36 per ml\u00b2, so rf=36 / 1e-8=3.6e9, which is way too high. Clearly, my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombination events is proportional to the product of the concentrations times the rf. Let me define rf as the fraction of potential recombination events. Then, the observed number of recombination events x = (concentration_B * concentration_K * rf). Given that concentration_B and concentration_K are both ~1e-4, then x \u2248 (1e-4)(1e-4)rf = 1e-8 rf. From earlier, x=36, so 36 = 1e-8 rf => rf = 36e8 = 3.6e9%. That's impossible because rf cannot exceed 100%. Clearly, this method isn't working. Maybe I should consider the probability differently.\n\nAnother approach: the probability that a single lysogenic phage from strain B recombines with one from strain K is rf. The number of recombination events is x = N * rf, where N is the total number of potential recombination events, which is (concentration_B * concentration_K) * (total volume)^2. Assuming dilution factors, perhaps the relevant volume is the volume used for each plating, which is 1e7 or 1e5. Alternatively, considering the concentrations before dilution, the number of potential recombination events is (1e-4 phages/ml) * (1e-4 phages/ml) * (volume in ml)^2. For example, if each plating uses 1 ml, then N = (1e-4)^2 * (1)^2 = 1e-8 potential recombination events. Then, the expected number of recombination events x = N * rf = 1e-8 rf. Observing x=36 gives rf = 36 / 1e-8 = 3.6e9%, which is still too high. \n\nThis suggests that either the initial assumption is incorrect, or perhaps the recombination rate is much lower. Alternatively, maybe the model needs to account for the fact that each plating event is a test for recombination, and the probability that a given plating event results in recombination is rf. Then, the expected number of recombination events across all plating trials would be rf multiplied by the total number of plating trials. But without knowing the exact numbers, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 40*(1 - rf) = 4. Solving for rf: 1 - rf = 4/40 = 0.1 => rf=0.9, which is 90% recombination. That seems high but matches the data. However, looking back at the options provided, the highest rf mentioned is 5%, so this suggests I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is rf = x / (N), where N is the total number of potential recombination events. If N is 1e-8 and x=36, then rf=36 /1e-8=3.6e9%, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4=10:1, indicating that recombination reduced the probability of lysogeny on K by a factor of 10. Since the recombination frequency is typically measured as (1 - p), where p is the probability of no recombination, then if the number of plumes on K is 4 instead of 40, the probability of recombination p is 3/4 = 0.75. Thus, rf = 1 - p = 0.25. But looking at the options, 0.05% corresponds to 0.0005, which is very low, whereas 0.25% is 0.0025. Hmm, this doesn't align with the previous reasoning.\n\nPerhaps another angle: the probability that a single lysogenic phage from B recombines with one from K is rf. The probability that both are active is rf. The probability that neither is active is (1 - rf)^2. The probability that exactly one is active is 2rf(1 - rf). In terms of plumes, if both are active, you get more plumes; otherwise, fewer. However, in our case, the number of plumes is inversely related to the likelihood of lysogeny. So, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the likelihood of lysogeny on K is 1/10 that on B, implying that lysogenic phages from B are more likely to cause lysogeny on K than on B. Therefore, rf = 1 - p, where p is the probability of lysogeny on K. If lysogeny on K is 1/10 that on B, and lysogeny on B is 100% (since only B is affected), then lysogeny on K is 10%. Thus, 1 - p = 0.1 => p=0.9, so rf=0.1. Looking at the options, 0.05% is 0.0005, which is much lower. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes on K would be 40*(1 - rf) + 40*rf*(something else). Wait, perhaps the total plumes on K are influenced by both the original lysogeny and any new interactions. If rf is the probability that a phage from B recombines with a phage from K, then the probability that both are active is rf. The probability that exactly one is active is 2(1 - rf)rf. But in terms of lysogeny, if both are active, lysogeny occurs with probability 1; if only one is active, lysogeny occurs with probability 1 as well. Therefore, the overall probability of lysogeny on K would be (1 - rf)^2 + 2rf(1 - rf) = 1 - 2rf + rf^2. But this equals 1 - rf, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the probability of lysogeny on K is (1 - rf) + rf*(probability that lysogeny occurs when only one is active). But this complicates things further.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to recognize that the number of plumes on K is 4, which is 1/10th of 40. This suggests that lysogeny on K is 10% as likely as on B, implying that the recombination rate is 0.1. Converting 0.1 to a percentage gives 10%, which is not among the options. However, looking at the options, the closest is D. 0.05% (0.0005), which is 0.05 parts per million. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, 0.05%, corresponding to rf=0.0005, which would imply that lysogeny on K is 0.0005 of lysogeny on B, which is 4 vs. 40, giving a 10% reduction, matching the observed data. Therefore, the recombination frequency is 0.05%.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the earlier conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the number of plumes on K is 4, which is 10 times fewer than on B. If lysogeny on K is 10% less likely than on B, then the recombination frequency would correspond to a 0.1 decrease in probability. However, the options don't include 0.1%, so perhaps the intended answer is B. 2 percent, but I'm not sure.\n\nAfter reconsidering, I think the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes on K. If the recombination rate is rf, then the expected number of lysogenic phages on K would be (1 - rf) * 40. According to the data, on K, there are 4 plumes. So,\n\n4 = 40 * (1 - rf)\n=> (1 - rf) = 4/40 = 0.1\n=> rf = 0.9\n\nWhich would imply 90% recombination, but that's not an option. Perhaps I've misunderstood the scenario. Alternatively, maybe the number of plumes relates to the square root of the recombination rate. If the observed recombination is sqrt(4/40) = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, which is roughly 31.6%, but that's still not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation is rf = (plumes on K)/(plumes on B)^(1/2) = sqrt(4/40)=sqrt(0.1)=~0.316, which again isn't an option. None of the options match 0.316, so perhaps the intended answer is D. 0.05%, corresponding to rf=0.0005. However, this would lead to lysogeny on K being 0.0005 * lysogeny on B, which is 10% less, matching the observed data. Therefore, despite seeming counterintuitive, the intended answer is likely D. 0.05%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The other half, K half, was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, yielding 4 plumes. \n\nLet me think about this. If the original strain was B, and only the lysogenic phage did damage, then introducing another mutation (from K) should allow some combination. The fact that half of the B half had more plumes (40 vs 4) suggests that those plumes represent successful infections due to the combination of the B mutation and the K mutation. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we often use the formula (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals). Here, the total number of cells after dilution is 50% of B and 50% of K. So each half of the B half (25%) had 40 plumes, and each half of the K half (25%) had 4 plumes. That means 40 out of 50 plumes came from the B-K combination, and 4 from just B or just K.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total number of plumes after dilution is 50% of each half. So each half of the B half (25%) had 40 plumes, and each half of the K half (25%) had 4 plumes. So overall, 40 + 4 = 44 plumes. Out of these, 40 are recombinants, so the ratio is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%.

Treat the same half with low dilution and plate on strain K, getting 4 plumes. Similarly, the other half is treated differently? Or maybe each half is treated separately.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The plate is split into two halves. Each half is then treated with either 1:10^7 or 1:10^5 dilution before being plated on the respective bacterial lawn. \n\nSo, the first half (high dilution) is plated on strain B, giving 40 plumes. The second half (low dilution) is plated on strain K, giving 4 plumes.

The calculation typically uses the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nAssuming each half is treated separately, the total number of plumes is 40 + 4 = 44.

Perhaps the number of plumes corresponds directly to the fraction of recombinants. If the observed number of plumes is higher in one strain compared to the other, it suggests that the phage from the other strain integrated into the phage particle, causing more plasmid insertions.\n\nGiven that, the fraction of plumes on strain K (4) over the total (44) is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which again isn't matching the options. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the cross-over rate as the product of individual rates.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are more plumes on K than on B, maybe it indicates that the lysogenic phage from the B-type mutation has recombined with the phage from the K-type mutation, making a new phage particle that integrates into the host genome.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination in phages usually refers to the process where a lysogenic phage integrates into a phage vector, creating a prophage. In this case, the two mutants are likely combining during replication or transfer. The key here seems to be how their presence affects the outcome when plated on different bacterial lines.\n\nWhen both types are present, the dominant mutation (the lysogenic one) would cause issues, but the presence of the phage from another type might lead to a recombinant phage. However, in the results, the number of plumes on K is much higher than on B. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B-type crossed with the phage from K-type, leading to recombinants. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the result was a saturation divided in half. Half was on strain B and half on K. Then half of that B half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes.

    "rollout": " So 4 on K means 4 infections, and 40 on B means 40 infections.\n\nThe question is about the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Recombination frequency refers to the proportion of recombinant gametes formed during meiosis. In this context, it would be the fraction of times the two mutations occurred together rather than independently.\n\nFrom what I remember, the formula for recombination frequency (RF) is RF = 1 - (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring). However, sometimes it's expressed as RF = (1 - (m x n)) where m and n are the frequencies of each mutation. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test, we can calculate RF from observed counts.\n\nIn this case, let's think about the possible outcomes. Each bacterium can either have both mutations, one mutation, or none. But since the problem states that the presence of two mutants in the same bacterium leads to the lysogenic phage causing lysis (which affects strain B), perhaps only certain combinations lead to specific outcomes.\n\nWhen the phage is lysogenic, it integrates the mutation into the phage's genome, making it lytic. When it's wild-type, it's lysogenic as well, but the lysogenic effect depends on the host's ability to recognize the mutation. If the mutation is present in both strains, it could cause interference or interfere with the lytic activity, leading to different outcomes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if both phages are lysogenic, then each would replicate without interfering, leading to more division and possibly more lysis events. On the other hand, if one is wild-type (lytic) and the other is lysogenic, only the lysogenic one would cause lysis, while the wild-type would not.\n\nBut in the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B shows partial inhibition, meaning some cells are lysed, others are not. That suggests that the lysogenic phages might have an effect on the lysogenic ones, potentially causing some interference. However, since the problem specifically mentions that the lysogenic phage does the lysis, maybe it's due to some kind of competition or interference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination refers to how often the two mutations occur together. For example, if both mutations are present in the phage, they form a recombinant phage that integrates into the genome, and this combination might affect its replication or activity differently.\n\nGiven the data, when the phage is lysogenic (wild-type), it doesn't lyse the E. coli, so those bacteria don't get lysed. When the phage is wild-type, it does lyse, so those bacteria do get lysed. Now, when both types are present, the overall effect is that half the bacteria are lysed, and the other half aren't. This suggests that the presence of both mutations somehow reduces the likelihood of lysing, implying that the mutations interact.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination here would refer to whether the two mutations are present in the phage together or separately. If both mutations are present, they could form a recombinant phage that might have a different activity, such as being more efficient at lysogenizing, thus affecting the outcome.\n\nIn terms of calculation, suppose the expected number of recombinants would follow a certain pattern. If we assume that the mutations are independent, the expected number would be calculated, but here we have observed counts. However, given the way the data was collected, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a lower probability of lysing compared to when only one mutation is present.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose each bacterium has two independent mutations, each occurring with a certain frequency. The combined occurrence would determine the outcome. If both mutations occur, the phage may integrate them, affecting its activity. But in the experiment, the presence of both types led to a mix of infections.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test results, when both types are present, the number of recombinants (where both mutations co-occur) is limited. Since the problem states that only E. coli strain B was affected, perhaps the presence of both mutations reduced the chance of lysing.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the chi-square test for goodness-of-fit. We can compare the observed numbers (4 on K, 40 on B) to the expected numbers under independence.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be less than what you'd expect if they were linked. However, in this scenario, the presence of both mutations caused the E. coli to become partially inhibited, suggesting that the mutations might be interacting, reducing the risk of lysing.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the recombination frequency, which measures how often the two mutations occur together. To calculate that, we might consider the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant cases.\n\nHowever, the experiment seems to involve dilutions and plating on different backgrounds. Maybe the key is that when both mutations are present, the number of recombinants is fewer, indicating a lower recombination frequency.\n\nLooking at the numbers: when the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse; when wild-type, it does. The result after plating on strain B showed 40 infections, while on strain K, 4. So strain B had a higher rate of lysing, implying that the lysogenic phage is more effective against strain B than strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage requires a particular mutation in strain B to function effectively.\n\nPerhaps the recombination refers to how often the two mutations are present together in the phages. If both mutations are rare, their co-occurrence would be low, leading to fewer recombinants. Given that the number of recombinants (infections on strain K) is much lower than expected, it implies that the recombination frequency is low.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRF = 1 - (m * n)\n\nWhere m and n are the probabilities of each mutation. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test statistic:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nWhere O is observed, E is expected under independence.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be:\n\nExpected = Total \u00d7 (1 - m * n)\n\nBut without knowing the exact frequencies of each mutation, it's tricky. However, the fact that the recombination resulted in fewer infections on strain K suggests that the mutations were somewhat related, but not completely.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the results, when both types were present, the number of infections was 4 on K and 40 on B. So strain B had a lot more infections, which could suggest that the lysogenic phage in strain B is more effective, possibly due to a recombination event.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, it would mean that the mutations are more likely to occur together, increasing the chance of co-infection. Conversely, a low recombination frequency would mean that the mutations are rare and unlikely to occur together.\n\nSince the result showed that strain B had more infections (4 vs. 40 on K), it suggests that the lysogenic phage in strain B is more active, which could be due to a recombination event that makes it more effective. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be relatively low.\n\nLooking at the options, the lowest percentage is E (0.02%) and J (0.05%). Considering the data, perhaps around 0.1% makes sense, but the options go down in steps of 0.01%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 1%\n\nB. 2%\n\nC. 1.5%\n\nD. 0.1%\n\nE. 0.02%\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D (0.1%) or E (0.02%).\n\nConsidering the numbers, 4 on K and 40 on B. If the total number of bacteria is N, then on K: 4/N and on B: 40/N. If the expectation under independence is (1 - p*q)*N, where p and q are the mutation rates, but without knowing p and q, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the recombination occurs with a frequency R, then the number of recombinants would be proportional to R. From the observed numbers, the recombination frequency would relate to the difference in the number of infections.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest approach is to note that the recombination frequency corresponds to the number of times the two mutations occurred together versus independently. Since the result showed that strain B had more infections, it suggests that the lysogenic phage in strain B is more likely to integrate the mutation, leading to increased activity. Thus, the recombination frequency is low, likely around 0.1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Actually, when you plate phages on a lawn of E. coli, each phage typically causes one infection event if it successfully infects the bacterium. So in the first case, dilution 1:10^7 means that only 1 phage is present per 10^7 bacteria. If you plate n cells, then you have n phages in solution. Each phage has a probability p of infecting the bacterium. The expected number of plumes (infections) would be \u03bb = n * p. \n\nIn the second case, dilution 1:10^5 means fewer phages per sample, so higher n, hence higher \u03bb. Plated on strain K's lawn gives 40 plumes. Plated on strain B's lawn gives 4. So the ratio of plumes is 4 vs 40, which simplifies to 1:10. That suggests that the dilution efficiency or the probability of infection is different for the two cultures. \n\nSince the two mutations interact, their probabilities of causing infection should multiply. Let's denote p as the probability that a mutation in the lysogenic phage causes lysis (so p_lysis = p), and q as the probability that a mutation in the phage type (mutant) causes lysis. However, wait\u2014no, because the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis, right? Because lysogenic phages replicate inside the host and are passed on. The lysogenic phage's mutation likely affects its replication within the cell, making it less efficient at replicating. So maybe the lysogenic phage has a lower probability of lysis due to mutation, while the phage type (mutant) might have another effect.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII and causes lysis. So perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation makes it more likely to lyse the cell, whereas the phage type (mutant) doesn't carry a mutation related to lysis. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that makes it more efficient at replicating, leading to more successful divisions and thus more lytic fission. While the phage type (mutant) may have a mutation that affects its own replication, such as a mutation in the gene responsible for transducing DNA or something else affecting how it integrates into the host genome.\n\nSo let's model this. Suppose that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that increases its chance of lysis (p_l), and the phage type (mutant) has a mutation that decreases its chance of lysis (q_l). The actual outcome is that when both are present, the combined probability of lysis is p_l * q_l. Alternatively, perhaps they work independently, so the probability of neither being able to lyse is (1 - p_l) * (1 - q_l), meaning the probability of at least one being able to lyse is 1 - (1 - p_l)(1 - q_l).\n\nGiven that the experiment shows that when mixing both types, the fraction of E. coli B that dies is higher than when just one type is used alone. Specifically, when only the lysogenic phage is used, all of strain B die. When both are used together, only 4/40 of the plumes are from strain K, which suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of infection by the phage type (mutant). So the combination leads to a lower overall death rate.\n\nLet me try to calculate the probabilities. Let\u2019s assume that without any mutation, the lysogenic phage would have a certain probability of lysis, say P. Similarly, the phage type (mutant) might have a probability Q of lysis. But when both are present, the phage type (mutant) must now rely on the lysogenic phage for integration. So the effective probability that the phage type (mutant) can lyse becomes P * Q. Therefore, the probability that the phage type (mutant) cannot lyse is 1 - P*Q.\n\nNow, in the experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, all E. coli B die because the lysogenic phage has a high probability of lysis. So when mixed with the phage type (mutant), the phage type (mutant) must fail to lyse in more cases, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nThe observed data is that when both are present, 40 plumes occur on strain B (more deaths) and 4 on strain K. Since strain K is the original host, its death rate should depend on the phage type (mutant)'s ability to lyse without relying on the lysogenic phage. If the lysogenic phage's mutation made it very effective at lysis, then even with the phage type (mutant), it wouldn't contribute much. Conversely, if the phage type (mutant) was already ineffective, adding the lysogenic phage would make things worse.\n\nWait, but the result was that when both are present, 40% of the plumes are on strain B, suggesting that only 4% of E. coli B died compared to 10%. That implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage increased the death rate in strain B, which contradicts what we expect. Unless, perhaps, the lysogenic phage's mutation also affected the phage type (mutant) somehow. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about how the probabilities combine is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation increases its chance of lysis beyond 100%, but that seems unlikely. Maybe instead, the lysogenic phage's mutation reduces the probability of lysis. Wait, but the lysogenic phage is supposed to lyse the cell, so having a mutation that makes it more effective would increase the probability of lysis. Thus, without the lysogenic phage, all of strain B would die because the lysogenic phage can lyse everything. With the lysogenic phage, some E. coli would survive, depending on how many phages are present.\n\nWait, but in reality, the lysogenic phage should integrate into the host genome and replicate. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it more efficient at replicating, then it could lyse fewer cells. So perhaps the mutation in the lysogenic phage increases its chance of lysis, making it more effective at replicating and thus more likely to lyse the cell.\n\nOn the other hand, the phage type (mutant) might have a mutation that disrupts its ability to integrate into the host genome, making it less efficient at integrating and therefore not contributing to lysis. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage can lyse the cell, killing the bacteria, while the phage type (mutant) fails to do so, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nIn that scenario, the probability of lysing is P (from lysogeny) multiplied by Q (from phage type). So if P is high and Q is low, the overall probability is low, leading to fewer total plumes.\n\nFrom the experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, all E. coli die because the lysogenic phage has a high chance of lysis. When both are present, only 40% of the E. coli die, which suggests that the presence of the phage type (mutant) reduced the overall death rate. This could happen if the phage type (mutant) has a low probability of lysis, i.e., Q is low enough that even with P, the product P*Q is low, reducing the chance of lysis.\n\nSo let's model this mathematically.

If you dilute more, you get fewer plumes because each phage has a lower chance of killing the target bacteria. So if you plate a higher dilution (like 1:10^7), you expect fewer plumes. In this case, the first sample was 1:10^7 and had 40 plumes, while the second was 1:10^5 and had 4 plumes.

That makes sense because the second sample is diluted less, meaning more phages are present, leading to more potential infections.

Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage causes some disruption in replication, leading to reduced lytic activity.\n\nBut according to the results, when they plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, but when they plate on strain K, only the wild-type caused issues. Wait, no\u2014actually, the problem states that the lysogenic phage from strain B causes lytic fission (so it dies), but when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage isn't selecting against all the time, but perhaps the combination allows for some selection.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the concept of recombination. Recombination refers to changes in the genetic material due to horizontal transfer events, such as transposons moving within the genome. In this context, the two mutations in the T_4 phage region likely involve disrupting the expression of genes necessary for phage replication or for targeting the lysogenic state.\n\nGiven the results, the phage that causes lysogeny (wild-type mutation) doesn't lyse the cell, so it survives. The lysogenic phage (from strain B) does lyse, so it doesn't survive. Now, when they mix these two types and plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phage is effective, meaning that the wild-type is not sufficient to kill the cells. But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage from strain B causes lytic fission, so it kills the cells. However, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't killing enough, but the wild-type is. Or maybe the opposite?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phage (from strain B): Does not lyse the cell, so it lives and replicates inside.\n- Lysogenic phage (from strain K): Likely the same as above, unless there's a difference.\n- If both types are present, the ones that don't lyse the cell (the lysogenic ones) would replicate inside the cells, potentially causing problems.\n\nNow, in the experiment, when they plate on strain B, the lysogenic phage (assuming it's the same) causes lytic fission, leading to death. But if both types are present, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is more effective, leading to more plasmid replication and less susceptibility. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing more damage than the wild-type, leading to more cell death.\n\nWait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage from strain B causes lytic fission (so dies), but when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. So perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain K is more potent, leading to more cell death, making the overall effect worse on strain B. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain K is being selected against, causing more deaths, leading to fewer plasmids remaining, which affects the growth of the E. coli.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B is being selected against, leading to more plasmid loss, while the wild-type from strain K is not being selected against, leading to more plasmids surviving.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage from strain B is present along with wild-type phages, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cells, so it lives and replicates. Wild-type phages may lyse, so they are less likely to survive. If the lysogenic phage is more effective at replicating, the population of phages carrying the lysogenic mutation will increase, leading to more replication and less susceptibility to the host. Alternatively, if the wild-type is more effective, the lysogenic phages will die off, reducing their ability to replicate, leading to more plasmid loss.\n\nIn the experiment, when they plate on strain B, they saw 40 plumes on the 1:10^7 dilution and 4 on the 1:10^5 dilution. On strain K, they saw 40 on the 1:10^5 and 4 on the 1:10^7. Wait, no, the description says: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" Then four plumes were found on K and 40 on B.\n\nSo, when they plated on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes appeared on the 1:10^7 dilution. When they plated on strain K's lawn, 40 plumes appeared on the 1:10^5 dilution. Wait, that seems inverted. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the first sample (1:10^7) is for strain B, and it shows 40 plumes. The second sample (1:10^5) is for strain K, showing 4 plumes. So when you dilute more (1:10^7), you have fewer plumes, which would suggest more susceptibility. Similarly, when you plate on strain K's lawn (1:10^5), you see fewer plumes, suggesting less susceptibility.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more effective at replicating (producing more phages), leading to more plasmid loss, which reduces the number of viable phages on the host. Therefore, when you plate on strain K's lawn, you see fewer plumes, indicating less susceptibility, implying that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more active, leading to more replication and death.\n\nSimilarly, when you plate on strain B's lawn with the 1:10^7 dilution, you see more plumes (40) compared to the 1:10^5 dilution (4), which supports the idea that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more effective at replicating.\n\nNow, the key is to determine how much of the recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions or between phages themselves. In the context of phage genetics, this often relates to the disruption of the lysogenic state or the expression of genes necessary for phage replication.\n\nIf there is complete recombination, the two mutations would disrupt the lysogenic expression entirely. If partial recombination occurs, only part of the lysogenic gene would be disrupted, leaving some functional elements. The extent of recombination would affect the fitness of the phages on the host.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula involving the dilution factors and the number of plumes observed. The dilution factor tells us how many copies of the phage are present per well. Higher dilution (smaller number) means fewer phages, so fewer chances for each to infect. Lower dilution (larger number) means more phages, increasing the chance of infection.\n\nThe relationship between recombination frequency (Rf) and the number of plumes can be determined using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (dilution factor)^(-Rf)\n\nAssuming dilution factor D = 10^n, where n is the negative exponent.\n\nIn our case, when the lysogenic phage is present on strain B's lawn, the number of plumes is proportional to (1/D)^{Rf}.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on the observations. For example, when the dilution is 1:10^7 (n=7), the number of plumes is 40, and when the dilution is 1:10^5 (n=5), the number of plumes is 4.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency Rf is consistent across both samples, we can write:\n\n(1/10^7)^{-Rf} / (1/10^5)^{-Rf} = 40 / 4 = 10\n\nSimplify:\n\n(10^7)^{Rf} / (10^5)^{Rf} = 10\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10^{7Rf - 5Rf} = 10^(2Rf) = 10^1\n\nTherefore, 2Rf = 1 \u2192 Rf = 0.5%\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nF. 0.3 percent\n\nG. 0.5 percent\n\nH. 5 percent\n\nI. 0.02 percent\n\nJ. 0.05 percent\n\nK. 0.01 percent\n\nL. 0.005 percent\n\nM. 0.002 percent\n\nN. 0.001 percent\n\nO. 0.0005 percent\n\nP. 0.0002 percent\n\nQ. 0.0001 percent\n\nR. 0.00005 percent\n\nS. 0.00001 percent\n\nT. 0.000005 percent\n\nU. 0.0000005 percent\n\nV. 0.00000005 percent\n\nW. 0.000000005 percent\n\nX. 0.0000000005 percent\n\nY. 0.00000000005 percent\n\nZ. 0.000000000005 percent\n\nBut looking back, the correct answer among the given options is G. 0.5 percent.\n\nWait, but my calculation gave Rf = 0.5%, which corresponds to option G. 0.5 percent.\n\nHowever, the initial assumption might be incorrect.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have more plumes on one lawn, it means fewer infections because higher dilution (lower number of phages per well) would lead to fewer plumes. \n\nWait, no\u2014the way it works is that each plume indicates a single infection event. If you dilute more, you get fewer plumes because each phage has a lower chance of killing the target bacteria. So if you plate a higher dilution (like 1:10^7), you expect fewer plumes. In this case, the first sample was 1:10^7 and had 40 plumes, while the second was 1:10^5 and had 4 plumes. Since the second sample is less diluted, it should show fewer plumes, which matches what happened. That makes sense because the second sample is diluted less, meaning more phages are present, leading to more potential infections. Wait, no\u2014wait, higher dilution means fewer phages, so fewer chances for each to infect. So if you have a higher dilution, you'd see fewer plumes. So the first sample (1:10^7) would have fewer plumes than the second (1:10^5). But in reality, the first had 40, the second had 4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe experiment is about reciprocal selection. They plate a mix of mutantphages on strain B's lawn and then another mix on strain K's lawn. The idea is that certain mutations might cause some phages to be selected against, thus altering the outcome when mixed with others. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B is bad because it doesn't lyse the cells. However, when both types are present, the effect depends on how they interact. If there's recombination, it could mean that the phages somehow influence each other's activity, causing some to die or replicate differently.\n\nWhen they plate on strain B, the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to lytic fission (which kills the host), but the wild-type phage (mutant) might cause lysogeny, allowing replication without death.

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes indicate successful infections on B, and 4 on K. \n\nNow, the key here is to determine how the presence of the lysogenic phage affects the lytic one. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If the two mutations are linked, their combination would cause a new defect. In this case, the lysogenic phage usually causes a different outcome than the lytic one. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might become more effective at replicating without causing lysis, leading to more successful infections. Alternatively, if the mutation in the lysogenic phage is recessive, combining it with another mutation could increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the lysogenic phage is combined with the lytic one, only 40% of the E. coli strain B show successful infection. This suggests that the two mutations interfere with each other. Since the lytic phage typically doesn't affect the lysogenic one, any recombination would reduce the effectiveness. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Observed Frequency / Expected Frequency)\n\nIn this context, the observed frequency is 40%, and the expected frequency under no recombination would be higher. However, since the lysogenic phage is the one causing the issue, perhaps the expectation is when the two don't interact, so maybe the expected is when there's no interference. But wait, actually, when the two phages are on the same DNA molecule, their effects can interfere. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces its replication efficiency, then combining it with the lytic phage (which doesn't replicate efficiently) might lead to less overall replication success.\n\nBut another approach is to think about the likelihood ratio. If recombination occurs, the probability that a phage will successfully infect a bacterium decreases. So, the number of successful infections would decrease compared to what you'd expect if there was no recombination.\n\nLet's denote:\n- S as the number of successful infections.\n- N as the total number of bacteria plated.\n- P as the probability of recombination.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the probability of infection would decrease by a factor of P. So, the observed S is related to the expected S without recombination.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all E. coli would be effectively killed by the lysogenic phage. But with recombination, some survive. So, let's say without recombination, the lysogenic phage kills all E. coli, but with recombination, some survive.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage without recombination typically doesn't kill the E. coli. But when it combines with another mutation, like the lytic one, it becomes more efficient, leading to fewer infections.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the number of plumes. If recombination occurred, the number of successful infections would depend on the chance that the two mutations combine. The formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant offspring / Total offspring)\n\nHere, the \"number of recombinant offspring\" would correspond to the number of times both mutations occurred together, reducing the effect. But in this case, the presence of both mutations leads to less successful infections. So, the number of recombinants (both mutations) would be the number of successes where both happened. But in our data, it's more complicated because the lysogenic phage alone causes issues, but when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of successful infections.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the probabilities. Let\u2019s assume that the lysogenic phage normally has a certain rate of killing E. coli. When combined with the lytic phage, their combined effect is reduced. Suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all E. coli (100%), but with recombination, it only causes a certain percentage of death.\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage causes issues, and when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of infections. So, maybe the presence of the lytic phage increases the chance that the lysogenic phage cannot fully replicate, leading to more deaths.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is the one causing the problem, and the lytic phage is neutral or harmful. When combined, the number of successful infections is lower, indicating that the two mutations interact.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability of recombination affecting the lysogenic phage's activity. If the two mutations are linked, then the probability that a phage carrying both mutations will replicate without replicating (if it's lysogenic) or without lysis (if it's lytic).\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to look at the ratio of successful infections. Normally, if there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should kill all E. coli. But with recombination, it only partially kills them, leading to some survivors.\n\nGiven that 40% of E. coli on B survived, and 4 on K survived, we can infer that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused a reduction in survival. Now, K is the strain where the lysogenic phage isn't present; it's a different strain. So, when the lysogenic phage is combined with the lytic, K's E. coli may benefit from the lysogenic phage's mutation.\n\nSo, the number of successful infections on K (4) indicates that the lysogenic phage worked well there, while on B (40), it didn't work as well. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is associated with a higher chance of being recognized by the phage on K, meaning that the two mutations are linked because they function together in silico.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- F as the recombination frequency.\n- The expected number of successful infections on B without recombination would be 100% (since the lysogenic phage shouldn\u2019t kill B anyway).\n- With recombination, the number is 40%.\n\nSo, the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40%. Therefore, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = 1 - (Percentage of recombinant / Percentage of non-recombinant + 1)\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe another way: if recombination occurs, the chance of infection is reduced. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all E. coli (so 0% survival). With recombination, it only causes a certain level of survival.\n\nBut according to the data, on B, only 40% survived. On K, 4 survived. So, the difference is significant. It suggests that the two mutations are linked because the presence of both leads to a reduction in survival.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, let\u2019s use the formula:\n\nF = 1 - (Frequency of recombinant / Frequency of total)\n\nWhere frequency of total includes both recombinant and non-recombinant. However, in this case, the presence of the lysogenic phage (which carries a mutation) leads to a failure in replication. So, the frequency of successful infections is 40% on B and 4% on K.\n\nWait, that might not directly translate. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the expected number of successful infections without recombination versus with recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the lysogenic phage would have 100% survival. With recombination, it has a lower survival rate. The observed survival rates suggest that the recombination frequency is high.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Observed Frequency / Expected Frequency)\n\nBut the expected frequency without recombination would be 100%, and with recombination, it's 40% on B. So,\n\nF = 1 - (40% / 100%) ) = 60%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if recombination increased the survival, the formula wouldn't apply correctly. Perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the recombination frequency can be determined by looking at the ratio of the number of recombinants to the total number of mutations. Alternatively, using the Poisson approximation for recombination frequencies.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the number of successful infections depends on the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If the two mutations are linked, the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.\n\nBut given that the data shows that when both mutations occur together, the number of successful infections is significantly lower than when only one mutation occurs, we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency when dealing with two linked alleles is:\n\nF = 1 - (p * q)\n\nwhere p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. However, in this case, the mutations are on the same DNA molecule, so the concept applies differently.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the ratio of the number of recombinants to the total number of mutations. But in this case, the number of recombinant events (both mutations) would be the number of plumes where both mutations occurred, leading to fewer infections.\n\nHowever, in our data, we're only seeing the combined effect on B. On K, only the lysogenic phage mutation is present, so the number of plumes reflects the expected behavior when the lysogenic phage is alone.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's easier to recall that when two mutations are linked, the number of recombinants (both mutations) will be less frequent than expected. In this case, on B, the lysogenic phage causes issues, and when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of infections. On K, only the lysogenic phage is present, so the lytic phage (which is not present on K) doesn't affect it.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage on B leads to a higher number of recombinants (both mutations) than on K, which makes sense because K lacks the lytic phage.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of the number of recombinants to the total number of possible combinations. But since we're dealing with independent mutations, the formula would involve the square root of the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, without knowing the exact frequencies of each mutation, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the number of successful infections is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. If the two mutations are linked, the occurrence of both mutations together is less likely than expected, leading to fewer successful infections.\n\nGiven that on B, 40% of E. coli survive, and on K, 4% survive, the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40% / 60% = 2/3. Therefore, the recombination frequency is approximately 2/3, which is about 66.67%. But none of the options match that. The closest option is D (0.05%), which is much lower. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of successful infections is inversely related to the probability of recombination. If recombination occurs, the number of successful infections decreases exponentially.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p = probability of recombination\n- q = probability of no recombination\n\nThen, the expected number of successful infections on B would be q * 100%, plus p * r * 100%, where r is the number of recombinants per unit. But without specific values, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, since on B, 40% survived, and on K, 4% survived, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the presence of both mutations causes a tenfold reduction in survival compared to either mutation alone. If the two mutations are completely linked, the survival would be equal to the frequency of either mutation. But in reality, the survival is lower because of the combination.\n\nPerhaps the formula for the number of recombinants is:\n\nR = p * q * N\n\nWhere R is the number of recombinants, p is the probability of recombination, q is the probability of non-recombination, and N is the number of individuals.\n\nBut in our case, without knowing p or q, it's hard to compute. However, we can approximate that the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40% / 60% = 2/3. Therefore, the recombination frequency is around 2/3, which is approximately 66.67%. But again, this isn't among the answer choices.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: the highest is G (0.5%) and others go down to E (0.02%). None of these are close to 66.67%. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is the reciprocal of the ratio. Since 40% survived on B and 4% on K, the ratio is 10:1. So the recombination frequency is ln(10)/ln(2) \u2248 3.32, which is about 33.2%, still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: when two mutations are linked, the probability that a phage carrying both mutations will infect a bacterium is less than if it carries only one mutation. Given that the lysogenic phage alone causes problems, and when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of infections, we can estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of successful infections when both mutations are present is:\n\nExpected = 100% * (1 - p)^2\n\nWhere p is the probability of each mutation. But without knowing p, this is unhelpful.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of the number of recombinants to the total number of mutations, the recombination frequency can be approximated by:\n\nF = 1 - (Number of recombinants / Number of total mutations)\n\nBut again, without counts, this is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation uses the number of recombinants (both mutations) and the non-recombinants (either mutation). The observed numbers are 40% on B and 4% on K. Assuming that on K, only the lysogenic mutation is present, so the lytic phage isn't a factor. Therefore, the 4% survival on K corresponds to the expected survival when only the lysogenic phage is present, which would be 100% if the mutation wasn't causing issues. But since it's causing issues, the actual survival is 4%, meaning that the presence of the lysogenic phage is making it resistant. So, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that the lysogenic phage now has a lower chance of surviving.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Maybe it's time to think of it in terms of the possible answers. The options are very low except for D (0.05%) and A (1%). Since the presence of both mutations reduces the number of survivors, the recombination frequency must be high enough to explain this.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 0.05%, that means the chance that a phage carries both mutations is very low. Then, the expected number of survivors would be 100% * (1 - 0.05%)^2 \u2248 99.9%. But in our case, on B, 40% survived, which is way lower than 100%. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be much higher, like 0.05% implies 99.9% survival, but we see 40% survival. That's a big discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the expected to observed. Or maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, another idea: the number of recombinants (both mutations) divided by the total number of mutations equals the recombination frequency. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's impossible. However, in this case, the presence of the lysogenic phage on B leads to a higher proportion of recombinants than on K. Since K lacks the lytic phage, the lysogenic mutation alone causes issues, whereas on B, the combination also causes issues but less severely.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say 2%, then the number of recombinants would be higher. Let's test this.\n\nSuppose F = 2% (option C). Then, the expected number of recombinants would be 2% of the population. So, on B, 40% survival would include both recombinants and non-recombinants. Similarly, on K, 4% survival would only include non-recombinants. But without knowing the total population, it's hard to relate.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40% / 60% = 2/3. If the recombination frequency is F, then the ratio would be F / (1 - F). Setting F/(1-F) = 2/3, solving gives F=2/5=0.4, which is 40%. But 40% isn't an option. Closest is C (1.5%) or D (0.05%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to take the geometric mean of the ratios. For B: 40%, K:4%. Geometric mean is sqrt(40*4)=sqrt(160)=~12.6%. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe it's just the ratio of the two. 40/4=10. Taking log base e, ln(10)=2.3026. Dividing by 2 (since two processes): ~1.15%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum: 40+4=44%. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Looking back, the correct answer is probably D (0.05%) or E (0.2%). Given that the number of recombinants is 40% on B and 4% on K, the ratio is 10:1. To get a ratio of 10:1, the recombination frequency would be roughly 0.02 or 0.05. Option E is 0.2%, which is 0.2/100=0.002. Using the formula F = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q), but without knowing p and q, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of recombinants on B is 40% and on K is 4%, the ratio is 10:1. If the recombination frequency is x, then the expected number of recombinants on B would be x*(1-x)*N, and similarly on K. But without N, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, corresponding to option E. Because 40% survival suggests a high recombination frequency, but the options don't have 10",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes indicate successful infections on B, and 4 on K. \n\nNow, the key here is to determine how the presence of the lysogenic phage affects the lytic one. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If the two mutations are linked, their combination would cause a new defect. In this case, the lysogenic phage usually causes a different outcome than the lytic one. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might become more effective at replicating without causing lysis, leading to more successful infections. Alternatively, if the mutation in the lysogenic phage is recessive, combining it with another mutation could increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the lysogenic phage is combined with the lytic one, only 40% of the E. coli strain B show successful infection. This suggests that the two mutations interfere with each other. Since the lytic phage typically doesn't affect the lysogenic one, any recombination would reduce the effectiveness. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Observed Frequency / Expected Frequency)\n\nIn this context, the observed frequency is 40%, and the expected frequency under no recombination would be higher. However, since the lysogenic phage is the one causing the issue, perhaps the expectation is when the two don't interact, so maybe the expected is when there's no interference. But wait, actually, when the two phages are on the same DNA molecule, their effects can interfere. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces its replication efficiency, then combining it with the lytic phage (which doesn't replicate efficiently) might lead to less overall replication success.\n\nBut another approach is to think about the likelihood ratio. If recombination occurs, the probability that a phage will successfully infect a bacterium decreases. So, the number of successful infections would decrease compared to what you'd expect if there was no recombination.\n\nLet's denote:\n- S as the number of successful infections.\n- N as the total number of bacteria plated.\n- P as the probability of recombination.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the probability of infection would decrease by a factor of P. So, the observed S is related to the expected S without recombination.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, all E. coli would be effectively killed by the lysogenic phage. But with recombination, some survive. So, let's say without recombination, the lysogenic phage kills all E. coli, but with recombination, some survive.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage without recombination typically doesn't kill the E. coli. But when it combines with another mutation, like the lytic one, it becomes more efficient, leading to fewer infections.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the number of plumes. If recombination occurred, the number of successful infections would depend on the chance that the two mutations combine. The formula for recombination frequency is often expressed as:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant offspring / Total offspring)\n\nHere, the \"number of recombinant offspring\" would correspond to the number of times both mutations occurred together, reducing the effect. But in this case, the presence of both mutations leads to less successful infections. So, the number of recombinants (both mutations) would be the number of successes where both happened. But in our data, it's more complicated because the lysogenic phage alone causes issues, but when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of successful infections.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the probabilities. Let\u2019s assume that the lysogenic phage normally has a certain rate of killing E. coli. When combined with the lytic phage, their combined effect is reduced. Suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all E. coli (100%), but with recombination, it only causes a certain percentage of death.\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage causes issues, and when combined with the lytic, it reduces the number of infections. So, maybe the presence of the lytic phage increases the chance that the lysogenic phage cannot fully replicate, leading to more deaths.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is the one causing the problem, and the lytic phage is neutral or harmful. When combined, the number of successful infections is lower, indicating that the two mutations interact.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability of recombination affecting the lysogenic phage's activity. If the two mutations are linked, then the probability that a phage carrying both mutations will replicate without replicating (if it's lysogenic) or without lysis (if it's lytic).\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to look at the ratio of successful infections. Normally, if there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should kill all E. coli. But with recombination, it only partially kills them, leading to some survivors.\n\nGiven that 40% of E. coli on B survived, and 4 on K survived, we can infer that the presence of the lysogenic phage caused a reduction in survival. Now, K is the strain where the lysogenic phage isn't present; it's a different strain. So, when the lysogenic phage is combined with the lytic, K's E. coli may benefit from the lysogenic phage's mutation.\n\nSo, the number of successful infections on K (4) indicates that the lysogenic phage worked well there, while on B (40), it didn't work as well. This suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is associated with a higher chance of being recognized by the phage on K, meaning that the two mutations are linked because they function together in silico.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- F as the recombination frequency.\n- The expected number of successful infections on B without recombination would be 100% (since the lysogenic phage shouldn\u2019t kill B anyway).\n- With recombination, the number is 40%.\n\nSo, the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40%. Therefore, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = 1 - (Percentage of recombinant / Percentage of non-recombinant + 1)\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe another way: if recombination occurs, the chance of infection is reduced. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all E. coli (so 0% survival). With recombination, it only causes a certain level of survival.\n\nBut according to the data, on B, only 40% survived. On K, 4 survived. So, the difference is significant. It suggests that the two mutations are linked because the presence of both leads to a reduction in survival.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, let\u2019s use the formula:\n\nF = 1 - (Frequency of recombinant / Frequency of total)\n\nWhere frequency of total includes both recombinant and non-recombinant.

So, the frequency of successful infections is 40% on B and 4% on K.\n\nWait, that might not directly translate.

With recombination, it has a lower survival rate. The observed survival rates suggest that the recombination frequency is high.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Observed Frequency / Expected Frequency)\n\nBut the expected frequency without recombination would be 100%, and with recombination, it's 40% on B. So,\n\nF = 1 - (40% / 100%) ) = 60%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if recombination increased the survival, the formula wouldn't apply correctly. Perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the recombination frequency can be determined by looking at the ratio of the number of recombinants to the total number of mutations. Alternatively, using the Poisson approximation for recombination frequencies.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the number of successful infections depends on the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.

Similarly, on K, 4% survival would only include non-recombinants. But without knowing the total population, it's hard to relate.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant is 40% / 60% = 2/3. If the recombination frequency is F, then the ratio would be F / (1 - F). Setting F/(1-F) = 2/3, solving gives F=2/5=0.4, which is 40%. But 40% isn't an option. Closest is C (1.5%) or D (0.05%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to take the geometric mean of the ratios. For B: 40%, K:4%. Geometric mean is sqrt(40*4)=sqrt(160)=~12.6%. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe it's just the ratio of the two. 40/4=10. Taking log base e, ln(10)=2.3026. Dividing by 2 (since two processes): ~1.15%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum: 40+4=44%. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Looking back, the correct answer is probably D (0.05%) or E (0.2%). Given that the number of recombinants is 40% on B and 4% on K, the ratio is 10:1. To get a ratio of 10:1, the recombination frequency would be roughly 0.02 or 0.05. Option E is 0.2%, which is 0.2/100=0.002. Using the formula F = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q), but without knowing p and q, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of recombinants on B is 40% and on K is 4%, the ratio is 10:1. If the recombination frequency is x, then the expected number of recombinants on B would be x*(1-x)*N, and similarly on K. But without N, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, corresponding to option E. Because 40% survival suggests a high recombination frequency, but the options don't have 10",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So if you have four plumes on strain K, that means four successful infections, right?",
    "rollout": " So if you have four plumes on strain K, that means four successful infections, right? And 40 on strain B would be 40 infections on B's lawn.\n\nNow, I remember that in recombinant DNA experiments, especially in phage genetics, the number of recombinants depends on how much of each mutation was present. If you have two mutations that recombine, their occurrence can influence the number of recombined products. In phages, when you plate them on another phage's lawn, the number of times the phages infect each other indicates recombination. The formula for calculating the percentage recombination is often based on the ratio of the two doses used during the screening.\n\nThe standard approach uses two different dilutions: one at a higher dilution rate (higher concentration) and one at a lower dilution. The number of offspring observed from each treatment is then compared to determine the efficiency of recombination. The efficiency (or yield) is calculated as the number of recombinant offspring divided by the total number of offspring expected. This efficiency is then converted into a percentage representing the fraction of recombining events.\n\nIn this case, one half is plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively. The result was 4 on K and 40 on B. Hmm, wait\u2014plated on strain K would mean those are being tested against strain B's lawn? Or maybe it's about whether the phage can enter the E. coli. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of recombinant fusions. \n\nWait, let me think again. If both strains are E. coli, and the phage is testing for its ability to integrate into the host genome. The presence of multiple plasmids could indicate recombination. The key here is the difference in counts between the two plating batches. On strain K, there were more plumes (40) than on strain B (4). That seems contradictory unless... Wait, no, actually, that might not make sense because strain K is the target in the second plate. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of successful infections on each strain. So 40 successful infections on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's lawn. Since both are being tested against each other's plasmid integrations, the ratio should reflect the likelihood of recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the formula for calculating the efficiency of cross-antibody tests. It's generally done by measuring the ratio of recombinant colonies to non-recombinant ones. The formula is (R1 / R2), where R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first test plate, and R2 is the sum of recombinant and non-recombinant colonies on the second plate. Then, the efficiency is taken as (R1 * 100)/(R1 + R2).\n\nBut in this case, both plates are using the same phage type, just different targets. Strain B's lawn is treated with the phage, and strain K's lawn is also treated with the same phage. So perhaps the number of plasmids per phage corresponds to the degree of integration.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to consider that when you plate both strains, the number of successful infections on each gives an indication of the effectiveness of the cross-reactivity. However, since we're dealing with two different target phages, the actual measure might relate to the efficiency of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids or the degree of integration can be determined by comparing the number of successful infections. If the two treatments have different efficiencies, that suggests a certain level of recombination.\n\nLet me try to apply the formula. Suppose R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first plate (strain B's lawn), and R2 is the number on the second plate (strain K's lawn). Then, the efficiency (e) is e = (R1 * 100)/(R1 + R2). Plugging in R1=40 and R2=4, e=(40*100)/(40+4)=4000/44\u224890.9%. Wait, that's very high, which doesn't fit any of the options provided. So maybe I got the numbers wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up which is R1 and R2. Let me clarify. Typically, R1 is the recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the sum of both recombinant and non-recombinant on the second plate. So if R1=40 and R2=44 (40+4), then e=40/(40+4)*100\u224888.8%, still too high.\n\nHmm, maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination efficiency can be estimated by the ratio of the number of recombinant plasmids in the two strains. For example, if you have x recombining plasmids in strain B and y in strain K, then the efficiency is (x/y) *100%.\n\nBut without knowing x and y, this approach might not work. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids per phage can be used. Each phage has a certain number of plasmids integrated into the host genome. The more plasmids, the less likely the phage integrates.\n\nWait, another thought: in the absence of recombination, all plasmids would integrate equally. With recombination, the integration rates differ. So the number of plasmids in strain B vs. strain K would give an idea of the recombination efficiency.\n\nIf the numbers of plasmids are proportional to the square root of the number of plasmids per phage, then the efficiency can be calculated. But without specific data on plasmid counts, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids detected per gram is a better indicator. But again, without specifics, this is difficult.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So the first half was treated on strain B's lawn, and the second on strain K's. On strain B's lawn, 4 plumes appeared, meaning 4 successful infections. On strain K's lawn, 40 plumes appeared, meaning 40 successful infections. The total number of phages plated on each lawn would be the dilution factor multiplied by the number of plasmids per phage. Assuming each phage carries N plasmids, then the number of plasmids in each sample would be (1/10^5)*N and (1/10^7)*N for the two samples.\n\nWait, but the number of plasmids detected on the lawn relates to the efficiency of integration. If the phage successfully integrated into the host genome, it would replicate and cause the plasmid to be present in the sample. The number of plasmids detected on the lawn is proportional to the efficiency of integration.\n\nSo if the number of plasmids on strain B's lawn is 4 and on strain K's is 40, the ratio of plasmids per gram is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That suggests that the phage integrated into 1/10th the plasmids on strain K's lawn compared to strain B's. This implies a high degree of recombination, as the phage integrated into fewer plasmids on strain K's lawn, suggesting that most of the plasmids were recombined.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage recombination = [(Efficiency)^2] *100%\n\nWhere Efficiency is the ratio of plasmids per gram on the two samples.\n\nHere, Efficiency = 40/4 = 10. So,\n\nPercentage recombination = (10^2)*100% = 10000% \u2192 That's way too high. Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio of plasmids is related to the fraction of the phage's genome that was integrated. If the phage integrated 1/10th of the plasmids on strain K's lawn, then the recombination efficiency is approximately (1 - (1/10)) *100% \u2248 90%. But none of the answer choices match this either.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for percentage recombination in phage genetics is sometimes given by:\n\nPercentage recombination = (Number of recombinant colonies \u00d7 100) / (Total number of colonies)\n\nBut in this case, if we have 40 colonies on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's, assuming that the recombination occurred in such a way that 40/4 = 10 times more on strain K's lawn, indicating that the phage integrated 1/10 of the plasmids on strain K's side. Thus, the recombination efficiency would be 1 - (1/10) = 0.9 or 90%, which again is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. If 40 plumes are found on strain K's lawn, that might mean 40 successful infections, while 4 on strain B's lawn. Since strain K is the target, perhaps these are the number of successful integrations. Therefore, the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. That suggests that the phage integrated 1/10 of the plasmids on strain K's side compared to strain B's. So the efficiency would be (10 - 1)/10 = 0.9, or 90%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of recombined plasmids. So if there are 40 on strain K and 4 on B, the difference is 36. That suggests 36 recombined plasmids. To find the percentage, we'd need to know the total possible, but without that, it's hard.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of plasmids per phage. Let\u2019s assume each phage has N plasmids. On strain B's lawn, 4 plumes were detected, meaning 4 phages had integrated into the genome, so N_B = 4. On strain K's lawn, 40 plumes were detected, so N_K = 40. The recombination efficiency would then be (N_K - N_B)/N_K *100% = (40-4)/40 *100% = 36/40 *100% = 90%. Again, not matching any option.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is G. 0.5 percent, but that's way too low. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the numbers represent the number of successful invasions rather than plasmids. If 40 were successful on K and 4 on B, maybe the recombination efficiency is 40/4 = 10 times more effective on K. So, if the baseline is 10%, then K's success is 100%, giving a 90% efficiency. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nEfficiency = (Number of recombinant colonies / Total number of colonies) \u00d7 100%\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant colonies is the difference between the two samples. Here, 40 - 4 = 36. So,\n\nEfficiency = (36 / (40 + 4)) \u00d7 100% = (36/44)\u00d7100% \u2248 81.8%. Still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the plasmids per gram, so the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. So the recombination efficiency would be 1 - (4/40) = 0.8, or 80%. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the answer choices. They are all percentages like 0.05%, 0.1%, etc., which are tiny fractions. If the efficiency was 0.05%, that would correspond to a small number of recombined plasmids. How?\n\nSuppose the formula is:\n\nRecombination Fraction = (R1 / (R1 + R2)) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the number on the second plate plus the non-recombinant on the first plate. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAnother angle: in recombinant DNA experiments, the efficiency is often expressed as the percentage of successfully integrated phages. If 40 are successful on K and 4 on B, perhaps the efficiency is 40/(40 + 4) = 88.8%, which is not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of plasmids per phage determines the efficiency. If you plate two different concentrations, the efficiency of cross-reactivity increases. The formula for efficiency is usually:\n\nEfficiency = (R1 \u00d7 100) / (R1 + R2)\n\nWhere R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the total number on the second plate (recombinant plus non-recombinant). Here, R1=40, R2=44. So,\n\nEfficiency = (40 \u00d7 100) / 44 \u2248 90.9%. But again, this is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nEfficiency = ((R1 / R2) \u00d7 100)\n\nWith R1=40, R2=4, so 40/4=10, which is 1000%, which is impossible. So this approach must be incorrect.\n\nMaybe the problem is simpler. If you have two different dilutions, the number of plasmids per phage affects the likelihood of integrating into the target. If 40 are on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1, implying that the phage integrated into 1/10th the plasmids on K's side, leading to high recombination efficiency.\n\nBut none of the options reach that. The highest is F. 0.3 percent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is based on the number of plasmids per phage. If each phage has a certain number of plasmids, say N. On strain B's lawn, 4 plasmids were detected, meaning N_B=4. On strain K's lawn, 40 plasmids were detected, meaning N_K=40. The recombination efficiency would be (N_K - N_B)/N_K *100% = (40-4)/40 *100% = 90%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of recombinant phages across both plating batches. If 40 are successful on K and 4 on B, the total is 44. The number of recombinants on K is 40, so (40/44)*100% \u2248 90.9%. No, that's still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nPercentage recombination = (Number of recombinant plasmids / Total plasmids) \u00d7100%\n\nIf the total plasmids on strain K's lawn are 40 and on B's are 4, then the difference is 36. So,\n\n(36 / 40) \u00d7100% = 90%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should refer back to the initial problem statement. It says that the two mutants are causing the lytic fission in E. coli strain B but not in strain K. Wait, that makes sense because the lysogenic phage (mutant B) would lyse the cells, whereas the other phage (mutant K) would not. So the presence of lysogenic phage mutants in strain B explains the lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage mutants in strain K explain why the E. coli didn't lyse.\n\nWhen the two types are present together, the E. coli in strain B show a higher proportion of lysogenic phages, but in reality, the lysogenic phage mutants only exist in strain B. Wait, no\u2014the question states that the two mutant phages are present simultaneously. So when both are present, only the lysogenic phage (mutant B) will lyse E. coli strain B, while the lysogenic phage (mutant K) won't affect strain B because strain B doesn't have lysogenic phages. Wait, that doesn't make sense because strain B would already contain lysogenic phages if they are present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The two mutant phages are present in the same population. So when placed on strain B, only the lysogenic phage (mutant B) would lyse, causing the E. coli to lyse. Similarly, when placed on strain K, only the lysogenic phage (mutant K) would lyse, but since strain K doesn't have lysogenic phages, it wouldn't lyse, resulting in fewer plasmids detected.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli on strain B shows half the plasmids (due to the double selection?), and on strain K, only 4 are found. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment measures the number of successful invasions. If 40 on strain K and 4 on strain B, the difference is 36. The recombination efficiency would be 36/40=90%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the recombination events that occurred, based on the number of plasmids detected. If strain B has 4 plasmids and strain K has 40, the recombination happened 40-4=36 times. So the efficiency is 36/40=90%, but that's not an option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation. Maybe the ratio of plasmids detected is used to estimate the efficiency. For example, if you have X plasmids on one strain and Y on the other, the efficiency is Y/X -1. So 40/4=10, minus 1 is 9. So 90%, but again, not matching options.\n\nAlternatively, if the efficiency is calculated as (X-Y)/X, it's (40-4)/40=0.8, or 80%, which is still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (Y/(X+Y)) *100.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have four plumes on strain K, that means four successful infections, right? And 40 on strain B would be 40 infections on B's lawn.\n\nNow, I remember that in recombinant DNA experiments, especially in phage genetics, the number of recombinants depends on how much of each mutation was present. If you have two mutations that recombine, their occurrence can influence the number of recombined products. In phages, when you plate them on another phage's lawn, the number of times the phages infect each other indicates recombination. The formula for calculating the percentage recombination is often based on the ratio of the two doses used during the screening.\n\nThe standard approach uses two different dilutions: one at a higher dilution rate (higher concentration) and one at a lower dilution. The number of offspring observed from each treatment is then compared to determine the efficiency of recombination. The efficiency (or yield) is calculated as the number of recombinant offspring divided by the total number of offspring expected. This efficiency is then converted into a percentage representing the fraction of recombining events.\n\nIn this case, one half is plated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5 respectively. The result was 4 on K and 40 on B. Hmm, wait\u2014plated on strain K would mean those are being tested against strain B's lawn?

If both strains are E. coli, and the phage is testing for its ability to integrate into the host genome. The presence of multiple plasmids could indicate recombination. The key here is the difference in counts between the two plating batches. On strain K, there were more plumes (40) than on strain B (4). That seems contradictory unless... Wait, no, actually, that might not make sense because strain K is the target in the second plate. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of successful infections on each strain. So 40 successful infections on strain B's lawn and 4 on strain K's lawn. Since both are being tested against each other's plasmid integrations, the ratio should reflect the likelihood of recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the formula for calculating the efficiency of cross-antibody tests. It's generally done by measuring the ratio of recombinant colonies to non-recombinant ones. The formula is (R1 / R2), where R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first test plate, and R2 is the sum of recombinant and non-recombinant colonies on the second plate. Then, the efficiency is taken as (R1 * 100)/(R1 + R2).\n\nBut in this case, both plates are using the same phage type, just different targets. Strain B's lawn is treated with the phage, and strain K's lawn is also treated with the same phage. So perhaps the number of plasmids per phage corresponds to the degree of integration.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to consider that when you plate both strains, the number of successful infections on each gives an indication of the effectiveness of the cross-reactivity. However, since we're dealing with two different target phages, the actual measure might relate to the efficiency of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids or the degree of integration can be determined by comparing the number of successful infections.

Typically, R1 is the recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the sum of both recombinant and non-recombinant on the second plate. So if R1=40 and R2=44 (40+4), then e=40/(40+4)*100\u224888.8%, still too high.\n\nHmm, maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination efficiency can be estimated by the ratio of the number of recombinant plasmids in the two strains. For example, if you have x recombining plasmids in strain B and y in strain K, then the efficiency is (x/y) *100%.\n\nBut without knowing x and y, this approach might not work.

On strain B's lawn, 4 plumes appeared, meaning 4 successful infections. On strain K's lawn, 40 plumes appeared, meaning 40 successful infections. The total number of phages plated on each lawn would be the dilution factor multiplied by the number of plasmids per phage. Assuming each phage carries N plasmids, then the number of plasmids in each sample would be (1/10^5)*N and (1/10^7)*N for the two samples.\n\nWait, but the number of plasmids detected on the lawn relates to the efficiency of integration. If the phage successfully integrated into the host genome, it would replicate and cause the plasmid to be present in the sample. The number of plasmids detected on the lawn is proportional to the efficiency of integration.\n\nSo if the number of plasmids on strain B's lawn is 4 and on strain K's is 40, the ratio of plasmids per gram is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That suggests that the phage integrated into 1/10th the plasmids on strain K's lawn compared to strain B's. This implies a high degree of recombination, as the phage integrated into fewer plasmids on strain K's lawn, suggesting that most of the plasmids were recombined.\n\nTo calculate the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage recombination = [(Efficiency)^2] *100%\n\nWhere Efficiency is the ratio of plasmids per gram on the two samples.\n\nHere, Efficiency = 40/4 = 10.

Clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the ratio of plasmids is related to the fraction of the phage's genome that was integrated. If the phage integrated 1/10th of the plasmids on strain K's lawn, then the recombination efficiency is approximately (1 - (1/10)) *100% \u2248 90%.

Thus, the recombination efficiency would be 1 - (1/10) = 0.9 or 90%, which again is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. If 40 plumes are found on strain K's lawn, that might mean 40 successful infections, while 4 on strain B's lawn. Since strain K is the target, perhaps these are the number of successful integrations. Therefore, the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. That suggests that the phage integrated 1/10 of the plasmids on strain K's side compared to strain B's. So the efficiency would be (10 - 1)/10 = 0.9, or 90%. Still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of recombined plasmids. So if there are 40 on strain K and 4 on B, the difference is 36. That suggests 36 recombined plasmids.

Perhaps the numbers represent the number of successful invasions rather than plasmids. If 40 were successful on K and 4 on B, maybe the recombination efficiency is 40/4 = 10 times more effective on K. So, if the baseline is 10%, then K's success is 100%, giving a 90% efficiency. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nEfficiency = (Number of recombinant colonies / Total number of colonies) \u00d7 100%\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant colonies is the difference between the two samples. Here, 40 - 4 = 36. So,\n\nEfficiency = (36 / (40 + 4)) \u00d7 100% = (36/44)\u00d7100% \u2248 81.8%. Still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the plasmids per gram, so the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1. So the recombination efficiency would be 1 - (4/40) = 0.8, or 80%. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the answer choices. They are all percentages like 0.05%, 0.1%, etc., which are tiny fractions. If the efficiency was 0.05%, that would correspond to a small number of recombined plasmids. How?\n\nSuppose the formula is:\n\nRecombination Fraction = (R1 / (R1 + R2)) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the number on the second plate plus the non-recombinant on the first plate. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAnother angle: in recombinant DNA experiments, the efficiency is often expressed as the percentage of successfully integrated phages. If 40 are successful on K and 4 on B, perhaps the efficiency is 40/(40 + 4) = 88.8%, which is not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of plasmids per phage determines the efficiency. If you plate two different concentrations, the efficiency of cross-reactivity increases. The formula for efficiency is usually:\n\nEfficiency = (R1 \u00d7 100) / (R1 + R2)\n\nWhere R1 is the number of recombinant colonies on the first plate, and R2 is the total number on the second plate (recombinant plus non-recombinant). Here, R1=40, R2=44. So,\n\nEfficiency = (40 \u00d7 100) / 44 \u2248 90.9%. But again, this is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nEfficiency = ((R1 / R2) \u00d7 100)\n\nWith R1=40, R2=4, so 40/4=10, which is 1000%, which is impossible. So this approach must be incorrect.\n\nMaybe the problem is simpler. If you have two different dilutions, the number of plasmids per phage affects the likelihood of integrating into the target. If 40 are on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1, implying that the phage integrated into 1/10th the plasmids on K's side, leading to high recombination efficiency.\n\nBut none of the options reach that. The highest is F. 0.3 percent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is based on the number of plasmids per phage. If each phage has a certain number of plasmids, say N. On strain B's lawn, 4 plasmids were detected, meaning N_B=4. On strain K's lawn, 40 plasmids were detected, meaning N_K=40. The recombination efficiency would be (N_K - N_B)/N_K *100% = (40-4)/40 *100% = 90%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of recombinant phages across both plating batches. If 40 are successful on K and 4 on B, the total is 44. The number of recombinants on K is 40, so (40/44)*100% \u2248 90.9%. No, that's still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nPercentage recombination = (Number of recombinant plasmids / Total plasmids) \u00d7100%\n\nIf the total plasmids on strain K's lawn are 40 and on B's are 4, then the difference is 36. So,\n\n(36 / 40) \u00d7100% = 90%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should refer back to the initial problem statement. It says that the two mutants are causing the lytic fission in E. coli strain B but not in strain K. Wait, that makes sense because the lysogenic phage (mutant B) would lyse the cells, whereas the other phage (mutant K) would not. So the presence of lysogenic phage mutants in strain B explains the lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage mutants in strain K explain why the E. coli didn't lyse.\n\nWhen the two types are present together, the E. coli in strain B show a higher proportion of lysogenic phages, but in reality, the lysogenic phage mutants only exist in strain B. Wait, no\u2014the question states that the two mutant phages are present simultaneously. So when both are present, only the lysogenic phage (mutant B) will lyse E. coli strain B, while the lysogenic phage (mutant K) won't affect strain B because strain B doesn't have lysogenic phages. Wait, that doesn't make sense because strain B would already contain lysogenic phages if they are present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The two mutant phages are present in the same population. So when placed on strain B, only the lysogenic phage (mutant B) would lyse, causing the E. coli to lyse. Similarly, when placed on strain K, only the lysogenic phage (mutant K) would lyse, but since strain K doesn't have lysogenic phages, it wouldn't lyse, resulting in fewer plasmids detected.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli on strain B shows half the plasmids (due to the double selection?), and on strain K, only 4 are found. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment measures the number of successful invasions. If 40 on strain K and 4 on strain B, the difference is 36. The recombination efficiency would be 36/40=90%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the recombination events that occurred, based on the number of plasmids detected. If strain B has 4 plasmids and strain K has 40, the recombination happened 40-4=36 times. So the efficiency is 36/40=90%, but that's not an option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation. Maybe the ratio of plasmids detected is used to estimate the efficiency. For example, if you have X plasmids on one strain and Y on the other, the efficiency is Y/X -1. So 40/4=10, minus 1 is 9. So 90%, but again, not matching options.\n\nAlternatively, if the efficiency is calculated as (X-Y)/X, it's (40-4)/40=0.8, or 80%, which is still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (Y/(X+Y)) *100. So 4",

Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If the two mutations are in different genes, their combination would affect the outcome. In phages, if two mutants have different resistance genes (like RII), combining them might lead to a new type of resistance that isn't seen individually. This could cause some cells to be resistant to one mutation but not another, depending on where the mutations occur.\n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombinant offspring in a dihybrid cross is:\n\nPercentage = [(number of recombinant individuals + number of parental non-recombinants)] / [total number of individuals]\n\nBut wait, in phage experiments, sometimes the concept of interference is used, but maybe a simpler approach applies here. Alternatively, the idea is that if there's recombination, the probability of an individual carrying both mutated genes is lower than expected without recombination.\n\nIn the given case, let's consider the number of cells that were lysed. Normally, if there was no recombination, you'd expect about 50% of the cells to be lysed. However, due to recombination, the actual distribution depends on whether the two mutations are in different genes. Since the problem states that the lysing effect occurs only in the presence of lysogenic phages, and the other type doesn't, perhaps the recombination affects the effectiveness of lysogenic phages.\n\nWait, the initial condition says that only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission in strain B. So if the two mutations are in the same gene, then all lysogenic phages would behave the same way, leading to either full lysing or none. But since only lysogenic phages cause issues, it implies that the two mutations are in different genes, meaning recombination has happened between them.\n\nSo, the proportion of recombinant cells (cells that are lysed by lysogenic phages) should be lower than 50%, indicating recombination. To calculate the exact percentage, we use the formula from the dihybrid cross:\n\nPercentage = ((M1 \u00d7 M2) - (m1 \u00d7 m2)) / (M1 \u00d7 M2)\n\nWhere M1 and M2 are the two parent allele frequencies, and m1 and m2 are the gamete frequencies. But in our case, since it's a single locus, maybe it's simpler. The observed number of lysed cells (on strain B: 40, on strain K:4) suggests that some cells were lysed by both types, while others were only lysed by one type. \n\nAlternatively, considering the dihybrid ratio, if there's no recombination, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But in reality, since only certain combinations lead to specific outcomes, the actual ratio will differ.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the observed distribution. On strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The total number of plumes across both cultures is 40 + 4 = 44. Each plume represents an infection event. \n\nIf there were no recombination, the expected number of lysed cells would follow a 1:1 ratio between the two strains because the lysogenic phage would act uniformly. However, due to recombination, the distribution deviates from this expectation.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 40 plumes on B suggest more cells were lysed by lysogenic phages, and 4 on K suggest fewer. The difference is 40 vs 4, which is almost three times higher. This significant difference indicates that recombination occurred between the two mutations.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed - Expected) / Expected\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of cells lysed by each strain would be equal, say x and x. With recombination, the lysed cells on B would be y and z, and similarly on K. The sum y + z would be less than 2x.\n\nGiven that on B, 40 plumes, and on K, 4, the total is 44. If there's complete dissociation, each strain would have half, so 22 plumes on each. But we have 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. The difference is 38 plumes over 44, which is approximately 86%. That's a high frequency, suggesting significant recombination.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (assuming a two-locus system):\n\nFrequency = (Observed - Expected) / Expected\n\nHere, Expected is 22 (since 44/2=22). Observed is 40 on B and 4 on K. Summing these gives 44, which matches the total.\n\nSo,\n\nFrequency = (40 + 4 - 22) / 22\n= (44 - 22)/22\n= 22/22\n= 1.00\n\nThat's 100%, which seems too high. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps instead, the formula uses the counts from both strata.\n\nAnother approach: Use the formula for recombination frequency as:\n\nf = (R_B - E)/(R_total)\n\nWhere R_B is the number of recombinant events in strain B, R_K in strain K, and E is the expected number under independent assortment.\n\nBut without knowing E, it's tricky. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness of fit.\n\nTotal observed = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nExpected under independence:\nEach strain would have (44/2)=22 plumes.\n\nObserved: 40,4\nExpected:22,22\n\nChi-square = \u03a3( (O-E)^2 / E )\n\nFor strain B: (40-22)^2 /22 \u2248 (38)^2 /22 \u2248 1444/22\u224865.636\n\nFor strain K: (4-22)^2 /22 \u2248 (-18)^2 /22\u2248324/22\u224814.727\n\nTotal \u03c7\u00b2 \u2248 65.636 +14.727\u224880.363\n\nDegrees of freedom = 1\n\nCritical value for \u03b1=0.05 is around 3.84. Our \u03c7\u00b2 is way above that, indicating strong evidence against independence, meaning significant recombination.\n\nCalculating p-value: Using \u03c7\u00b2=80.363, df=1, p is practically zero. So recombination is very high, likely >100%.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, the highest is F. 0.3 percent. Wait, but my calculation suggests more than 100% recombination, which isn't among the options. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Maybe it's expressed as a fraction of the possible recombination sites.\n\nIf the two mutations are on different genes, the maximum possible recombination frequency is 100% (if every cell has a double mutant). But in reality, it's less. Given the data, the recombination frequency is extremely high, but the options don't go beyond 0.5%. Perhaps the answer is D. 0.1 percent or E. 0.2 percent. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of the number of recombinant cells. On B, 40 vs 4 on K. The ratio is 10:1. That's a lot. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the likelihood of each genotype.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mutation independently occurs with probabilities p and q. If there's recombination, the probability of having both mutations is (1-p)(1-q), and the probability of having neither is pq. The observed distribution is 40 on B and 4 on K.\n\nAssuming that the number of cells is large, the expected distribution without recombination would be roughly 50-50 split. But here, it's skewed towards B. The discrepancy is 40 vs 4, which is 39 cells more on B. That's a big difference, suggesting recombination.\n\nThe exact formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nf = (observed_ab - expected_ab) / expected_ab\n\nWhere observed_ab is the number of cells with both mutations, and expected_ab is the number expected under independent assortment. But without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed counts, the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\n(f) = (observed_B + observed_K - 2*expected_BK) / (2*expected_BK)\n\nBut without knowing the expected values, this is unclear.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is to note that the difference between the two is 36 cells (40-4), which is 86% of the total. This suggests a high degree of recombination, possibly approaching 100%. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is related to the observed ratio.\n\nLooking again, the number of plumes on B is 40, on K is 4. That's 10 times more on B. If each mutation contributes to the occurrence of lysogeny, then the combined effect leads to such a high ratio. The possible recombination frequency would correspond to this ratio.\n\nIn the absence of precise calculations, and given the options, the closest plausible answer might be E. 0.2 percent, assuming that even though the ratio is extreme, the frequency isn't exactly 100%.\n\nWait, but 40 vs 4 is a huge difference. It's almost like 100% recombination. None of the options reach 100%. The next option is F. 0.3 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

To calculate the exact percentage, we use the formula from the dihybrid cross:\n\nPercentage = ((M1 \u00d7 M2) - (m1 \u00d7 m2)) / (M1 \u00d7 M2)\n\nWhere M1 and M2 are the two parent allele frequencies, and m1 and m2 are the gamete frequencies. But in our case, since it's a single locus, maybe it's simpler. The observed number of lysed cells (on strain B: 40, on strain K:4) suggests that some cells were lysed by both types, while others were only lysed by one type. \n\nAlternatively, considering the dihybrid ratio, if there's no recombination, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But in reality, since only certain combinations lead to specific outcomes, the actual ratio will differ.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the observed distribution. On strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The total number of plumes across both cultures is 40 + 4 = 44. Each plume represents an infection event. \n\nIf there were no recombination, the expected number of lysed cells would follow a 1:1 ratio between the two strains because the lysogenic phage would act uniformly. However, due to recombination, the distribution deviates from this expectation.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 40 plumes on B suggest more cells were lysed by lysogenic phages, and 4 on K suggest fewer. The difference is 40 vs 4, which is almost three times higher. This significant difference indicates that recombination occurred between the two mutations.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed - Expected) / Expected\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of cells lysed by each strain would be equal, say x and x. With recombination, the lysed cells on B would be y and z, and similarly on K. The sum y + z would be less than 2x.\n\nGiven that on B, 40 plumes, and on K, 4, the total is 44. If there's complete dissociation, each strain would have half, so 22 plumes on each. But we have 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. The difference is 38 plumes over 44, which is approximately 86%. That's a high frequency, suggesting significant recombination.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (assuming a two-locus system):\n\nFrequency = (Observed - Expected) / Expected\n\nHere, Expected is 22 (since 44/2=22). Observed is 40 on B and 4 on K. Summing these gives 44, which matches the total.\n\nSo,\n\nFrequency = (40 + 4 - 22) / 22\n= (44 - 22)/22\n= 22/22\n= 1.00\n\nThat's 100%, which seems too high. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps instead, the formula uses the counts from both strata.\n\nAnother approach: Use the formula for recombination frequency as:\n\nf = (R_B - E)/(R_total)\n\nWhere R_B is the number of recombinant events in strain B, R_K in strain K, and E is the expected number under independent assortment.\n\nBut without knowing E, it's tricky. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness of fit.\n\nTotal observed = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nExpected under independence:\nEach strain would have (44/2)=22 plumes.\n\nObserved: 40,4\nExpected:22,22\n\nChi-square = \u03a3( (O-E)^2 / E )\n\nFor strain B: (40-22)^2 /22 \u2248 (38)^2 /22 \u2248 1444/22\u224865.636\n\nFor strain K: (4-22)^2 /22 \u2248 (-18)^2 /22\u2248324/22\u224814.727\n\nTotal \u03c7\u00b2 \u2248 65.636 +14.727\u224880.363\n\nDegrees of freedom = 1\n\nCritical value for \u03b1=0.05 is around 3.84. Our \u03c7\u00b2 is way above that, indicating strong evidence against independence, meaning significant recombination.\n\nCalculating p-value: Using \u03c7\u00b2=80.363, df=1, p is practically zero. So recombination is very high, likely >100%.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, the highest is F. 0.3 percent. Wait, but my calculation suggests more than 100% recombination, which isn't among the options. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Maybe it's expressed as a fraction of the possible recombination sites.\n\nIf the two mutations are on different genes, the maximum possible recombination frequency is 100% (if every cell has a double mutant). But in reality, it's less. Given the data, the recombination frequency is extremely high, but the options don't go beyond 0.5%. Perhaps the answer is D. 0.1 percent or E. 0.2 percent. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the ratio of the number of recombinant cells. On B, 40 vs 4 on K. The ratio is 10:1. That's a lot. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the likelihood of each genotype.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mutation independently occurs with probabilities p and q. If there's recombination, the probability of having both mutations is (1-p)(1-q), and the probability of having neither is pq. The observed distribution is 40 on B and 4 on K.\n\nAssuming that the number of cells is large, the expected distribution without recombination would be roughly 50-50 split. But here, it's skewed towards B. The discrepancy is 40 vs 4, which is 39 cells more on B. That's a big difference, suggesting recombination.\n\nThe exact formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nf = (observed_ab - expected_ab) / expected_ab\n\nWhere observed_ab is the number of cells with both mutations, and expected_ab is the number expected under independent assortment. But without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed counts, the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\n(f) = (observed_B + observed_K - 2*expected_BK) / (2*expected_BK)\n\nBut without knowing the expected values, this is unclear.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approximation is to note that the difference between the two is 36 cells (40-4), which is 86% of the total. This suggests a high degree of recombination, possibly approaching 100%. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is related to the observed ratio.\n\nLooking again, the number of plumes on B is 40, on K is 4. That's 10 times more on B. If each mutation contributes to the occurrence of lysogeny, then the combined effect leads to such a high ratio. The possible recombination frequency would correspond to this ratio.\n\nIn the absence of precise calculations, and given the options, the closest plausible answer might be E. 0.2 percent, assuming that even though the ratio is extreme, the frequency isn't exactly 100%.\n\nWait, but 40 vs 4 is a huge difference. It's almost like 100% recombination. None of the options reach 100%. The next option is F. 0.3 percent. Maybe that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So more plumes mean more successful infections.",
    "rollout": " So more plumes mean more successful infections.\n\nLet me think about how recombination works. Recombination increases the chance of successful infection because it combines the mutation sites. Normally, without recombination, each mutation would cause independent failures. With recombination, the mutations occur together, increasing the probability that both are present in the host before replication.\n\nThe key here is the number of plumes observed. If there was complete recombination, we'd expect both mutations to be present in every phage that successfully infects the target bacteria. In a normal scenario without recombination, the number of successful infections would depend on the frequency of each mutation independently. However, if there's some degree of recombination, the actual number of plumes should reflect that combined presence.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, 40 plumes were found, while on strain K, 4 were found. That seems like a big difference, which makes sense if there's significant recombination because it means most phages have both mutations, leading to fewer successful infections on B compared to K. \n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, perhaps I can use the formula for expected plumes under full recombination and see what fraction is present. Under full recombination, the number of successful infections would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. But wait, in reality, the number of plumes depends on whether the phage has the mutation or not. Without recombination, you'd get some number of plumes from each mutation type, but with recombination, the phages that have both mutations will lead to less successful infections because they don't replicate as well. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. The number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully replicated and integrated into the bacterial genome. If there's recombination, the phages that integrate the mutations will have a higher chance of successful replication, thus producing fewer plumes than expected without recombination. Conversely, without recombination, the integration would be random, leading to more successful infections. \n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should recall the concept of the coefficient of coincidence. This is used in genetics to measure the likelihood that two loci are inherited together. In this case, the two loci are the two mutations in the phage. The coefficient of coincidence (COC) is calculated as the ratio of observed coincidences to expected coincidences if independent assortment occurred.\n\nIn our case, the observed COC would be the number of plumes where both mutations are present divided by the expected number if they were assorting independently. But I'm not sure if this applies directly here. Alternatively, the number of plumes might relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nWait, let me think again. The number of plumes on strain B is much higher than on strain K. That suggests that the phages carrying both mutations are rare, meaning there's high recombination. High recombination reduces the likelihood of both mutations being present in the same phage, leading to fewer successful infections overall.\n\nBut I need to quantify this. Let's consider the total number of phages in each culture. On strain B's half, the phage concentration is higher because it's plated at a lower dilution (1:10^7), whereas on strain K's half, it's plated at a higher dilution (1:10^5), meaning fewer phages per bacterium. So the total number of phages in strain B's half is much larger than in strain K's half.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R (the proportion of phages that carry both mutations), then the number of phages with both mutations is R * N_B, where N_B is the total phage number in strain B's half. Similarly, for strain K's half, it's R * N_K, where N_K is the total phage number in strain K's half. Since N_B >> N_K, the majority of successful infections come from the phages with both mutations, which explains why fewer plumes are found on strain B.\n\nGiven that, the number of plumes should be proportional to R * N_B / N_K, assuming that the efficiency of replication is similar for both strains. But since the plumes are measured as counts, perhaps the observed number of plumes relates to R.\n\nFrom the data: Strain B has 40 plumes, Strain K has 4. Assuming that the plumes represent the number of phages that successfully integrated and replicated, the ratio of plumes would be 40:4 = 10:1. This implies that the number of phages with both mutations is ten times higher than those with only one mutation. Therefore, R = 1 - p, where p is the probability of no mutation. If R is 9/10, that would imply a low recombination rate, but here R is 10/11 \u2248 0.909, suggesting very little recombination.\n\nWait, but in reality, the exact calculation would require knowing the number of phages with both mutations versus either mutation. Since the problem states that the plateau shows half of the population divided, and upon further dilution, the numbers are significantly different, it's likely that recombination is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the number of recombinants:\n\nNumber of recombinant offspring = (R * N_A * N_B) / (N_A + N_B)\n\nWhere R is the interference (coefficient of coincidence), N_A and N_B are the frequencies of the two loci. But I'm not sure if this is applicable here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler approach is to note that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, indicating that the majority of phages have both mutations. To find the recombination frequency, which is often expressed as the percentage of double crossovers, I can use the formula involving the square root of the expected number of recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plumes, if there's perfect recombination, all phages would have both mutations, resulting in maximum plumes. But in this case, the number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K. Given that the population on B is much larger, the majority of plumes are coming from the phages with both mutations. Thus, recombination must be very low.\n\nAssuming that the plumes correspond to the number of phages with both mutations, and given that 40/4 = 10, the recombination frequency R is approximately 10%. But looking at the options, 10% isn't provided. The closest option is F (0.3%), which is way too low. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the number of plumes as the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. If the recombination frequency is R, then the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is R * P(A) * P(B), where P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of having mutation A and B respectively.\n\nBut without knowing the individual mutation rates, this approach isn't feasible. Alternatively, the number of plumes could indicate the number of successful infections, which would depend on the recombination. For example, if recombination is R, then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is R, so the number of successful infections would be proportional to R.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of plumes is 40:4 = 10:1, which suggests that R is approximately 10%, but since none of the options are around 10%, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is D (0.1%) because the number of plumes is small relative to the population size. Let me recast the problem. The total number of phages in each half: On B's half, it's divided at 1:10^7, meaning 1e7 phages per bacterium. On K's half, it's 1:10^5, so 1e5 phages per bacterium. So the total number of phages on B's half is 1e7, and on K's half, it's 1e5.\n\nAssuming that each bacterium has multiple phages, say n per bacterium, then the total number of phages is n * (1e7) on B and n * (1e5) on K. The number of phages with both mutations is R * n * (1e7) on B and R * n * (1e5) on K. The number of successful infections would be proportional to the number of phages with both mutations, scaled by the efficiency of replication.\n\nGiven that, the number of plumes on B is 40 and on K is 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the number of phages with both mutations on B is 10 times that on K, implying that the recombination frequency is high. But the options don't include 10%. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the expected number of plumes. If there's no recombination, the number of plumes would depend on the sum of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. But with recombination, the probability increases.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be modeled as:\n\nPlumes_on_B = (number_of_phages_with_both_mutations) * efficiency_B\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPlumes_on_K = (number_of_phages_with_both_mutions) * efficiency_K\n\nSince efficiency_B and efficiency_K might differ, but if the phages on B are more numerous, their efficiency might be higher. However, without specific values for efficiencies, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother angle: the ratio of plumes is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the number of phages with both mutations on B is 10 times that on K. Thus, R = 10/(total possible). But if the total possible is much larger, R remains low. However, the options don't include such low percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the square root of (plumes_B / (plumes_B + plumes_K)) ) * 100. Let's try that:\n\nsqrt(40/(40+4)))*100 = sqrt(8.333)*100 \u2248 2.886*100 \u2248 288.6%, which doesn't make sense because recombination frequencies are usually between 0% and 100%.\n\nThat approach is flawed. Maybe another formula: R = (plumes_B / plumes_K)^(1/2). So sqrt(10)\u22483.16%, which is close to option C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). None match exactly, but closer to 1.5% or 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps R = (plumes_B / plumes_K) - 1 = 10-1=9, which would suggest 90% recombination, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely related to the recombination frequency. If R is 10%, then the number of plumes would be reduced by a factor of 10, but the current ratio is 10:1, which fits perfectly. However, since 10% isn't an option, perhaps I've misapplied the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the square root of the ratio gives the approximate number of crossovers. So sqrt(40/4)=sqrt(10)=3.16, which is approximately 3%, corresponding to option F (0.3%).\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested R=10, which is 10%. Since 3% is closer, perhaps the intended answer is F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Looking back at the options, D is 0.1%, which is even smaller. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the square root of the ratio, giving approximately 3%, which rounds to 0.3% (option F). Alternatively, maybe I should take the natural logarithm, but that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = 1 - sqrt(p), where p is the ratio of plumes. If the ratio is 40:4=10:1, then p=10. But that's impossible since R cannot exceed 100%. Alternatively, taking the square root of (plumes_B / plumes_K) gives sqrt(10)=3.16, which is approximately 3%, aligning with option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

However, the options don't include such low percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the square root of (plumes_B / (plumes_B + plumes_K)) ) * 100. Let's try that:\n\nsqrt(40/(40+4)))*100 = sqrt(8.333)*100 \u2248 2.886*100 \u2248 288.6%, which doesn't make sense because recombination frequencies are usually between 0% and 100%.\n\nThat approach is flawed. Maybe another formula: R = (plumes_B / plumes_K)^(1/2). So sqrt(10)\u22483.16%, which is close to option C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). None match exactly, but closer to 1.5% or 0.3%. Alternatively, perhaps R = (plumes_B / plumes_K) - 1 = 10-1=9, which would suggest 90% recombination, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is inversely related to the recombination frequency. If R is 10%, then the number of plumes would be reduced by a factor of 10, but the current ratio is 10:1, which fits perfectly. However, since 10% isn't an option, perhaps I've misapplied the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the square root of the ratio gives the approximate number of crossovers. So sqrt(40/4)=sqrt(10)=3.16, which is approximately 3%, corresponding to option F (0.3%).\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested R=10, which is 10%. Since 3% is closer, perhaps the intended answer is F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Looking back at the options, D is 0.1%, which is even smaller. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the square root of the ratio, giving approximately 3%, which rounds to 0.3% (option F). Alternatively, maybe I should take the natural logarithm, but that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = 1 - sqrt(p), where p is the ratio of plumes. If the ratio is 40:4=10:1, then p=10. But that's impossible since R cannot exceed 100%. Alternatively, taking the square root of (plumes_B / plumes_K) gives sqrt(10)=3.16, which is approximately 3%, aligning with option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So 40 plumes on strain B mean 40 infections of phage T_4 with the lysogenic mutation, right?",
    "rollout": " So 40 plumes on strain B mean 40 infections of phage T_4 with the lysogenic mutation, right? And 4 plumes on strain K mean 4 infections of phage T_4 with the lytic mutation.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Each plate has multiple plumes. If you have a lot of dilution, you get fewer plumes. For example, if you dilute the phage solution by 1:10^7, then in a 1 ml plate, you'd have 10^-7 * 1 ml = 1e-7 phages. But wait, actually, when you dilute the phage solution, say 1e7 times, each original phage becomes 1e-7 phages in the test tube. So if you plate on a strain B lawn, you would expect about 1 phage per area for normal growth, but for mutants, it depends on their presence.\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of expected plumes. In the first scenario where only lysogenic phages are present, all E. coli should be lysed, so no plumes on strain B's lawn. However, in reality, there are plumes on strain B's lawn, meaning some lysogenic phages are infecting E. coli strain B, leading to lytic fission. Similarly, if only lysogenic phages are present, none would cause issues, but here there are plumes on strain B's lawn, implying that at least some lysogenic phages are causing problems.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the experiment: half of the bacteria is treated with a 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K's lawn. So in this case, only the lytic phages are present, as we're using lysogenic phages from the first half. Wait, no\u2014the first half was lysogenic, so the second half must be lysogenic too? Or maybe the first half had both lysogenic and something else, but according to the problem, the first half was only lysogenic. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try another approach. The observed plumes indicate how many phages have mutated. Since the first sample (strain B's lawn) shows 40 plumes, that implies 40 phages have the lysogenic mutation. The second sample (strain K's lawn) shows 4 plumes, indicating 4 phages have the lytic mutation. Now, the total number of phages plated in each sample is important. If the first sample was plated at a higher concentration (diluted more), then the expected number of plumes depends on the dilution factor.\n\nIn the first case, the phage was plated at 1:10^7, meaning each original phage contributes 1e-7 phages. The number of plumes would be proportional to the concentration of phages in the test tube. If I assume that the initial population was N phages, then the number of plumes would be approximately N * (1/10^7). But actually, the expected number of plumes is often considered as the concentration of phages multiplied by the area, assuming Poisson statistics. Alternatively, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of phages present in the area being plated.\n\nSo, if the first sample (strain B) had 40 plumes, each corresponding to a certain number of phages. Let's denote the number of phages in the first sample as P1. Then, the number of plumes M1 = P1 / D1, where D1 is the dilution factor. Here, D1 = 10^7. So, 40 = P1 / 10^7 \u2192 P1 = 40 * 10^7 = 4e9 phages.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample (strain K), the number of plumes M2 = 4. Assuming the same area, the number of phages P2 = M2 * D2 = 4 * 10^5 = 4e5 phages.\n\nNow, the key is to find the number of recombinants between the two mutations. Recombination occurs when a single mutation influences both regions, so the probability of recombination would depend on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, in this context, each mutation is in different regions (lytic vs. lysogenic), so the recombination frequency would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant plages would correspond to the product of the concentrations of the two mutations. But perhaps a simpler way is to use the formula:\n\nRecombinant rate = (number of plumes due to recombination) / (total plumes)\n\nThe number of recombinant plumes would be equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations, which is the product of the fractions of each mutation. If p is the fraction of lysogenic phages and q is the fraction of lytic phages, then the recombinant fraction would be pq. Therefore, the number of recombinant plumes would be (p*q)*N, where N is the total number of phages plated.\n\nFrom the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is P1 / S1, where S1 is the area plated. Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the frequency of each mutation.\n\nFrequency of lysogenic phages, p = M1 / P_total = 40 / (40 + 4) \u2248 86.67%.\nFrequency of lytic phages, q = 4 / 40 = 10%.\n\nBut wait, the total plumes in the first sample are 40 lysogenic and 4 lytic, totaling 44. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts my earlier thought. Actually, in the first sample, the lysogenic phages caused plumes, while the lytic ones didn't. So the number of lysogenic phages in that sample is 40, and the lytic ones are 4. So total phages in that sample are 44.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, the lysogenic phages (from the first sample?) No, the second sample is a separate group. Wait, no\u2014probably, each sample is independent. Let me clarify.\n\nThe first sample (strain B's lawn) has 40 plumes, which represent the lysogenic phages. The second sample (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes, representing the lytic phages. Both samples are taken from the same population, so the frequencies can be calculated separately.\n\nWait, but the total number of phages in the first sample is 40 + 4 = 44. So the frequency of lysogenic phages is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, and the lytic phages are 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. \n\nHowever, the second sample is a separate set of phages. It's unclear whether its phage solutions were from the same pool. Maybe they are, but it's possible that they came from different sources, so the frequencies might differ.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the first sample is from a population where both mutations are present, and the second sample is from a pure lysogenic population. But that seems unlikely because the second sample is supposed to show only the lytic effect, suggesting that the lysogenic phages don't contribute to the issue in the second sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's suppose that the total number of phages in the first sample is N1, and in the second sample, N2. The number of lysogenic phages in the first sample is L1 = 40, and the number of lytic phages is Y1 = 4. The number of lysogenic phages in the second sample is L2 = 4, and the lytic phages are Y2 = ?\n\nAssuming that the total number of phages in each sample is the same, say N. Then, in the first sample, the fraction of lysogenic phages is L1/N = 40/N, and in the second sample, it's L2/N = 4/N.\n\nIf the two samples come from the same source, then the fractions would be consistent. Otherwise, they could be different.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, perhaps we can proceed by considering the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is typically denoted as 'f' and is the proportion of individuals with both mutations. The number of such individuals would be f*N, where N is the total number of individuals.\n\nIn our case, the first sample shows 40 plumes, which are lysogenic, and the second sample shows 4 plumes, which are lytic. So, in the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and in the second sample, it's 4. Assuming that the total number of phages in each sample is the same, say N, then the expected number of lysogenic phages in the first sample is 40 = N * p, and in the second sample, 4 = N * p', where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages in the first sample and p' in the second.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plumes (which would correspond to phages carrying both mutations) is the product of the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant plumes R would be p*q*N, where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages and q is the frequency of lytic phages. From the first sample, we have p = 40/(40+4) \u2248 0.909. From the second sample, we have q = 4/(4+40) = 0.091. So R \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, or 8.3% of the total plumes would be recombinant.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations, which would relate to the number of recombinant plumes divided by the total number of plumes. However, in the given data, the first sample shows 40 plumes, and the second shows 4, making a total of 44 plumes across both samples. But this might not directly translate to the actual population.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency is the product of the frequencies of each mutation, and since each sample reflects the combined effect of both mutations, perhaps the recombination frequency is estimated by comparing the observed plumes between the two samples.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that each mutation affects the growth rate in a different way. The lysogenic phage increases the replication efficiency, while the lytic phage causes death upon lysis. When both types are present, the combination leads to increased lytic activity, which is what is observed in the second sample.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can look at the ratio of the number of recombinant plumes to the total number of plumes. The number of recombinant plumes would be equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations. Given that the first sample shows 40 plumes (lysogenic) and the second shows 4 plumes (lytic), the total number of phages is the sum of lysogenic and lytic in each sample.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the frequency of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote F_L as the frequency of lysogenic phages and F_Y as the frequency of lytic phages. In the first sample, F_L = 40/44 \u2248 0.909 and F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. In the second sample, since it's a separate set, F_Y would be 4/N, where N is the size of the second sample. If we assume the same sample size, say N=44, then F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. Thus, the product F_L * F_Y \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, which is 8.3%. This would imply that about 8.3% of the phages have both mutations, i.e., recombine.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, so 8.3% would correspond to option B: 2 percent. But that's a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombinant plumes is the number of phages carrying both mutations, which would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But in the first sample, the frequency of lysogenic is ~90.9%, and in the second sample, it's ~9.1%. Multiplying these gives roughly 8.3%, which is about 8%. That's close to option B, which is 2%, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the recombination frequency is the product of the two frequencies, which is indeed 8.3%, but the options don't include that. The closest is B: 2%, which is off by a factor of four. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the concept.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plumes is equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations. Given that, in the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and in the second sample, the number of lytic phages is 4. Assuming that the total number of phages is the same in both samples, then the expected number of recombinant phages would be (40 * 4)/(40 + 4) \u2248 (160)/44 \u2248 3.64. But this seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the expected number of recombinant plumes is the product of the concentrations of each mutation. Since the first sample showed 40 plumes (lysogenic), and the second sample shows 4 plumes (lytic), the number of recombinant plumes would be (40/44)*(4/44) * Total_plumes. But without knowing the total number of plumes, it's hard to compute.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I should refer back to the basic principles. Recombination frequency (RF) is the probability that a crossover occurs between two points in the DNA during meiosis. In the context of phages, it refers to the probability that a phage carries both mutations, thereby causing a change in their host's replication dynamics. The RF is often calculated as the product of the frequencies of each mutation, assuming independence.\n\nGiven that, if the first sample (strain B's lawn) has 40 plumes (lysogenic) and the second sample (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes (lytic), the RF can be approximated by the ratio of plumes in the second sample to the total plumes in both samples. The total plumes in both samples are 40 + 4 = 44. The RF would then be 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, or 9.1%, but this doesn't match any of the provided options except E, which is 0.02%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is that the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of lysogenic phages in the first sample and the number of lytic phages in the second sample. If the first sample has 40 lysogenic and the second has 4 lytic, then 40*4=160 potential recombinants. But this doesn't align with the options either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall standard approaches. Typically, in such experiments, the number of recombinant plumes is determined by the product of the frequencies of each mutation. So, if F_L is the frequency of lysogenic phages and F_Y is the frequency of lytic phages, then RF = F_L * F_Y. In the first sample, F_L = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. So RF \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, or 8.3%. But again, this isn't among the options.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the closest is B: 2 percent. However, 8.3% is closer to option C: 1.5 percent, but that's still lower than the actual value. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plumes and recombinants.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of each type of phage. In the first sample, there are 40 lysogenic phages and 4 lytic phages. The number of recombinant phages would be the minimum of these two, which is 4. Because each lysogenic phage can potentially form a recombinant pair with each lytic phage, but realistically, you can't have more than the smaller number. So, 4 recombinant plumes.\n\nThen, the RF would be 4 (recomb.) / (40 lys. + 4 lytic) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, which is about 9.1%. Still, this isn't matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as the ratio of the number of recombinant plumes to the total number of plumes, which would be 4/(40 + 4) = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The answer likely relates to the product of the mutation frequencies. If each mutation has a certain frequency, the recombination frequency is the product of those frequencies.\n\nIn the first sample, the frequency of lysogenic phages is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, and the frequency of lytic phages is 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. Multiplying these gives approximately 8.3%. But since the options don't include 8.3%, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of lysogenic and lytic phages. So, 40 * 4 = 160 plasmids. But the total number of plumes across both samples is 44, so 160 / 44 \u2248 3.64. That's even worse.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the number of recombinant plumes is",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes on strain B mean 40 infections of phage T_4 with the lysogenic mutation, right? And 4 plumes on strain K mean 4 infections of phage T_4 with the lytic mutation.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Each plate has multiple plumes. If you have a lot of dilution, you get fewer plumes. For example, if you dilute the phage solution by 1:10^7, then in a 1 ml plate, you'd have 10^-7 * 1 ml = 1e-7 phages. But wait, actually, when you dilute the phage solution, say 1e7 times, each original phage becomes 1e-7 phages in the test tube. So if you plate on a strain B lawn, you would expect about 1 phage per area for normal growth, but for mutants, it depends on their presence.\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of expected plumes. In the first scenario where only lysogenic phages are present, all E. coli should be lysed, so no plumes on strain B's lawn. However, in reality, there are plumes on strain B's lawn, meaning some lysogenic phages are infecting E. coli strain B, leading to lytic fission. Similarly, if only lysogenic phages are present, none would cause issues, but here there are plumes on strain B's lawn, implying that at least some lysogenic phages are causing problems.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the experiment: half of the bacteria is treated with a 1:10^5 dilution and plated on strain K's lawn. So in this case, only the lytic phages are present, as we're using lysogenic phages from the first half. Wait, no\u2014the first half was lysogenic, so the second half must be lysogenic too? Or maybe the first half had both lysogenic and something else, but according to the problem, the first half was only lysogenic. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try another approach. The observed plumes indicate how many phages have mutated. Since the first sample (strain B's lawn) shows 40 plumes, that implies 40 phages have the lysogenic mutation. The second sample (strain K's lawn) shows 4 plumes, indicating 4 phages have the lytic mutation. Now, the total number of phages plated in each sample is important. If the first sample was plated at a higher concentration (diluted more), then the expected number of plumes depends on the dilution factor.\n\nIn the first case, the phage was plated at 1:10^7, meaning each original phage contributes 1e-7 phages. The number of plumes would be proportional to the concentration of phages in the test tube. If I assume that the initial population was N phages, then the number of plumes would be approximately N * (1/10^7). But actually, the expected number of plumes is often considered as the concentration of phages multiplied by the area, assuming Poisson statistics. Alternatively, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of phages present in the area being plated.\n\nSo, if the first sample (strain B) had 40 plumes, each corresponding to a certain number of phages. Let's denote the number of phages in the first sample as P1. Then, the number of plumes M1 = P1 / D1, where D1 is the dilution factor. Here, D1 = 10^7. So, 40 = P1 / 10^7 \u2192 P1 = 40 * 10^7 = 4e9 phages.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample (strain K), the number of plumes M2 = 4. Assuming the same area, the number of phages P2 = M2 * D2 = 4 * 10^5 = 4e5 phages.\n\nNow, the key is to find the number of recombinants between the two mutations. Recombination occurs when a single mutation influences both regions, so the probability of recombination would depend on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, in this context, each mutation is in different regions (lytic vs. lysogenic), so the recombination frequency would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of recombinant plages would correspond to the product of the concentrations of the two mutations. But perhaps a simpler way is to use the formula:\n\nRecombinant rate = (number of plumes due to recombination) / (total plumes)\n\nThe number of recombinant plumes would be equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations, which is the product of the fractions of each mutation. If p is the fraction of lysogenic phages and q is the fraction of lytic phages, then the recombinant fraction would be pq. Therefore, the number of recombinant plumes would be (p*q)*N, where N is the total number of phages plated.\n\nFrom the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is P1 / S1, where S1 is the area plated. Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the frequency of each mutation.\n\nFrequency of lysogenic phages, p = M1 / P_total = 40 / (40 + 4) \u2248 86.67%.\nFrequency of lytic phages, q = 4 / 40 = 10%.\n\nBut wait, the total plumes in the first sample are 40 lysogenic and 4 lytic, totaling 44. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts my earlier thought. Actually, in the first sample, the lysogenic phages caused plumes, while the lytic ones didn't. So the number of lysogenic phages in that sample is 40, and the lytic ones are 4. So total phages in that sample are 44.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, the lysogenic phages (from the first sample?) No, the second sample is a separate group. Wait, no\u2014probably, each sample is independent. Let me clarify.\n\nThe first sample (strain B's lawn) has 40 plumes, which represent the lysogenic phages. The second sample (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes, representing the lytic phages. Both samples are taken from the same population, so the frequencies can be calculated separately.\n\nWait, but the total number of phages in the first sample is 40 + 4 = 44. So the frequency of lysogenic phages is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, and the lytic phages are 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. \n\nHowever, the second sample is a separate set of phages. It's unclear whether its phage solutions were from the same pool. Maybe they are, but it's possible that they came from different sources, so the frequencies might differ.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the first sample is from a population where both mutations are present, and the second sample is from a pure lysogenic population. But that seems unlikely because the second sample is supposed to show only the lytic effect, suggesting that the lysogenic phages don't contribute to the issue in the second sample.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's suppose that the total number of phages in the first sample is N1, and in the second sample, N2. The number of lysogenic phages in the first sample is L1 = 40, and the number of lytic phages is Y1 = 4. The number of lysogenic phages in the second sample is L2 = 4, and the lytic phages are Y2 = ?\n\nAssuming that the total number of phages in each sample is the same, say N. Then, in the first sample, the fraction of lysogenic phages is L1/N = 40/N, and in the second sample, it's L2/N = 4/N.\n\nIf the two samples come from the same source, then the fractions would be consistent. Otherwise, they could be different.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, perhaps we can proceed by considering the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is typically denoted as 'f' and is the proportion of individuals with both mutations. The number of such individuals would be f*N, where N is the total number of individuals.\n\nIn our case, the first sample shows 40 plumes, which are lysogenic, and the second sample shows 4 plumes, which are lytic. So, in the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and in the second sample, it's 4. Assuming that the total number of phages in each sample is the same, say N, then the expected number of lysogenic phages in the first sample is 40 = N * p, and in the second sample, 4 = N * p', where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages in the first sample and p' in the second.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plumes (which would correspond to phages carrying both mutations) is the product of the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant plumes R would be p*q*N, where p is the frequency of lysogenic phages and q is the frequency of lytic phages. From the first sample, we have p = 40/(40+4) \u2248 0.909. From the second sample, we have q = 4/(4+40) = 0.091. So R \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, or 8.3% of the total plumes would be recombinant.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations, which would relate to the number of recombinant plumes divided by the total number of plumes. However, in the given data, the first sample shows 40 plumes, and the second shows 4, making a total of 44 plumes across both samples. But this might not directly translate to the actual population.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency is the product of the frequencies of each mutation, and since each sample reflects the combined effect of both mutations, perhaps the recombination frequency is estimated by comparing the observed plumes between the two samples.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that each mutation affects the growth rate in a different way. The lysogenic phage increases the replication efficiency, while the lytic phage causes death upon lysis. When both types are present, the combination leads to increased lytic activity, which is what is observed in the second sample.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can look at the ratio of the number of recombinant plumes to the total number of plumes. The number of recombinant plumes would be equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations. Given that the first sample shows 40 plumes (lysogenic) and the second shows 4 plumes (lytic), the total number of phages is the sum of lysogenic and lytic in each sample.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the frequency of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote F_L as the frequency of lysogenic phages and F_Y as the frequency of lytic phages. In the first sample, F_L = 40/44 \u2248 0.909 and F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. In the second sample, since it's a separate set, F_Y would be 4/N, where N is the size of the second sample. If we assume the same sample size, say N=44, then F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. Thus, the product F_L * F_Y \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, which is 8.3%. This would imply that about 8.3% of the phages have both mutations, i.e., recombine.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, so 8.3% would correspond to option B: 2 percent. But that's a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombinant plumes is the number of phages carrying both mutations, which would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But in the first sample, the frequency of lysogenic is ~90.9%, and in the second sample, it's ~9.1%. Multiplying these gives roughly 8.3%, which is about 8%. That's close to option B, which is 2%, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the recombination frequency is the product of the two frequencies, which is indeed 8.3%, but the options don't include that. The closest is B: 2%, which is off by a factor of four. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the concept.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plumes is equal to the number of phages carrying both mutations. Given that, in the first sample, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and in the second sample, the number of lytic phages is 4. Assuming that the total number of phages is the same in both samples, then the expected number of recombinant phages would be (40 * 4)/(40 + 4) \u2248 (160)/44 \u2248 3.64. But this seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the expected number of recombinant plumes is the product of the concentrations of each mutation. Since the first sample showed 40 plumes (lysogenic), and the second sample shows 4 plumes (lytic), the number of recombinant plumes would be (40/44)*(4/44) * Total_plumes. But without knowing the total number of plumes, it's hard to compute.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I should refer back to the basic principles. Recombination frequency (RF) is the probability that a crossover occurs between two points in the DNA during meiosis. In the context of phages, it refers to the probability that a phage carries both mutations, thereby causing a change in their host's replication dynamics. The RF is often calculated as the product of the frequencies of each mutation, assuming independence.\n\nGiven that, if the first sample (strain B's lawn) has 40 plumes (lysogenic) and the second sample (strain K's lawn) has 4 plumes (lytic), the RF can be approximated by the ratio of plumes in the second sample to the total plumes in both samples. The total plumes in both samples are 40 + 4 = 44. The RF would then be 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, or 9.1%, but this doesn't match any of the provided options except E, which is 0.02%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is that the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of lysogenic phages in the first sample and the number of lytic phages in the second sample. If the first sample has 40 lysogenic and the second has 4 lytic, then 40*4=160 potential recombinants. But this doesn't align with the options either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall standard approaches. Typically, in such experiments, the number of recombinant plumes is determined by the product of the frequencies of each mutation. So, if F_L is the frequency of lysogenic phages and F_Y is the frequency of lytic phages, then RF = F_L * F_Y. In the first sample, F_L = 40/44 \u2248 0.909, F_Y = 4/44 \u2248 0.091. So RF \u2248 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 0.083, or 8.3%. But again, this isn't among the options.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the closest is B: 2 percent. However, 8.3% is closer to option C: 1.5 percent, but that's still lower than the actual value. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between plumes and recombinants.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of each type of phage. In the first sample, there are 40 lysogenic phages and 4 lytic phages. The number of recombinant phages would be the minimum of these two, which is 4. Because each lysogenic phage can potentially form a recombinant pair with each lytic phage, but realistically, you can't have more than the smaller number. So, 4 recombinant plumes.\n\nThen, the RF would be 4 (recomb.) / (40 lys. + 4 lytic) = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, which is about 9.1%. Still, this isn't matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as the ratio of the number of recombinant plumes to the total number of plumes, which would be 4/(40 + 4) = 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The answer likely relates to the product of the mutation frequencies. If each mutation has a certain frequency, the recombination frequency is the product of those frequencies.\n\nIn the first sample, the frequency of lysogenic phages is 40/44 \u2248 90.9%, and the frequency of lytic phages is 4/44 \u2248 9.1%. Multiplying these gives approximately 8.3%. But since the options don't include 8.3%, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombinant plumes is the product of the number of lysogenic and lytic phages. So, 40 * 4 = 160 plasmids. But the total number of plumes across both samples is 44, so 160 / 44 \u2248 3.64. That's even worse.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the number of recombinant plumes is",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",

    "rollout": " So 40 on B mean 40 phages integrated successfully in B's lawn, and 4 on K mean 4 phages integrated in K's lawn.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Actually, when you plate the phage on the lawn, each phage has a chance to integrate into the E. coli chromosome. If integration occurs, it becomes a functional phage. The number of successful infections corresponds to the number of recombinants.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, the phages cause different behaviors. In the first case, only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, so the lysogenic phage would replicate without being lysed, leading to more lytic fission. However, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, causing its lytic fission. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, while the wild-type phage does. So if a phage is lysogenic, it won't lyse, otherwise, it will.\n\nIn the initial scenario, when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B should lyse all cells because the phage isn't lysogenic. But the problem says that both types of phage (mutant and wild type) together affect strain B, implying that some combination happened. Maybe the phages are integrating, causing a mix of their effects.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the phages are mixed, the division outcome depends on the dilution and the subsequent plating on the respective strains.\n\nSo, let me think about how the data relates to recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material between two phages during integration. If two phages have different mutation patterns (e.g., one has mutation A and the other mutation B), their integration could lead to either a recombinant or non-recombinant offspring phage.\n\nIn the context of the experiment:\n\n- The presence of both mutant and wild-type phages leads to varying outcomes depending on whether they integrated.\n- The observed plasmid counts on each strain suggest that some combinations occurred.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Two types of mutantphages are present: one causes lysogenic fission (let's call it M1) and another may cause some mutation (M2) which might interfere with integration or cause a different outcome.\n\n2. Both types are mixed together, so when they integrate, they can form a new phage (maybe M1/M2 or M2/M1).\n\n3. The resulting phages then infect E. coli strain B. If they integrate, they become active phages; otherwise, they don't.\n\n4. The initial test plate (diluted 1:10^7) has 40 plumes on B. That means 40 phages integrated successfully here. Since the original phage was lysogenic (as per the problem statement), the integration must be with M1 (the lysogenic phage). Because if it integrated with M2, which is perhaps a different mutation, it wouldn't cause lysis\u2014so why did strain B lyse? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the problem says that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates with the wild-type, but the other phage doesn't. Or maybe the other phage causes a mutation that prevents integration.\n\nWait, the problem says that \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strain K.\" So the lysogenic phage (which carries rII mutations) doesn't cause lysis for strain B but does for K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage integrates into strain B's genome, allowing it to replicate without being lysed, while the other type of phage (if it's lysogenic as well) would not cause such effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other phage carries a mutation that prevents integration into strain B's genome, so it doesn't cause lysis even when integrated.\n\nBut back to the experiment. When both types of mutantphages are present, they are mixed and then plated on strain B's lawn. Strain B shows 40 plumes, meaning 40 phages integrated successfully. That suggests that these 40 phages incorporated into the strain B's genome. Similarly, when the same phages are plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appear. That implies that among the 40 successful integrations in B's lawn, 4 resulted from the phages carrying mutations that interfere with integration in K.\n\nTherefore, the number of recombinant phages is 4, out of 40 total successful infections. So the proportion is 4/40 = 1/10, or 10%.\n\nRecombination refers to the probability that a mutation in one phage integrates with a mutation in another phage. If recombination rate is high, say R%, then the fraction of phages that integrate with a specific mutation is roughly R%. For example, if R is 50%, then half of the phages integrated with the first mutation, and the other half integrated with the second.\n\nHowever, in this case, we're looking at the fraction of phages that integrated successfully in the B culture versus K culture. Since in the B culture, 40 phages integrated, and in the K culture, only 4 did, this suggests that some of the phages integrated into B but not into K, indicating that their integration site is different in K compared to B.\n\nIf the recombination rate is low, say 1%, then approximately 1% of the phages integrate into a particular mutation site. So, out of the 40 phages in B, about 1% would integrate into the mutation in B, resulting in 0.4 phages, but we saw 4 plumes, so higher than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site in B's culture is 40, and in K's culture is 4. Assuming that the integration is random, the expected number of recombinants in K would depend on the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is R, then the fraction of phages that integrate into the K mutation site would be R multiplied by the fraction that already integrated into B's site.\n\nWait, but in reality, the integration sites are independent unless recombination occurs. So the overall fraction of phages integrating into any site is R. Therefore, the expected number of phages integrating into K's site in B's culture would be (R / 100) * 40. We observed 4, so 4 = (R / 100)*40 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%. But none of the options go up to 25%. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant events + Number of parental events) / Total number of events \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events is the number that integrated into K's site. Since in B's culture, 40 phages integrated, and in K's culture, 4 did, assuming that the integration is independent except for recombination, the number of recombinants would be (R/100)*40, where R is the recombination frequency. But according to our observation, this equals 4. So:\n\n(R/100)*40 = 4 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%\n\nAgain, 25% is not one of the options. Wait, looking back at the options provided: F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc. So perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of phages that integrated into the K site is 4, while those that integrated into the B site is 40. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. This suggests that only 10% of the phages that integrated into B also integrated into K. Which would imply a very low recombination rate, possibly around 1%.\n\nBecause if recombination rate R is 1%, then the fraction integrating into K would be R*(fraction integrating into B). But since all phages are integrated once, the fraction integrating into K would be R * 1, because all phages integrated once. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the phages in B have already integrated into B, and the ones in K are the new ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that the number of recombinants (integrated into K) is (R/100)*40. And we know that the number of recombinants is 4. So:\n\n4 = (R/100)*40 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%\n\nAgain, 25%. None of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The phages in B's culture had 40 successful infections, and in K's culture, 4. So the number of recombinants in K's culture is 4. If the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of recombinants in K's culture would be R multiplied by the number of phages that integrated into B's site. But since the phages integrate independently, the expected number is R * 40. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s the fraction of phages that integrate into the K site, which is R times the fraction that integrated into B's site. But since all phages integrate exactly once, the total fraction is R, so the number in K's culture would be R * 40. So:\n\n4 = R * 40 \u2192 R = 4/40 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nAh! So the recombination rate R is 10%, which corresponds to option D: 0.1 percent. Wait, but 10% is option C: 1.5 percent? No, 10% is not listed. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nSo 10% isn't directly listed, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check again:\n\nIf the number of recombinants in K's culture is 4, and this is equal to R * 40 (since 40 phages integrated in B's culture), then R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But none of the options have 10%. The closest is C: 1.5% or D: 0.1%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the numbers. The problem states that four plumes are found on K and four hundred on B. Wait, no: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So 4 on K, 40 on B. So 4 = R * 40 \u2192 R = 0.1, which is 10%. But 10% isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in the B culture integrate into the lysogenic site, and those in the K culture integrate into the mutation site. So the number of recombinants in K is the number of phages that integrated into K's site, which is 4. The total number of phages that could integrate is 40 (from B's culture). So the fraction is 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in the B culture are the ones that integrate into the lysogenic site, and the phages in the K culture are the ones that integrate into the mutation site. So the number of recombinants in K is 4, which is R times the number of phages in B's culture. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%, still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in B's culture include both lysogenic and mutated, but upon integration, only lysogenic remains. Then, the number of phages that successfully integrated into the lysogenic site is 40. Among these, 4 became mutants, and 36 remained as lysogenic. Wait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phage caused lysis in B, so the others didn't. So perhaps the 40 successful integrations included both the lysogenic and the mutant phages. But the mutant phages didn't cause lysis, so they died immediately, leaving only the lysogenic phages. Therefore, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and the rest of the phages (from the B culture) must have been the mutant phages that didn't integrate successfully. But this complicates things further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows:\n\nTotal phages in B culture: All phages from both mutant and wild types. Upon integration, lysogenic phages remain, while the others die. So, in the B culture, the number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site is equal to the number of phages in the B culture minus the number that died due to mutation. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutant and wild-type phages are present, and the B culture is plated with a certain dilution, the number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site (and thus survive) is proportional to the number of phages present in the B culture. Similarly, phages that integrate into the mutant site (and die) would leave behind the lysogenic phages. \n\nGiven that in the B culture, 40 phages integrated into the lysogenic site, and in the K culture, 4 did so. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. Assuming that the integration sites are distinct, the fraction of phages that integrate into the K site is 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, but that doesn't align with the previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombinant phages in K is 4, which is R multiplied by the number of phages that integrated into B's site. So R = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Maybe the B culture had 40 phages integrate, and the K culture had 4. The recombination rate is calculated as 4 / (number of phages in B culture that could integrate). If the number of phages in B culture that could integrate is 40, then R = 4/40 = 0.1 or 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but 0.1 is much larger.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted the numbers. Perhaps the number of recombinants in K is 4, and the number of phages that could integrate in K is 40. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible, which would be 100%, so 10% would correspond to option C: 1.5%, which is closer than D: 0.1%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options and see which makes sense. If the number of recombinants in K is 4, and the total number of phages that could integrate in B's culture is 40, then the recombination rate is 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But the closest option is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, which is tenfold smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the reciprocal, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try again. The number of phages that integrated into the lysogenic site in B's culture is 40, and in K's culture, it's 4. The difference is 36. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of recombinants in K's culture is R multiplied by the number of phages in B's culture that could integrate. Assuming that all phages integrate exactly once, then R = 4 / 40 = 0.1 or 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that contradicts 0.1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the numbers. The problem states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So 40 phages integrated in B's culture, and 4 in K's. The ratio is 1:10. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of recombinants in K is R * (number of phages in B's culture). But the number of phages in B's culture that could integrate is 40. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant events + Number of parental events) / Total number of events \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events is 4 (in K), and the number of parental events is (40 - 4) = 36, assuming that the remaining phages didn't integrate into the lysogenic site. But I'm not sure if this is applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is simply the proportion of phages that integrated into the K site, which is 4 / 40 = 0.1 or 10%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that's way off. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the direction of the phages' mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that interferes with integration, so when it integrates into the lysogenic site, it doesn't cause lysis.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 on B mean 40 phages integrated successfully in B's lawn, and 4 on K mean 4 phages integrated in K's lawn.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Actually, when you plate the phage on the lawn, each phage has a chance to integrate into the E. coli chromosome. If integration occurs, it becomes a functional phage. The number of successful infections corresponds to the number of recombinants.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, the phages cause different behaviors. In the first case, only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, so the lysogenic phage would replicate without being lysed, leading to more lytic fission. However, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, causing its lytic fission. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, while the wild-type phage does. So if a phage is lysogenic, it won't lyse, otherwise, it will.\n\nIn the initial scenario, when only lysogenic phage is present, strain B should lyse all cells because the phage isn't lysogenic. But the problem says that both types of phage (mutant and wild type) together affect strain B, implying that some combination happened. Maybe the phages are integrating, causing a mix of their effects.\n\nThe experiment shows that when the phages are mixed, the division outcome depends on the dilution and the subsequent plating on the respective strains.\n\nSo, let me think about how the data relates to recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material between two phages during integration. If two phages have different mutation patterns (e.g., one has mutation A and the other mutation B), their integration could lead to either a recombinant or non-recombinant offspring phage.\n\nIn the context of the experiment:\n\n- The presence of both mutant and wild-type phages leads to varying outcomes depending on whether they integrated.\n- The observed plasmid counts on each strain suggest that some combinations occurred.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Two types of mutantphages are present: one causes lysogenic fission (let's call it M1) and another may cause some mutation (M2) which might interfere with integration or cause a different outcome.\n\n2. Both types are mixed together, so when they integrate, they can form a new phage (maybe M1/M2 or M2/M1).\n\n3. The resulting phages then infect E. coli strain B. If they integrate, they become active phages; otherwise, they don't.\n\n4. The initial test plate (diluted 1:10^7) has 40 plumes on B. That means 40 phages integrated successfully here. Since the original phage was lysogenic (as per the problem statement), the integration must be with M1 (the lysogenic phage). Because if it integrated with M2, which is perhaps a different mutation, it wouldn't cause lysis\u2014so why did strain B lyse? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the problem says that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates with the wild-type, but the other phage doesn't. Or maybe the other phage causes a mutation that prevents integration.\n\nWait, the problem says that \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strain K.\" So the lysogenic phage (which carries rII mutations) doesn't cause lysis for strain B but does for K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage integrates into strain B's genome, allowing it to replicate without being lysed, while the other type of phage (if it's lysogenic as well) would not cause such effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other phage carries a mutation that prevents integration into strain B's genome, so it doesn't cause lysis even when integrated.\n\nBut back to the experiment. When both types of mutantphages are present, they are mixed and then plated on strain B's lawn. Strain B shows 40 plumes, meaning 40 phages integrated successfully. That suggests that these 40 phages incorporated into the strain B's genome. Similarly, when the same phages are plated on strain K, only 4 plumes appear. That implies that among the 40 successful integrations in B's lawn, 4 resulted from the phages carrying mutations that interfere with integration in K.\n\nTherefore, the number of recombinant phages is 4, out of 40 total successful infections. So the proportion is 4/40 = 1/10, or 10%.\n\nRecombination refers to the probability that a mutation in one phage integrates with a mutation in another phage. If recombination rate is high, say R%, then the fraction of phages that integrate with a specific mutation is roughly R%. For example, if R is 50%, then half of the phages integrated with the first mutation, and the other half integrated with the second.\n\nHowever, in this case, we're looking at the fraction of phages that integrated successfully in the B culture versus K culture. Since in the B culture, 40 phages integrated, and in the K culture, only 4 did, this suggests that some of the phages integrated into B but not into K, indicating that their integration site is different in K compared to B.\n\nIf the recombination rate is low, say 1%, then approximately 1% of the phages integrate into a particular mutation site. So, out of the 40 phages in B, about 1% would integrate into the mutation in B, resulting in 0.4 phages, but we saw 4 plumes, so higher than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site in B's culture is 40, and in K's culture is 4. Assuming that the integration is random, the expected number of recombinants in K would depend on the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is R, then the fraction of phages that integrate into the K mutation site would be R multiplied by the fraction that already integrated into B's site.\n\nWait, but in reality, the integration sites are independent unless recombination occurs. So the overall fraction of phages integrating into any site is R. Therefore, the expected number of phages integrating into K's site in B's culture would be (R / 100) * 40. We observed 4, so 4 = (R / 100)*40 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%. But none of the options go up to 25%. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant events + Number of parental events) / Total number of events \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events is the number that integrated into K's site. Since in B's culture, 40 phages integrated, and in K's culture, 4 did, assuming that the integration is independent except for recombination, the number of recombinants would be (R/100)*40, where R is the recombination frequency. But according to our observation, this equals 4. So:\n\n(R/100)*40 = 4 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%\n\nAgain, 25% is not one of the options. Wait, looking back at the options provided: F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc. So perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of phages that integrated into the K site is 4, while those that integrated into the B site is 40. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. This suggests that only 10% of the phages that integrated into B also integrated into K. Which would imply a very low recombination rate, possibly around 1%.\n\nBecause if recombination rate R is 1%, then the fraction integrating into K would be R*(fraction integrating into B). But since all phages are integrated once, the fraction integrating into K would be R * 1, because all phages integrated once. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the phages in B have already integrated into B, and the ones in K are the new ones.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that the number of recombinants (integrated into K) is (R/100)*40. And we know that the number of recombinants is 4. So:\n\n4 = (R/100)*40 \u2192 R = (4*100)/40 = 100/4 = 25%\n\nAgain, 25%. None of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The phages in B's culture had 40 successful infections, and in K's culture, 4. So the number of recombinants in K's culture is 4. If the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of recombinants in K's culture would be R multiplied by the number of phages that integrated into B's site. But since the phages integrate independently, the expected number is R * 40. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s the fraction of phages that integrate into the K site, which is R times the fraction that integrated into B's site. But since all phages integrate exactly once, the total fraction is R, so the number in K's culture would be R * 40. So:\n\n4 = R * 40 \u2192 R = 4/40 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nAh! So the recombination rate R is 10%, which corresponds to option D: 0.1 percent. Wait, but 10% is option C: 1.5 percent? No, 10% is not listed. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 1 percent\n\nB. 2 percent\n\nC. 1.5 percent\n\nD. 0.1 percent\n\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nSo 10% isn't directly listed, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check again:\n\nIf the number of recombinants in K's culture is 4, and this is equal to R * 40 (since 40 phages integrated in B's culture), then R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But none of the options have 10%. The closest is C: 1.5% or D: 0.1%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the numbers. The problem states that four plumes are found on K and four hundred on B. Wait, no: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So 4 on K, 40 on B. So 4 = R * 40 \u2192 R = 0.1, which is 10%. But 10% isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in the B culture integrate into the lysogenic site, and those in the K culture integrate into the mutation site. So the number of recombinants in K is the number of phages that integrated into K's site, which is 4. The total number of phages that could integrate is 40 (from B's culture). So the fraction is 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in the B culture are the ones that integrate into the lysogenic site, and the phages in the K culture are the ones that integrate into the mutation site. So the number of recombinants in K is 4, which is R times the number of phages in B's culture. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%, still not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the phages in B's culture include both lysogenic and mutated, but upon integration, only lysogenic remains. Then, the number of phages that successfully integrated into the lysogenic site is 40. Among these, 4 became mutants, and 36 remained as lysogenic. Wait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phage caused lysis in B, so the others didn't. So perhaps the 40 successful integrations included both the lysogenic and the mutant phages. But the mutant phages didn't cause lysis, so they died immediately, leaving only the lysogenic phages. Therefore, the number of lysogenic phages is 40, and the rest of the phages (from the B culture) must have been the mutant phages that didn't integrate successfully. But this complicates things further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows:\n\nTotal phages in B culture: All phages from both mutant and wild types. Upon integration, lysogenic phages remain, while the others die. So, in the B culture, the number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site is equal to the number of phages in the B culture minus the number that died due to mutation. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutant and wild-type phages are present, and the B culture is plated with a certain dilution, the number of phages that integrate into the lysogenic site (and thus survive) is proportional to the number of phages present in the B culture. Similarly, phages that integrate into the mutant site (and die) would leave behind the lysogenic phages. \n\nGiven that in the B culture, 40 phages integrated into the lysogenic site, and in the K culture, 4 did so. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. Assuming that the integration sites are distinct, the fraction of phages that integrate into the K site is 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, but that doesn't align with the previous calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombinant phages in K is 4, which is R multiplied by the number of phages that integrated into B's site. So R = 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Maybe the B culture had 40 phages integrate, and the K culture had 4. The recombination rate is calculated as 4 / (number of phages in B culture that could integrate). If the number of phages in B culture that could integrate is 40, then R = 4/40 = 0.1 or 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but 0.1 is much larger.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted the numbers. Perhaps the number of recombinants in K is 4, and the number of phages that could integrate in K is 40. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible, which would be 100%, so 10% would correspond to option C: 1.5%, which is closer than D: 0.1%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options and see which makes sense. If the number of recombinants in K is 4, and the total number of phages that could integrate in B's culture is 40, then the recombination rate is 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But the closest option is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, which is tenfold smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the reciprocal, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try again. The number of phages that integrated into the lysogenic site in B's culture is 40, and in K's culture, it's 4. The difference is 36. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of recombinants in K's culture is R multiplied by the number of phages in B's culture that could integrate. Assuming that all phages integrate exactly once, then R = 4 / 40 = 0.1 or 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that contradicts 0.1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the numbers. The problem states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So 40 phages integrated in B's culture, and 4 in K's. The ratio is 1:10. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of recombinants in K is R * (number of phages in B's culture). But the number of phages in B's culture that could integrate is 40. So R = 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant events + Number of parental events) / Total number of events \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events is 4 (in K), and the number of parental events is (40 - 4) = 36, assuming that the remaining phages didn't integrate into the lysogenic site. But I'm not sure if this is applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is simply the proportion of phages that integrated into the K site, which is 4 / 40 = 0.1 or 10%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001, but that's way off. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the direction of the phages' mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that interferes with integration, so when it integrates into the lysogenic site, it doesn't cause lysis. Thus, in B's culture,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So if you have 40 plumes on B, that means more infections occurred than on K, right?",
    "rollout": " So if you have 40 plumes on B, that means more infections occurred than on K, right?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about the probabilities. In a normal case without recombination, each mutation would independently cause an infection. But when they recombine, their effects might be additive. If recombination occurs, the probability of both mutations causing an infection would increase. Alternatively, if one mutation suppresses the other, like in lysogeny, then the combined effect could be different. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse E. coli strain B because it's lysogenic, so it would just replicate inside. But the lysogenic phage also doesn't lyse, so why did strain B get affected? Maybe because the lysogenic phage isn't present anymore? Or perhaps the presence of another phage type caused some instability. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the lysogenic phage does nothing to B, but the lytic phage (which is wild-type) does something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause thelysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\" So the lysogenic phage affects B but not K. That implies that the lysogenic phage has a mutation in its rII (genomic region) that allows it to lyse B, but not K. Because if it didn't affect K, it must lack that mutation. So the lysogenic phage's rII mutation is responsible for its ability to lyse B, while the wild-type lysogenic phage (without the mutation) doesn't do anything. Similarly, the lytic phage probably has a different mutation, but since it doesn't affect B, maybe the lytic phage's mutation is in a different region or not relevant here.\n\nNow, when both types of mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the combination leads to more infections than expected by chance alone. Normally, the number of infections from two independent events would follow a Poisson distribution. The observed count (plumes) can help estimate the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which tells us how likely we are seeing this outcome under different models (with or without recombination).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N = total number of plumes observed.\n- n1 = number of plumes from strain B.\n- n2 = number of plumes from strain K.\n\nBut wait, actually, when both types are mixed, each half is plated separately. So half (n1) is plated on strain B's lawn, expecting fewer infections because strain B is unaffected unless the lysogenic phage from the other half (n2) somehow interacts. Similarly, the other half (n2) is plated on strain K's lawn, which expects fewer infections because strain K is unaffected except due to the lysogenic phage from the first half (n1). However, in reality, both happen, leading to some cells being lysed twice, which makes the plumes cluster around certain areas.\n\nThe formula for LRT comparing the hypothesis of no recombination (H0) versus recombination (H1) is:\n\n\u03bb = (n1 + n2)! / (n1! * n2!) * e^-(n1 + n2)\n\nUnder H0, where there's no recombination, n1 and n2 are independent, so \u03bb0 = 1.\n\nUnder H1, where there's recombination, we calculate the maximum likelihood. The expected counts would depend on the mutation rates of each phage type. Since each phage has its own mutation rate, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the lytic phage, the expected number of plumes from each would be proportional to these rates.\n\nBut in this case, the problem simplifies things by giving specific numbers. We have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Assuming that each half is equally represented, the total plumes per half would be 40/2=20 on B and 4/2=2 on K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the half that's plated on K has 4 plumes, and the half on B has 40. So each half is plated individually, meaning the total plumes are 40 on B's half and 4 on K's half. Therefore, the expectation under H0 would be that each would have an equal number of plumes, assuming no recombination, but under H1, they might differ based on recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the formula for the probability of observing the number of plumes given the model. For example, under H0, the expected number of plumes on K would be (number of times the lysogenic phage infects K), and similarly for B. Under H1, the expectation depends on whether the mutations are linked or not.\n\nGiven the data:\n- On strain B's half: 40 plumes\n- On strain K's half: 4 plumes\n\nAssuming each half is equally likely to be any of the original plasmid types, the expected number of plumes on each half would be proportional to the mutation rates. But without knowing the exact mutation rates, it's tricky. Instead, perhaps we can use the formula for the probability of observing the number of plumes under the assumption of no recombination versus recombination.\n\nThe key idea is that under recombination, the number of plumes observed will be higher because the mutations influence the replication efficiency differently depending on the host. Without recombination, the number would be lower because the mutations don't interact, leading to less clonal expansion.\n\nUsing the formula, the probability of observing k plumes under H0 and H1 can be compared using the likelihood ratio. The value of ln(\u03bb) gives an indication of how much better the observed data fits H1 over H0.\n\nIn this case, the observed counts are significantly higher on B (40 vs. 4). To quantify the recombination, we can compute the likelihood ratio and compare it against the critical value for a significance level (like alpha=0.05). If the log-likelihood ratio exceeds the critical value, we conclude that recombination is significant.\n\nHowever, instead of going through all the calculations, I recall that the formula often used is:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 - \u03bc1)(n2 - \u03bc2) - (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2)^2\n\nWhere \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the expected values under H0. Under H0, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (n1 + n2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\nn1 = 40, n2 = 4\n\n\u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (40 + 4)/2 = 22\n\nThen,\n\nln(\u03bb) = (40 - 22)(4 - 22) - (22 + 22)^2\n       = (18)(-18) - (44)^2\n       = -324 - 1936\n       = -2260\n\nThis is a very large negative number, indicating a strong fit to H0. But we want to see if the fit is significantly worse under H1.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is sometimes presented as:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 * n2) - (\u03bc1 * \u03bc2)\n\nWhich would give:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (40*4) - (22*22)\n       = 160 - 484\n       = -324\n\nAgain, a large negative number, suggesting strong support for H0.\n\nWait, but I think the correct formula uses the product terms. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 + n2) * (log(n1) + log(n2)) - n1*log(n1) - n2*log(n2) - [log((n1 + n2)!/(n1!n2!))]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider the chi-squared statistic.\n\nThe chi-squared statistic is:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = 2[ (n1 * n2) - (n1 + n2)(e^{-k}) ]\n\nBut I'm getting tangled up. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage's mutation is in strain B and affects it, while the other phage doesn't affect B. When both are present, the total number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K.\n\nIf there was no recombination, we'd expect the same number of plumes on both strains. Here, 40 vs. 4, which is a factor of 10 difference. Logically, a factor of 10 difference would suggest some form of recombination, as it indicates a change in the replication mechanism affecting both strains.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula involving the natural logarithm:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 - \u03bc1)(n2 - \u03bc2) - (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2)^2\n\nBut I'm still not confident. Alternatively, the formula can be expressed as:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 * n2) - (\u03bc1 * \u03bc2)\n\nWhich gives the log-likelihood ratio.\n\nWe know that under H0, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (n1 + n2)/2 = 22.\n\nThus, ln(\u03bb) = 40*4 - 22*22 = 160 - 484 = -324.\n\nThe critical value for a chi-squared test at \u03b1=0.05 with degrees of freedom 1 is about 3.84. Since our |ln(\u03bb)| is way larger than 3.84, we can reject H0, concluding significant recombination.\n\nBut what does this mean in terms of recombination frequency (RF)? RF measures the proportion of recombined alleles. However, in this context, the recombination refers to the mutation in the phage's DNA causing a change in replication efficiency.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. It seems like the recombination refers to the mutation in the phage's genome. However, phages typically don't recombine; they pass on their genetic material. But in this scenario, the mutation in the phage's rII region affects its replication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the fraction of time or occurrence of recombination between the two mutations. But I'm not entirely clear on that.\n\nWait, looking back, the answer choices are percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. Given that the recombination frequency is high\u201440 vs. 4\u2014this suggests that recombination is quite common. But without calculating the exact value, it's hard to tell exactly what percentage.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is related to the probability of recombination. The formula for the expected number of plumes under recombination is:\n\nE = (n1 + n2) * (p + q)\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of the two mutations occurring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the variance in plume counts can indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that the variance is higher when there is recombination, we can infer that recombination is significant. But converting this into a percentage requires some calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers: 40 on B and 4 on K. The total plumes are 44. Each half is 22 plumes. So if there was complete linkage, each plume would represent a unique event. With recombination, the plumes would be shared between the two strains, leading to a reduction in the overall count.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that most of the plumes originated from B, implying that recombination occurred frequently enough to favor B's plumes. The exact percentage would require applying the recombination formula, which I think is:\n\np = (ln(\u03bb)) / (2 * \u03c7\u00b2)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is used in molecular biology to measure the degree of covalent modification, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nAnother thought: The ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. The expected ratio under no recombination would be 1:1, but under recombination, it would deviate. The ratio of 10:1 is quite far from 1:1, indicating significant recombination.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\n rf = (p + q)/(p*q)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence is COI = (O12 / (E12))^(1/2) - 1, where O12 is observed, E12 is expected, etc. But without specific values, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the likelihood ratio test for linkage disequilibrium:\n\nD = (n1*n2 - n1*n2) / (n1 + n2)\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t seem right. Alternatively, the formula for D is:\n\nD = (n1*n2) / (n1 + n2)\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nI think I need to proceed with the initial approach. The key point is that the number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K, indicating significant recombination. The exact percentage needs to be computed, but without the formula, it's challenging.\n\nHowever, considering the options provided, 2% seems plausible, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, 1% or 0.1% are possible. But given that the ratio is 10:1, which is a significant deviation from 1:1, the recombination frequency is likely above 1%.\n\nLooking at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, C is 1.5%, etc., with A being 1%. Since the ratio is 10:1, which is closer to a 1:1 ratio than 1:10, the recombination frequency would be somewhere around 1-2%.\n\nTherefore, among the options, B is 2%, which seems reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have 40 plumes on B, that means more infections occurred than on K, right?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about the probabilities. In a normal case without recombination, each mutation would independently cause an infection. But when they recombine, their effects might be additive. If recombination occurs, the probability of both mutations causing an infection would increase. Alternatively, if one mutation suppresses the other, like in lysogeny, then the combined effect could be different. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse E. coli strain B because it's lysogenic, so it would just replicate inside. But the lysogenic phage also doesn't lyse, so why did strain B get affected? Maybe because the lysogenic phage isn't present anymore? Or perhaps the presence of another phage type caused some instability. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that the lysogenic phage does nothing to B, but the lytic phage (which is wild-type) does something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause thelysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\" So the lysogenic phage affects B but not K. That implies that the lysogenic phage has a mutation in its rII (genomic region) that allows it to lyse B, but not K. Because if it didn't affect K, it must lack that mutation. So the lysogenic phage's rII mutation is responsible for its ability to lyse B, while the wild-type lysogenic phage (without the mutation) doesn't do anything. Similarly, the lytic phage probably has a different mutation, but since it doesn't affect B, maybe the lytic phage's mutation is in a different region or not relevant here.\n\nNow, when both types of mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the combination leads to more infections than expected by chance alone. Normally, the number of infections from two independent events would follow a Poisson distribution. The observed count (plumes) can help estimate the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which tells us how likely we are seeing this outcome under different models (with or without recombination).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N = total number of plumes observed.\n- n1 = number of plumes from strain B.\n- n2 = number of plumes from strain K.\n\nBut wait, actually, when both types are mixed, each half is plated separately. So half (n1) is plated on strain B's lawn, expecting fewer infections because strain B is unaffected unless the lysogenic phage from the other half (n2) somehow interacts. Similarly, the other half (n2) is plated on strain K's lawn, which expects fewer infections because strain K is unaffected except due to the lysogenic phage from the first half (n1). However, in reality, both happen, leading to some cells being lysed twice, which makes the plumes cluster around certain areas.\n\nThe formula for LRT comparing the hypothesis of no recombination (H0) versus recombination (H1) is:\n\n\u03bb = (n1 + n2)! / (n1! * n2!) * e^-(n1 + n2)\n\nUnder H0, where there's no recombination, n1 and n2 are independent, so \u03bb0 = 1.\n\nUnder H1, where there's recombination, we calculate the maximum likelihood. The expected counts would depend on the mutation rates of each phage type. Since each phage has its own mutation rate, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the lytic phage, the expected number of plumes from each would be proportional to these rates.\n\nBut in this case, the problem simplifies things by giving specific numbers. We have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Assuming that each half is equally represented, the total plumes per half would be 40/2=20 on B and 4/2=2 on K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the half that's plated on K has 4 plumes, and the half on B has 40. So each half is plated individually, meaning the total plumes are 40 on B's half and 4 on K's half. Therefore, the expectation under H0 would be that each would have an equal number of plumes, assuming no recombination, but under H1, they might differ based on recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the formula for the probability of observing the number of plumes given the model. For example, under H0, the expected number of plumes on K would be (number of times the lysogenic phage infects K), and similarly for B. Under H1, the expectation depends on whether the mutations are linked or not.\n\nGiven the data:\n- On strain B's half: 40 plumes\n- On strain K's half: 4 plumes\n\nAssuming each half is equally likely to be any of the original plasmid types, the expected number of plumes on each half would be proportional to the mutation rates. But without knowing the exact mutation rates, it's tricky. Instead, perhaps we can use the formula for the probability of observing the number of plumes under the assumption of no recombination versus recombination.\n\nThe key idea is that under recombination, the number of plumes observed will be higher because the mutations influence the replication efficiency differently depending on the host. Without recombination, the number would be lower because the mutations don't interact, leading to less clonal expansion.\n\nUsing the formula, the probability of observing k plumes under H0 and H1 can be compared using the likelihood ratio. The value of ln(\u03bb) gives an indication of how much better the observed data fits H1 over H0.\n\nIn this case, the observed counts are significantly higher on B (40 vs. 4). To quantify the recombination, we can compute the likelihood ratio and compare it against the critical value for a significance level (like alpha=0.05). If the log-likelihood ratio exceeds the critical value, we conclude that recombination is significant.\n\nHowever, instead of going through all the calculations, I recall that the formula often used is:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 - \u03bc1)(n2 - \u03bc2) - (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2)^2\n\nWhere \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the expected values under H0. Under H0, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (n1 + n2)/2.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\nn1 = 40, n2 = 4\n\n\u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (40 + 4)/2 = 22\n\nThen,\n\nln(\u03bb) = (40 - 22)(4 - 22) - (22 + 22)^2\n       = (18)(-18) - (44)^2\n       = -324 - 1936\n       = -2260\n\nThis is a very large negative number, indicating a strong fit to H0. But we want to see if the fit is significantly worse under H1.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is sometimes presented as:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 * n2) - (\u03bc1 * \u03bc2)\n\nWhich would give:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (40*4) - (22*22)\n       = 160 - 484\n       = -324\n\nAgain, a large negative number, suggesting strong support for H0.\n\nWait, but I think the correct formula uses the product terms. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 + n2) * (log(n1) + log(n2)) - n1*log(n1) - n2*log(n2) - [log((n1 + n2)!/(n1!n2!))]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider the chi-squared statistic.\n\nThe chi-squared statistic is:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = 2[ (n1 * n2) - (n1 + n2)(e^{-k}) ]\n\nBut I'm getting tangled up. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage's mutation is in strain B and affects it, while the other phage doesn't affect B. When both are present, the total number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K.\n\nIf there was no recombination, we'd expect the same number of plumes on both strains. Here, 40 vs. 4, which is a factor of 10 difference. Logically, a factor of 10 difference would suggest some form of recombination, as it indicates a change in the replication mechanism affecting both strains.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula involving the natural logarithm:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 - \u03bc1)(n2 - \u03bc2) - (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2)^2\n\nBut I'm still not confident. Alternatively, the formula can be expressed as:\n\nln(\u03bb) = (n1 * n2) - (\u03bc1 * \u03bc2)\n\nWhich gives the log-likelihood ratio.\n\nWe know that under H0, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = (n1 + n2)/2 = 22.\n\nThus, ln(\u03bb) = 40*4 - 22*22 = 160 - 484 = -324.\n\nThe critical value for a chi-squared test at \u03b1=0.05 with degrees of freedom 1 is about 3.84. Since our |ln(\u03bb)| is way larger than 3.84, we can reject H0, concluding significant recombination.\n\nBut what does this mean in terms of recombination frequency (RF)? RF measures the proportion of recombined alleles. However, in this context, the recombination refers to the mutation in the phage's DNA causing a change in replication efficiency.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. It seems like the recombination refers to the mutation in the phage's genome. However, phages typically don't recombine; they pass on their genetic material. But in this scenario, the mutation in the phage's rII region affects its replication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the fraction of time or occurrence of recombination between the two mutations. But I'm not entirely clear on that.\n\nWait, looking back, the answer choices are percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. Given that the recombination frequency is high\u201440 vs. 4\u2014this suggests that recombination is quite common. But without calculating the exact value, it's hard to tell exactly what percentage.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to recognize that the number of plumes is related to the probability of recombination. The formula for the expected number of plumes under recombination is:\n\nE = (n1 + n2) * (p + q)\n\nWhere p and q are the probabilities of the two mutations occurring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the variance in plume counts can indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that the variance is higher when there is recombination, we can infer that recombination is significant. But converting this into a percentage requires some calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers: 40 on B and 4 on K. The total plumes are 44. Each half is 22 plumes. So if there was complete linkage, each plume would represent a unique event. With recombination, the plumes would be shared between the two strains, leading to a reduction in the overall count.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that most of the plumes originated from B, implying that recombination occurred frequently enough to favor B's plumes. The exact percentage would require applying the recombination formula, which I think is:\n\np = (ln(\u03bb)) / (2 * \u03c7\u00b2)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is used in molecular biology to measure the degree of covalent modification, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nAnother thought: The ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. The expected ratio under no recombination would be 1:1, but under recombination, it would deviate. The ratio of 10:1 is quite far from 1:1, indicating significant recombination.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as:\n\n rf = (p + q)/(p*q)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence is COI = (O12 / (E12))^(1/2) - 1, where O12 is observed, E12 is expected, etc. But without specific values, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the likelihood ratio test for linkage disequilibrium:\n\nD = (n1*n2 - n1*n2) / (n1 + n2)\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t seem right. Alternatively, the formula for D is:\n\nD = (n1*n2) / (n1 + n2)\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nI think I need to proceed with the initial approach. The key point is that the number of plumes is 40 on B and 4 on K, indicating significant recombination. The exact percentage needs to be computed, but without the formula, it's challenging.\n\nHowever, considering the options provided, 2% seems plausible, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, 1% or 0.1% are possible. But given that the ratio is 10:1, which is a significant deviation from 1:1, the recombination frequency is likely above 1%.\n\nLooking at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, C is 1.5%, etc., with A being 1%. Since the ratio is 10:1, which is closer to a 1:1 ratio than 1:10, the recombination frequency would be somewhere around 1-2%.\n\nTherefore, among the options, B is 2%, which seems reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "rollout": " So if there are 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, that means 40 phages have already taken over the cells. Similarly, 4 on strain K's lawn mean 4 phages have taken over there.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates how many successful infections occurred. Since the phages are placed on different bacterial strains, their interactions might affect the outcome. The presence of 4 plumes on strain K suggests that only 4 phages from the lysogenic type successfully integrated into strain B's genome. On the other hand, 40 plumes on strain B indicate that more phages were able to integrate into its genome, including those from the lysogenic phage that caused lytic fission. \n\nNow, the goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material during replication, leading to new combinations. In the context of phages, this would involve the integration of the lysogenic and lytic phage genes into the T_4 genome. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, while the lytic one isn't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage may be integrating into the T_4 genome, possibly through recombination, allowing it to replicate without lysis. Alternatively, perhaps the lytic phage is causing issues, indicating that the T_4 phage is replicating without proper integration, leading to lysis.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis if it integrates properly. So maybe the presence of lysogenic phages causing problems implies that the T_4 genome has regions where integration is occurring, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate without lysis. That would suggest that the T_4 genome has undergone some form of recombination, such as double-strand break repair or integration, allowing the lysogenic gene to take root and replicate without being recognized for lysis.\n\nLooking at the numbers, on strain B's lawn, 40 phages have already integrated, meaning about 60% of the phages in that population integrated. On strain K's lawn, only 4 phages integrated. If we consider that the same recombination process occurs in both bacteria, then the proportion of recombinants should be similar. However, the ratio here is quite different\u201460% versus 4%. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the environment or the efficiency of recombination.\n\nBut wait, the actual calculation for recombination frequency typically uses the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But in this case, perhaps the observed rates can help us estimate the probability of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of successful infections depends on the recombination rate. If recombination leads to the lysogenic gene taking root, then the integration would reduce the chance of lysis. So if the lysogenic phage integrates into the T_4 genome, it won't lyse the cell, thus surviving and potentially infecting others. Therefore, the higher the recombination rate, the fewer successful infections (since more phages don't lyse), leading to fewer plumes on the B strain.\n\nIn our case, on strain B, 40 plumes, implying 60% integration; on strain K, 4 plumes, 80% integration? Wait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. If the recombination increases, you'd expect more integration, leading to more survival and less plumes. Here, 60% on B vs. 80% on K\u2014it\u2019s the opposite. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. If recombination reduces the chance of lysis, then more phages survive and infect. So if the lysogenic phage integrates, it takes over the T_4 genome without lysis, so it wouldn\u2019t lyse the cells. Therefore, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive and infect, leading to fewer plumes on the host.\n\nSo in our data, on strain B, which is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, there are fewer plumes (40) than on strain K (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If recombination happens, more phages survive, so more plumes on the host. Conversely, if there's no recombination, fewer phages survive, fewer plumes on the host.\n\nHere, strain B is mainly affected, meaning more phages are taking over, which would imply less recombination. Strain K is less affected, meaning fewer phages are taking over, suggesting more recombination.\n\nBut according to the data, strain B has 40 plumes, which is much lower than the 4 plumes on strain K. That suggests more integration on strain K, which contradicts my previous thought. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of successful integrations. So if recombination occurs, more phages will integrate into the T_4 genome, reducing the likelihood of lysis. Thus, more successful infections occur on the host, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both types are present. So when they mix, the host is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage. The presence of both phages might lead to some level of competition, but in terms of recombination, perhaps the integration of the lysogenic phage is what matters.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the recombination frequency. Suppose the number of successful integrations is proportional to the number of plumes. So on strain B, 40 plumes correspond to 40% integration, and on strain K, 4 plumes correspond to 4% integration. But that doesn't align with the idea that recombination affects both equally. Maybe the integration rate is the same, but the presence of the lysogenic phage changes things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, increasing the chances of it taking over without lysis. Therefore, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of surviving and infecting, resulting in more plumes on the host.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of plumes would increase based on R. But given the data, the number of plumes is inversely related to the recombination rate. Because more integration leads to fewer plumes.\n\nTo model this, suppose the number of successful integrations S is related to the recombination frequency R by S = N * (1 - R), where N is the total number of phages. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is R, then the fraction of phages that have successfully integrated is R. Therefore, the number of successful integrations per phage is R. So the total number of successful integrations across all phages would be (N_total) * R.\n\nBut in our case, the total number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful integrations. So if strain B had 40 plumes, that would correspond to 40 successful integrations, and strain K has 4, corresponding to 4 successful integrations. Therefore, the ratio of successful integrations is 40:4, or 10:1. That suggests that the integration rate is ten times higher on strain K compared to strain B.\n\nThis suggests that recombination occurred significantly more often on strain K, which makes sense if the lysogenic phage was able to integrate better or was more efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allowed the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, making it more likely for the lysogenic phage to take root and replicate without lysis.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate R can be estimated based on the difference in successful integrations. The ratio of successful integrations is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that the number of phages is the same on both plates, the ratio of successful integrations is equal to the ratio of recombination success. So R_K / R_B = 10. But since we're asked for the recombination between the two mutations, perhaps it's the difference between the two rates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated using the formula:\n\nR = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nwhere p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. However, in this case, p and q are the fractions of the phages that have successfully integrated. So p = 40/N and q = 4/N, assuming N is the total number of phages.\n\nThen R = 1 - (1 - 40/N)(1 - 4/N)\n\nExpanding this:\n\nR = 1 - [1 - 40/N - 4/N + 16/(N^2)]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nR = 1 - 1 + 40/N + 4/N - 16/(N^2)\nR = (44)/N - 16/(N^2)\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to compute R directly. However, if we assume that the number of successful integrations is approximately equal to the recombination frequency multiplied by the total phages, then R \u2248 (40 + 4)/N = 44/N.\n\nBut without knowing N, we can't find R numerically. However, perhaps the question assumes that the recombination rate is the difference between the two successful integration rates.\n\nThat is, R = (40 - 4)/N = 36/N. But again, without N, we can't get R. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to recognize that the recombination rate is the percentage of the lysogenic phage that successfully integrated into the T_4 genome.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is responsible for the problem in strain B, and it didn't lyse, the majority of its copies must have integrated into the T_4 genome. Therefore, the percentage of recombination would be high. Looking at the options, C is 1.5%, D is 0.1%, etc. If 40% of the lysogenic phages integrated, that's a lot, but perhaps more accurately, the recombination rate is the percentage of phages that took up the T_4 genome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of successful integrations is proportional to the recombination frequency. Since 40% of the lysogenic phages integrated, that would be the recombination frequency. But none of the options match exactly, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another angle: The presence of the lysogenic phage allows the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, thereby increasing the chance of the lysogenic phage taking over without lysis. The degree of recombination would determine how effective this is. If the recombination rate is high, more plumes appear on the host.\n\nGiven that strain B shows 40 plumes and strain K shows 4, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination is R, then the successful integrations are proportional to R. Therefore, R_K / R_B = 10. But unless we know either R or the total number of phages, we can't determine R.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, the highest recombination rate is 5%, followed by 3%. Given that the ratio is 10, which corresponds to a significant recombination, perhaps around 2-3%, which is option F (0.3%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of phages that successfully integrated. If on strain B, 40% integrated, and on strain K, 4% integrated, the difference is 36%, but that's not matching any option.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is based on the fact that the presence of both types leads to a situation where the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of integrating, leading to more plumes on the host. The exact value would depend on the recombination rate, which isn't provided, so perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination rate is high enough to explain the higher number of plumes on strain B relative to strain K, which is option F (0.3%).\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to look at it is that the number of successful integrations is proportional to the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of successful integrations is R*N. Therefore, the ratio of successful integrations on K to B is (R_K / R_B) = 40/4 = 10. So R_K = 10*R_B. But since R cannot exceed 100%, this suggests that the recombination rate on K is significantly higher than on B, but without knowing R_B, we can't find R_K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. The presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B explains why it has more plumes. The lysogenic phage hasn't been replicated yet, so it can replicate without lysis. The presence of the lytic phage on strain K probably just kills the cells, so no plumes are formed there. The recombination between the two mutations would allow the lysogenic phage to integrate into the T_4 genome, making it more likely to survive and replicate without lysis.\n\nThe exact percentage isn't clear, but among the options, 0.3% (option F) seems plausible if the recombination is moderate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

On the other hand, 40 plumes on strain B indicate that more phages were able to integrate into its genome, including those from the lysogenic phage that caused lytic fission. \n\nNow, the goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material during replication, leading to new combinations. In the context of phages, this would involve the integration of the lysogenic and lytic phage genes into the T_4 genome. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, while the lytic one isn't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage may be integrating into the T_4 genome, possibly through recombination, allowing it to replicate without lysis. Alternatively, perhaps the lytic phage is causing issues, indicating that the T_4 phage is replicating without proper integration, leading to lysis.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis if it integrates properly. So maybe the presence of lysogenic phages causing problems implies that the T_4 genome has regions where integration is occurring, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate without lysis. That would suggest that the T_4 genome has undergone some form of recombination, such as double-strand break repair or integration, allowing the lysogenic gene to take root and replicate without being recognized for lysis.\n\nLooking at the numbers, on strain B's lawn, 40 phages have already integrated, meaning about 60% of the phages in that population integrated. On strain K's lawn, only 4 phages integrated. If we consider that the same recombination process occurs in both bacteria, then the proportion of recombinants should be similar. However, the ratio here is quite different\u201460% versus 4%. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the environment or the efficiency of recombination.\n\nBut wait, the actual calculation for recombination frequency typically uses the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But in this case, perhaps the observed rates can help us estimate the probability of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of successful infections depends on the recombination rate. If recombination leads to the lysogenic gene taking root, then the integration would reduce the chance of lysis. So if the lysogenic phage integrates into the T_4 genome, it won't lyse the cell, thus surviving and potentially infecting others. Therefore, the higher the recombination rate, the fewer successful infections (since more phages don't lyse), leading to fewer plumes on the B strain.\n\nIn our case, on strain B, 40 plumes, implying 60% integration; on strain K, 4 plumes, 80% integration? Wait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. If the recombination increases, you'd expect more integration, leading to more survival and less plumes. Here, 60% on B vs. 80% on K\u2014it\u2019s the opposite. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. If recombination reduces the chance of lysis, then more phages survive and infect. So if the lysogenic phage integrates, it takes over the T_4 genome without lysis, so it wouldn\u2019t lyse the cells. Therefore, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive and infect, leading to fewer plumes on the host.\n\nSo in our data, on strain B, which is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, there are fewer plumes (40) than on strain K (4). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If recombination happens, more phages survive, so more plumes on the host. Conversely, if there's no recombination, fewer phages survive, fewer plumes on the host.\n\nHere, strain B is mainly affected, meaning more phages are taking over, which would imply less recombination. Strain K is less affected, meaning fewer phages are taking over, suggesting more recombination.\n\nBut according to the data, strain B has 40 plumes, which is much lower than the 4 plumes on strain K. That suggests more integration on strain K, which contradicts my previous thought. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of successful integrations. So if recombination occurs, more phages will integrate into the T_4 genome, reducing the likelihood of lysis. Thus, more successful infections occur on the host, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, but the problem states that both types are present. So when they mix, the host is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage. The presence of both phages might lead to some level of competition, but in terms of recombination, perhaps the integration of the lysogenic phage is what matters.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the recombination frequency. Suppose the number of successful integrations is proportional to the number of plumes. So on strain B, 40 plumes correspond to 40% integration, and on strain K, 4 plumes correspond to 4% integration. But that doesn't align with the idea that recombination affects both equally. Maybe the integration rate is the same, but the presence of the lysogenic phage changes things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, increasing the chances of it taking over without lysis. Therefore, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of surviving and infecting, resulting in more plumes on the host.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of plumes would increase based on R. But given the data, the number of plumes is inversely related to the recombination rate. Because more integration leads to fewer plumes.\n\nTo model this, suppose the number of successful integrations S is related to the recombination frequency R by S = N * (1 - R), where N is the total number of phages. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is R, then the fraction of phages that have successfully integrated is R. Therefore, the number of successful integrations per phage is R. So the total number of successful integrations across all phages would be (N_total) * R.\n\nBut in our case, the total number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful integrations. So if strain B had 40 plumes, that would correspond to 40 successful integrations, and strain K has 4, corresponding to 4 successful integrations. Therefore, the ratio of successful integrations is 40:4, or 10:1. That suggests that the integration rate is ten times higher on strain K compared to strain B.\n\nThis suggests that recombination occurred significantly more often on strain K, which makes sense if the lysogenic phage was able to integrate better or was more efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allowed the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, making it more likely for the lysogenic phage to take root and replicate without lysis.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate R can be estimated based on the difference in successful integrations. The ratio of successful integrations is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that the number of phages is the same on both plates, the ratio of successful integrations is equal to the ratio of recombination success. So R_K / R_B = 10. But since we're asked for the recombination between the two mutations, perhaps it's the difference between the two rates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated using the formula:\n\nR = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nwhere p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. However, in this case, p and q are the fractions of the phages that have successfully integrated. So p = 40/N and q = 4/N, assuming N is the total number of phages.\n\nThen R = 1 - (1 - 40/N)(1 - 4/N)\n\nExpanding this:\n\nR = 1 - [1 - 40/N - 4/N + 16/(N^2)]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nR = 1 - 1 + 40/N + 4/N - 16/(N^2)\nR = (44)/N - 16/(N^2)\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to compute R directly. However, if we assume that the number of successful integrations is approximately equal to the recombination frequency multiplied by the total phages, then R \u2248 (40 + 4)/N = 44/N.\n\nBut without knowing N, we can't find R numerically. However, perhaps the question assumes that the recombination rate is the difference between the two successful integration rates.\n\nThat is, R = (40 - 4)/N = 36/N. But again, without N, we can't get R. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to recognize that the recombination rate is the percentage of the lysogenic phage that successfully integrated into the T_4 genome.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is responsible for the problem in strain B, and it didn't lyse, the majority of its copies must have integrated into the T_4 genome. Therefore, the percentage of recombination would be high. Looking at the options, C is 1.5%, D is 0.1%, etc. If 40% of the lysogenic phages integrated, that's a lot, but perhaps more accurately, the recombination rate is the percentage of phages that took up the T_4 genome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of successful integrations is proportional to the recombination frequency. Since 40% of the lysogenic phages integrated, that would be the recombination frequency. But none of the options match exactly, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another angle: The presence of the lysogenic phage allows the T_4 genome to undergo recombination, thereby increasing the chance of the lysogenic phage taking over without lysis. The degree of recombination would determine how effective this is. If the recombination rate is high, more plumes appear on the host.\n\nGiven that strain B shows 40 plumes and strain K shows 4, the ratio is 10:1. If recombination is R, then the successful integrations are proportional to R. Therefore, R_K / R_B = 10. But unless we know either R or the total number of phages, we can't determine R.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, the highest recombination rate is 5%, followed by 3%. Given that the ratio is 10, which corresponds to a significant recombination, perhaps around 2-3%, which is option F (0.3%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of phages that successfully integrated. If on strain B, 40% integrated, and on strain K, 4% integrated, the difference is 36%, but that's not matching any option.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is based on the fact that the presence of both types leads to a situation where the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of integrating, leading to more plumes on the host. The exact value would depend on the recombination rate, which isn't provided, so perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination rate is high enough to explain the higher number of plumes on strain B relative to strain K, which is option F (0.3%).\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to look at it is that the number of successful integrations is proportional to the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of successful integrations is R*N. Therefore, the ratio of successful integrations on K to B is (R_K / R_B) = 40/4 = 10. So R_K = 10*R_B. But since R cannot exceed 100%, this suggests that the recombination rate on K is significantly higher than on B, but without knowing R_B, we can't find R_K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. The presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B explains why it has more plumes. The lysogenic phage hasn't been replicated yet, so it can replicate without lysis. The presence of the lytic phage on strain K probably just kills the cells, so no plumes are formed there. The recombination between the two mutations would allow the lysogenic phage to integrate into the T_4 genome, making it more likely to survive and replicate without lysis.\n\nThe exact percentage isn't clear, but among the options, 0.3% (option F) seems plausible if the recombination is moderate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Similarly, for B, 40 plumes indicate 40 infections. \n\nNow, I remember that when two genes recombine, the probability of independent assortment decreases because of the crossing over. However, in phage titration experiments, the number of recombinants depends on how much they have combined. If the two mutations are tightly linked, their occurrence would be more dependent on where they occurred along the chromosome. Each mutation has a certain frequency, and when they recombine, you get double the frequency of either mutation. \n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the total frequency of each type (mutant A, mutant B, and recombinant AB) would just add up. For example, if the frequency of mutant A is p and mutant B is q, without recombination, the frequency of AB would be pq. But here, we're seeing more than expected, especially since only a small fraction (4 out of 40) shows up on strain K. That suggests that the two mutations must have recombined significantly. \n\nThe formula I recall relates the number of recombinant colonies to the product of the frequencies of the two parental alleles. Specifically, the number of recombinants R is approximately equal to 2pq, assuming no interference and random assortment. In this case, the number of recombinant plumes is 4, while the total number of plumes is 44 (40 on B + 4 on K). So R = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Therefore, 0.0909 \u2248 2pq. \n\nAssuming each mutation occurs at a certain frequency, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the lytic phage. Since the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause damage, let's assume p > q. Without knowing exact frequencies, perhaps we can infer from the ratio. If 0.0909 \u2248 2pq, and considering that the mutations are separate, maybe p \u2248 q, making pq very small. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each mutation occurs once per phage, so the total number of each type of phage is proportional to their original frequencies. \n\nWait, another approach: if the two mutations are linked, the chance that a phage carrying both mutations (recombinant) will infect is higher. The observed number of recombinant plumes should be higher than what would be expected under independent assortment. Here, only 4 out of 44, which is roughly 9%, seems high. If they were completely linked, the recombinant rate would be lower, possibly around 5-10%. So 9% is quite high, suggesting significant recombination. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can calculate how many times the two mutations have swapped. Since each mutation contributes to the overall arrangement, the percentage of recombination could be calculated as (R / (p + q)) * 100. But without exact values for p and q, this might be tricky. Another way is to consider that if R = 2pq, then rearranging gives pq = R/(2). Assuming R is 4, pq = 4/2=2. But since p and q are fractions less than 1, their product being 2 isn't possible. This indicates my initial assumption might be wrong. Perhaps instead, R = 2pq, so 4/44 \u2248 2pq => pq \u2248 0.1818. If we take p \u2248 q, then p\u00b2 \u2248 0.1818 => p \u2248 sqrt(0.1818) \u2248 0.426. So each mutation has a frequency of about 42.6%, leading to pq \u2248 0.426*0.426\u22480.1818, which matches. Then, the percentage of recombination would be (2pq)/100% \u2248 (2*0.1818)*100%\u224836.36%. Wait, that's way too high. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nAnother thought: the number of recombinants R is approximately equal to 2pq/(p+q) * N, where N is the total population. But without knowing N, it's hard to apply directly. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is R = 2pq*(number of cells or plasmids plated). Wait, in this case, each plume corresponds to a single phage infection. So if R = 4, and the total plasmids are 44, then R = 4/44 * (total plasmids). Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the recombination increases the likelihood of both mutations occurring together, the number of recombinant plumes should be higher. The observed number is 4, which is 9% of 44. If the maximum possible would be 2pq, then 4 = 2pq => pq = 2. But p and q can\u2019t exceed 1, so this doesn\u2019t hold. Maybe the actual calculation is simpler. \n\nPerhaps the key point is that the presence of 4 recombinant plumes out of 44 suggests that the two mutations have recombined significantly. To estimate the percentage of recombination, we can use the fact that the observed number of recombinants (R) is approximately equal to 2pq*N, where N is the number of phages plated. But without knowing N, perhaps we can relate the relative numbers. Alternatively, if the two mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinants would be higher than if they were independent. Given that only 4 out of 44 showed recombination, this suggests a relatively high level of recombination. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, the percentages given suggest that the recombination is minimal, ranging from 0.02% to 5%. The high number of recombinant plumes (4 out of 44) suggests that the two mutations are highly related. Even though the exact calculation requires knowing the individual frequencies, a high number like 9% strongly points towards significant recombination. Among the options, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, and others are smaller. Since 9% is closer to 5%, option H (5%) seems plausible. Alternatively, if the calculation leads to exactly 9%, but none of the options match, perhaps the closest answer is H. But wait, the calculation led to pq\u22480.1818, implying a recombination rate of ~36%, which is way off. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me look up the phage titration method. In phage titration experiments, the number of recombinant colonies (R) is estimated using R \u2248 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the two parental alleles. The total number of plasmids (or phages) is N. So R = 2pqN. Rearranging, pq = R/N. If N is large, pq is small. If N is small, pq could be larger. But in our case, N is 44, so pq \u2248 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Taking square root, p \u2248 q \u2248 0.3. So each mutation has a frequency of about 30%. Then, recombination rate would be 2pq \u2248 2*0.3*0.3=0.18, or 18%, which still doesn't align with any of the options. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, it says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the dilution factors are 1:10^5 vs. 1:10^7. Dilutions affect the concentration of the phage in the media. Higher dilution means fewer phages are present per unit volume. \n\nIn phage titration, the number of recombinant colonies is used to determine the map units between two loci. The formula is R = 2pq, where p and q are the allele frequencies. However, if the two mutations are close together, the actual frequency of each mutation may be slightly higher due to the linkage effect. \n\nGiven that only 4 out of 44 colonies are recombinants, this suggests that the two mutations are quite closely linked. The percentage of recombination can be estimated by comparing the observed number of recombinants to the expected number if they were independent. If R_observed / R_expected = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, then the recombination rate is higher than expected for independent assortment. \n\nIf the mutations are nearly linked, the recombination rate could be as high as 50%. But the options don't go that high. The highest option is G (0.5%), followed by H (5%). Since 9% is closer to 5%, perhaps the answer is H. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is more straightforward. \n\nAnother approach: the number of recombinant plumes (R) is approximately equal to twice the product of the frequencies of the two mutations (R \u2248 2pq). If R is 4, and the total number of plasmids plated is 44, then pq \u2248 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Assuming each mutation is equally frequent (p=q), then p\u00b2 \u2248 0.0909 => p \u2248 0.3015. So each mutation occurs about 30% of the time. Then, the recombination rate would be 2pq \u2248 2*0.3015*0.3015\u22480.182, or 18%. But again, this doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula accounts for the dilution. Since one half is diluted 1:10^7 and the other 1:10^5, the effective concentrations differ. The number of phages available for each half is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So the first half has 10^7 phages per mL, and the second has 10^5 phages per mL. \n\nWhen you plate a certain number of cells, the number of phages available is proportional to the dilution factor. So the number of phages available for the first half is 10^7, and for the second half, it's 10^5. If the number of phages per colony is constant, then the number of recombinants should scale with the dilution factor. \n\nSo, suppose the number of recombinant plumes R1 in the first half (dilution 1:10^7) is R1, and R2 in the second half (dilution 1:10^5) is R2. Since the dilution factors are different, R1 and R2 should be proportional to the dilution factors. So R2 = R1 * (10^7)/(10^5) )= R1 * 100. \n\nGiven that R1 is 4 and R2 is 40, which fits 4*100=40. So this supports the idea that the number of recombinants scales with the dilution factor. \n\nNow, applying the formula R = 2pq, where R is the number of recombinants. So 4 = 2pq => pq = 2. But p and q are fractions less than 1, so their product cannot exceed 1. This suggests a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula applies to the proportion of the population rather than the absolute number. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the frequency of each mutation, p and q, such that R = 2pq. If the total number of plasmids is N, then R = 2pq*N. Solving for pq, pq = R/N. If N is 44, then pq=4/44\u22480.0909. Assuming p=q, then p\u2248sqrt(0.0909)=0.3015. Thus, recombination rate is 2pq\u22480.182, or 18%. Again, this doesn't align with the options. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. In reality, when dealing with phage titration, the number of recombinant colonies R is given by R = 2pq * D, where D is the dilution factor. But in this case, the dilution factors are different for each sample. Alternatively, the recombination rate is determined by the ratio of recombinant colonies to the sum of recombinant and non-recombinant colonies. \n\nSince R1 = 4 and R2 = 40, the total number of colonies in each sample is 44 (1:10^7 dilution) and 440 (1:10^5 dilution). The proportion of recombinants in the first sample is 4/44\u22489%, and in the second sample, it's 40/440\u22489.09%. These are almost identical, which makes sense because the dilution factors differ by a factor of 100, but the number of recombinants scales accordingly. \n\nThus, the recombination rate is consistent across samples, indicating that the two mutations are indeed tightly linked. To find the percentage of recombination, we can use the fact that R = 2pq, where R is the number of recombinant plumes, and p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. \n\nIf R = 4 and N = 44, then pq = R/N = 4/44\u22480.0909. Assuming p = q (since the mutations are symmetrically placed), then p = q = sqrt(0.0909)=0.3015. Thus, the recombination rate is 2*p*q\u22480.182, or 18%. But this is not among the options provided. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the map distance in centiMorgans (cM). The relationship between cM and the recombination rate is R = 100*cM. If the map distance is x cM, then the recombination rate is 100x%. \n\nBut how do we convert R to cM? Using R = 2pq, where p and q are the allele frequencies. If we assume p = q, then R = 2p\u00b2. Solving for p, p = sqrt(R/2). With R=4, p=sqrt(4/2)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414%. But this exceeds 1%, which is impossible. So perhaps my approach is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula considers the cross-over frequency, which is the same as the recombination rate expressed as a percentage. So if the cross-over rate is 5%, then 5% of the potential recombinants occur. Given that only 4 out of 44 plumes are recombinant, this suggests a cross-over rate higher than expected. \n\nBut without precise calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage. However, given the options, the highest plausible percentage is 5% (option H). Therefore, I'll choose H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if four plates show four plumes each, that would mean four successful infections. Similarly, for B, 40 plumes indicate 40 infections. \n\nNow, I remember that when two genes recombine, the probability of independent assortment decreases because of the crossing over. However, in phage titration experiments, the number of recombinants depends on how much they have combined. If the two mutations are tightly linked, their occurrence would be more dependent on where they occurred along the chromosome. Each mutation has a certain frequency, and when they recombine, you get double the frequency of either mutation. \n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the total frequency of each type (mutant A, mutant B, and recombinant AB) would just add up. For example, if the frequency of mutant A is p and mutant B is q, without recombination, the frequency of AB would be pq. But here, we're seeing more than expected, especially since only a small fraction (4 out of 40) shows up on strain K. That suggests that the two mutations must have recombined significantly. \n\nThe formula I recall relates the number of recombinant colonies to the product of the frequencies of the two parental alleles. Specifically, the number of recombinants R is approximately equal to 2pq, assuming no interference and random assortment. In this case, the number of recombinant plumes is 4, while the total number of plumes is 44 (40 on B + 4 on K). So R = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Therefore, 0.0909 \u2248 2pq. \n\nAssuming each mutation occurs at a certain frequency, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the lytic phage. Since the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause damage, let's assume p > q. Without knowing exact frequencies, perhaps we can infer from the ratio. If 0.0909 \u2248 2pq, and considering that the mutations are separate, maybe p \u2248 q, making pq very small. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each mutation occurs once per phage, so the total number of each type of phage is proportional to their original frequencies. \n\nWait, another approach: if the two mutations are linked, the chance that a phage carrying both mutations (recombinant) will infect is higher. The observed number of recombinant plumes should be higher than what would be expected under independent assortment. Here, only 4 out of 44, which is roughly 9%, seems high. If they were completely linked, the recombinant rate would be lower, possibly around 5-10%. So 9% is quite high, suggesting significant recombination. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can calculate how many times the two mutations have swapped. Since each mutation contributes to the overall arrangement, the percentage of recombination could be calculated as (R / (p + q)) * 100. But without exact values for p and q, this might be tricky. Another way is to consider that if R = 2pq, then rearranging gives pq = R/(2). Assuming R is 4, pq = 4/2=2. But since p and q are fractions less than 1, their product being 2 isn't possible. This indicates my initial assumption might be wrong. Perhaps instead, R = 2pq, so 4/44 \u2248 2pq => pq \u2248 0.1818. If we take p \u2248 q, then p\u00b2 \u2248 0.1818 => p \u2248 sqrt(0.1818) \u2248 0.426. So each mutation has a frequency of about 42.6%, leading to pq \u2248 0.426*0.426\u22480.1818, which matches. Then, the percentage of recombination would be (2pq)/100% \u2248 (2*0.1818)*100%\u224836.36%. Wait, that's way too high. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nAnother thought: the number of recombinants R is approximately equal to 2pq/(p+q) * N, where N is the total population. But without knowing N, it's hard to apply directly. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is R = 2pq*(number of cells or plasmids plated). Wait, in this case, each plume corresponds to a single phage infection. So if R = 4, and the total plasmids are 44, then R = 4/44 * (total plasmids). Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the recombination increases the likelihood of both mutations occurring together, the number of recombinant plumes should be higher. The observed number is 4, which is 9% of 44. If the maximum possible would be 2pq, then 4 = 2pq => pq = 2. But p and q can\u2019t exceed 1, so this doesn\u2019t hold. Maybe the actual calculation is simpler. \n\nPerhaps the key point is that the presence of 4 recombinant plumes out of 44 suggests that the two mutations have recombined significantly. To estimate the percentage of recombination, we can use the fact that the observed number of recombinants (R) is approximately equal to 2pq*N, where N is the number of phages plated. But without knowing N, perhaps we can relate the relative numbers. Alternatively, if the two mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinants would be higher than if they were independent. Given that only 4 out of 44 showed recombination, this suggests a relatively high level of recombination. \n\nLooking back at the options provided, the percentages given suggest that the recombination is minimal, ranging from 0.02% to 5%. The high number of recombinant plumes (4 out of 44) suggests that the two mutations are highly related. Even though the exact calculation requires knowing the individual frequencies, a high number like 9% strongly points towards significant recombination. Among the options, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, and others are smaller. Since 9% is closer to 5%, option H (5%) seems plausible. Alternatively, if the calculation leads to exactly 9%, but none of the options match, perhaps the closest answer is H. But wait, the calculation led to pq\u22480.1818, implying a recombination rate of ~36%, which is way off. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me look up the phage titration method. In phage titration experiments, the number of recombinant colonies (R) is estimated using R \u2248 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the two parental alleles. The total number of plasmids (or phages) is N. So R = 2pqN. Rearranging, pq = R/N. If N is large, pq is small. If N is small, pq could be larger. But in our case, N is 44, so pq \u2248 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Taking square root, p \u2248 q \u2248 0.3. So each mutation has a frequency of about 30%. Then, recombination rate would be 2pq \u2248 2*0.3*0.3=0.18, or 18%, which still doesn't align with any of the options. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, it says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the dilution factors are 1:10^5 vs. 1:10^7. Dilutions affect the concentration of the phage in the media. Higher dilution means fewer phages are present per unit volume. \n\nIn phage titration, the number of recombinant colonies is used to determine the map units between two loci. The formula is R = 2pq, where p and q are the allele frequencies. However, if the two mutations are close together, the actual frequency of each mutation may be slightly higher due to the linkage effect. \n\nGiven that only 4 out of 44 colonies are recombinants, this suggests that the two mutations are quite closely linked. The percentage of recombination can be estimated by comparing the observed number of recombinants to the expected number if they were independent. If R_observed / R_expected = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909, then the recombination rate is higher than expected for independent assortment. \n\nIf the mutations are nearly linked, the recombination rate could be as high as 50%. But the options don't go that high. The highest option is G (0.5%), followed by H (5%). Since 9% is closer to 5%, perhaps the answer is H. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is more straightforward. \n\nAnother approach: the number of recombinant plumes (R) is approximately equal to twice the product of the frequencies of the two mutations (R \u2248 2pq). If R is 4, and the total number of plasmids plated is 44, then pq \u2248 4/44 \u2248 0.0909. Assuming each mutation is equally frequent (p=q), then p\u00b2 \u2248 0.0909 => p \u2248 0.3015. So each mutation occurs about 30% of the time. Then, the recombination rate would be 2pq \u2248 2*0.3015*0.3015\u22480.182, or 18%. But again, this doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula accounts for the dilution. Since one half is diluted 1:10^7 and the other 1:10^5, the effective concentrations differ. The number of phages available for each half is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So the first half has 10^7 phages per mL, and the second has 10^5 phages per mL. \n\nWhen you plate a certain number of cells, the number of phages available is proportional to the dilution factor. So the number of phages available for the first half is 10^7, and for the second half, it's 10^5. If the number of phages per colony is constant, then the number of recombinants should scale with the dilution factor. \n\nSo, suppose the number of recombinant plumes R1 in the first half (dilution 1:10^7) is R1, and R2 in the second half (dilution 1:10^5) is R2. Since the dilution factors are different, R1 and R2 should be proportional to the dilution factors. So R2 = R1 * (10^7)/(10^5) )= R1 * 100. \n\nGiven that R1 is 4 and R2 is 40, which fits 4*100=40. So this supports the idea that the number of recombinants scales with the dilution factor. \n\nNow, applying the formula R = 2pq, where R is the number of recombinants. So 4 = 2pq => pq = 2. But p and q are fractions less than 1, so their product cannot exceed 1. This suggests a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula applies to the proportion of the population rather than the absolute number. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the frequency of each mutation, p and q, such that R = 2pq. If the total number of plasmids is N, then R = 2pq*N. Solving for pq, pq = R/N. If N is 44, then pq=4/44\u22480.0909. Assuming p=q, then p\u2248sqrt(0.0909)=0.3015. Thus, recombination rate is 2pq\u22480.182, or 18%. Again, this doesn't align with the options. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. In reality, when dealing with phage titration, the number of recombinant colonies R is given by R = 2pq * D, where D is the dilution factor. But in this case, the dilution factors are different for each sample. Alternatively, the recombination rate is determined by the ratio of recombinant colonies to the sum of recombinant and non-recombinant colonies. \n\nSince R1 = 4 and R2 = 40, the total number of colonies in each sample is 44 (1:10^7 dilution) and 440 (1:10^5 dilution). The proportion of recombinants in the first sample is 4/44\u22489%, and in the second sample, it's 40/440\u22489.09%. These are almost identical, which makes sense because the dilution factors differ by a factor of 100, but the number of recombinants scales accordingly. \n\nThus, the recombination rate is consistent across samples, indicating that the two mutations are indeed tightly linked.

Assuming p = q (since the mutations are symmetrically placed), then p = q = sqrt(0.0909)=0.3015. Thus, the recombination rate is 2*p*q\u22480.182, or 18%. But this is not among the options provided. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the map distance in centiMorgans (cM). The relationship between cM and the recombination rate is R = 100*cM.

    "rollout": " So 4 plumes would mean 4 new phages have taken over the cells, leading to a lytic cycle.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to how often the two mutation sites interact during replication. If there's no recombination, the mutations would act independently\u2014so if one mutation makes the phage lytic, the other could make it lysogenic. But if they do recombine, their effects might overlap or influence each other.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutant types leads to a higher number of infections on strain K compared to B. On strain B, only 40 plumes occurred, while on K, it was 4. That seems like a significant difference, suggesting that the lysogenic phage from the other type affects more efficiently on strain K. However, I'm a bit confused about what exactly determines the number of plumes. Each plume corresponds to a successful infection, so the total number indicates the overall efficiency of the mutants.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the concept of interference. If the two mutations interfere, the combined effect might be less than the sum of individual effects. But here, we're seeing a high number of plumes on K despite some mutations being present. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants increases the chance of efficient lysis, meaning fewer plumes occur on strain B where the lysogenic phage isn't effective, but more on strain K where the lysogenic phage is effective because of the interaction.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The key is to determine how much of the time the two mutations happen together. In the absence of recombination, each mutation acts independently. On average, you'd expect the probability of both happening to be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, if they recombine, the probability changes depending on whether they are homologous or heterologous. Since these are different regions (T4 vs T6), I think they are homologous within the same phage type, but the two mutant types come from different phage types, so recombination might reduce the combined effect.\n\nLet me denote p as the recombination frequency. If there's no recombination, the probability that both mutations occur is p * q, where q is the probability for the lysogenic phage. But wait, actually, in the absence of recombination, the mutations would act independently, so the expected number of infections would depend on the product of their probabilities. However, in the presence of recombination, their actions might interfere, reducing the effective probability.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the double mutant scenario, the probability of both mutations occurring together (recombination) reduces the chance of either mutation causing problems. This means that when both mutants are present, the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage decreases due to the interference caused by the recombined lysogen.\n\nGiven the numbers, let's consider the ratio of plumes. Strain B had 40, and strain K had 4. So the ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more effective against strain K than against itself. Maybe the recombination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage on strain K enough to cause only 4 plumes instead of 40.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would be higher because both mutations are acting independently. With recombination, the number is lower because the lysogenic phage's activity is reduced due to the presence of the recombined lysogen.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, I need to relate the observed data to the expected probabilities under independent versus recombinant scenarios.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the probability of the lysogenic phage causing a problem alone is q. Then, the expected number of plumes on strain B (where the lysogenic phage isn\u2019t effective) would be proportional to q. However, when both mutant types are present, the effective probability becomes p * q, assuming no interference. But in reality, if recombination occurs, the effective probability might be adjusted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for double mutants. The probability of both mutations is p * q. If there's no interference, the number of plumes would reflect this product. But if there is interference due to recombination, the actual number observed might be lower.\n\nHowever, given that the exact model is unclear, I'll proceed with the assumption that the recombination frequency 'p' relates to the ratio of plumes. If the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, then the probability of recombination is very low, meaning that most of the events follow independent probabilities. Thus, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Another approach: the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem) times (number of cells). Similarly, on strain K, it's (probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem plus any additional effects from the recombination).\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way is to calculate the expected number of plumes under independence and compare it to the observed numbers to estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (q) * N, where N is the number of cells. Similarly, on strain K, it would be (q + r) * N, where r is the recombination rate affecting strain K. But this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a decrease in the number of plumes on strain K, indicating that the recombination reduces the effective lysogenic activity on K.\n\nMaybe using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (Probability of lysogenic phage) / (Probability of lysogenic phage + Probability of lysogenic phage - p)\n\nWhere p is the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure about this formula. It might not be accurate.\n\nAnother thought: the ratio of plumes (K: B = 40:4 = 10:1) implies that the presence of the recombinant phage reduces the lysogenic activity on strain K. So, the expected number of plumes without recombination would be lower because the lysogenic phage from the other type has a higher chance of causing issues.\n\nTherefore, if the recombination frequency is low, the number of plumes would be closer to the expected value under independence.\n\nSo, let's suppose that without recombination, the number of plumes on strain B would be higher, say M, and on strain K, it would be M + R, where R accounts for the recombination effect.\n\nBut in our case, the plumes on B are 40, and on K, 4. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the recombination reduces the lysogenic activity on K enough to cause only 4 plumes.\n\nIf the expected number without recombination is 40 on B and 40 on K, but with recombination, it drops to 4 on K. Therefore, the recombination must explain a factor of 10 reduction in lysogenic activity on K.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the effective probability of lysogenic activity on K is reduced by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the original probability of lysogenic activity was q, then the effective probability becomes q * (1 - p), where p is the recombination frequency. Assuming that the reduction factor is 10, we have:\n\n(1 - p) \u2248 1/10 \u21d2 p \u2248 9/10 = 0.9\n\nBut that can't be right because a recombination frequency of 90% would imply that nearly all interactions occur, making the lysogenic activity on K almost non-existent. However, the observed number of plumes on K is 4, which is much lower than the expected 40. So perhaps my initial assumption about the reduction factor is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 10:1, meaning that the effective lysogenic activity on K is 1/10 of the original. So, (1 - p) \u2248 1/10 \u21d2 p\u22480.9, which again doesn't seem right.\n\nPerhaps another approach: Using the equation for double mutants, the expected number of plumes on each strain depends on the probabilities of each mutation and their interaction.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- P(LY) = probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem (on its own).\n- P(K) = probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem on K.\n- p = recombination frequency between LY and K.\n\nWithout recombination, P(K) = P(LY) * (1 - p).\n\nWith recombination, the effective P(K) = P(LY) * (1 - p) + P(K) * p.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the correct model here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed plumes:\n- Without recombination, the number of plumes on K would be higher than on B.\n- With recombination, the number on K decreases significantly.\n\nGiven that on B, the number is 40, and on K, it's 4, the recombination must have reduced the lysogenic activity on K by a factor of 10.\n\nThus, if the original number of plumes on K were X, now it's X/10 = 4 \u21d2 X=40. So the recombination explains why the number dropped by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, the question is, how does recombination affect the number of plumes? It probably affects the probability of lysogenic activity on K.\n\nIf recombination reduces the probability of lysogenic activity on K by a certain factor, then the number of plumes would be scaled accordingly.\n\nSuppose without recombination, the probability of lysogenic activity on K is Q. With recombination, it becomes Q * (1 - p). Then, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (Q * (1 - p)).\n\nIf originally, the number of plumes on K would have been Y, and with recombination, it's Y * (1 - p). We know that Y * (1 - p) = 4, and Y (without recombination) would have been higher.\n\nBut without knowing Y, it's hard to compute p directly. However, we can infer that (1 - p) \u2248 1/10, leading to p\u22480.9. But that seems too high, as it would imply that recombination is almost complete.\n\nWait, but perhaps the ratio of plumes reflects the relative contributions. If recombination reduces the lysogenic activity on K by a factor of 10, then the number of plumes on K is 1/10 of what it would be without recombination. Similarly, on B, if the lysogenic phage from the other type doesn't interfere, the number of plumes should remain similar or higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is small, such that the effective probability remains roughly the same, but the observed number is slightly lower due to some other factor.\n\nGiven the options provided, let me look at the answer choices:\n\nA. 1%\nB. 2%\nC. 1.5%\nD. 0.1%\nE. 0.2%\nF. 0.3%\nG. 0.5%\nH. 5%\nI. 0.02%\nJ. 0.05%\n\nSince the observed number on K is 4, which is a quarter of the expected 40 (if no recombination), this suggests a significant reduction in lysogenic activity on K. So the recombination must be substantial.\n\nIf the expected number without recombination is 40, and with recombination it's 4, then the ratio is 1/10. Assuming that the recombination reduces the lysogenic activity by a factor of 10, then p \u2248 9/10 = 0.9, which is 90%. But none of the answer choices go up to 90%.\n\nLooking back, maybe the reduction isn't exactly a factor of 10 but approximately. For example, if the effective probability on K is 1/10th of the expected, then p \u2248 0.09, which rounds to 1%. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the double mutant occurrence probability. The probability that both mutations occur is p * q, where p is the recombination frequency and q is the probability of lysogenic activity. If we assume that without recombination, q = 1, then the probability becomes p. However, in our case, the observed number of plumes suggests a lower probability, implying a lower recombination frequency.\n\nBut without precise formulas, it's challenging. Given the answer choices, the closest plausible recombination frequency is around 1%, possibly option G.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers, if the recombination frequency is 1%, then the probability of recombination is 0.01, and the probability of lysogenic activity is say 0.8, then the combined probability is 0.01*0.8 = 0.008, which would lead to a certain number of plumes. But without more specifics, it's difficult to pin down.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose option C (1.5%) as a reasonable approximation, though I'm aware this is speculative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 4 plumes would mean 4 new phages have taken over the cells, leading to a lytic cycle.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to how often the two mutation sites interact during replication. If there's no recombination, the mutations would act independently\u2014so if one mutation makes the phage lytic, the other could make it lysogenic. But if they do recombine, their effects might overlap or influence each other.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutant types leads to a higher number of infections on strain K compared to B. On strain B, only 40 plumes occurred, while on K, it was 4. That seems like a significant difference, suggesting that the lysogenic phage from the other type affects more efficiently on strain K. However, I'm a bit confused about what exactly determines the number of plumes. Each plume corresponds to a successful infection, so the total number indicates the overall efficiency of the mutants.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the concept of interference. If the two mutations interfere, the combined effect might be less than the sum of individual effects. But here, we're seeing a high number of plumes on K despite some mutations being present. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants increases the chance of efficient lysis, meaning fewer plumes occur on strain B where the lysogenic phage isn't effective, but more on strain K where the lysogenic phage is effective because of the interaction.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The key is to determine how much of the time the two mutations happen together. In the absence of recombination, each mutation acts independently. On average, you'd expect the probability of both happening to be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, if they recombine, the probability changes depending on whether they are homologous or heterologous. Since these are different regions (T4 vs T6), I think they are homologous within the same phage type, but the two mutant types come from different phage types, so recombination might reduce the combined effect.\n\nLet me denote p as the recombination frequency. If there's no recombination, the probability that both mutations occur is p * q, where q is the probability for the lysogenic phage. But wait, actually, in the absence of recombination, the mutations would act independently, so the expected number of infections would depend on the product of their probabilities. However, in the presence of recombination, their actions might interfere, reducing the effective probability.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the double mutant scenario, the probability of both mutations occurring together (recombination) reduces the chance of either mutation causing problems. This means that when both mutants are present, the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage decreases due to the interference caused by the recombined lysogen.\n\nGiven the numbers, let's consider the ratio of plumes. Strain B had 40, and strain K had 4. So the ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more effective against strain K than against itself. Maybe the recombination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage on strain K enough to cause only 4 plumes instead of 40.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would be higher because both mutations are acting independently. With recombination, the number is lower because the lysogenic phage's activity is reduced due to the presence of the recombined lysogen.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, I need to relate the observed data to the expected probabilities under independent versus recombinant scenarios.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the probability of the lysogenic phage causing a problem alone is q. Then, the expected number of plumes on strain B (where the lysogenic phage isn\u2019t effective) would be proportional to q. However, when both mutant types are present, the effective probability becomes p * q, assuming no interference. But in reality, if recombination occurs, the effective probability might be adjusted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for double mutants. The probability of both mutations is p * q. If there's no interference, the number of plumes would reflect this product. But if there is interference due to recombination, the actual number observed might be lower.\n\nHowever, given that the exact model is unclear, I'll proceed with the assumption that the recombination frequency 'p' relates to the ratio of plumes. If the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, then the probability of recombination is very low, meaning that most of the events follow independent probabilities. Thus, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Another approach: the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem) times (number of cells). Similarly, on strain K, it's (probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem plus any additional effects from the recombination).\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way is to calculate the expected number of plumes under independence and compare it to the observed numbers to estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be (q) * N, where N is the number of cells. Similarly, on strain K, it would be (q + r) * N, where r is the recombination rate affecting strain K. But this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a decrease in the number of plumes on strain K, indicating that the recombination reduces the effective lysogenic activity on K.\n\nMaybe using the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (Probability of lysogenic phage) / (Probability of lysogenic phage + Probability of lysogenic phage - p)\n\nWhere p is the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure about this formula. It might not be accurate.\n\nAnother thought: the ratio of plumes (K: B = 40:4 = 10:1) implies that the presence of the recombinant phage reduces the lysogenic activity on strain K. So, the expected number of plumes without recombination would be lower because the lysogenic phage from the other type has a higher chance of causing issues.\n\nTherefore, if the recombination frequency is low, the number of plumes would be closer to the expected value under independence.\n\nSo, let's suppose that without recombination, the number of plumes on strain B would be higher, say M, and on strain K, it would be M + R, where R accounts for the recombination effect.\n\nBut in our case, the plumes on B are 40, and on K, 4. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the recombination reduces the lysogenic activity on K enough to cause only 4 plumes.\n\nIf the expected number without recombination is 40 on B and 40 on K, but with recombination, it drops to 4 on K. Therefore, the recombination must explain a factor of 10 reduction in lysogenic activity on K.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is such that the effective probability of lysogenic activity on K is reduced by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the original probability of lysogenic activity was q, then the effective probability becomes q * (1 - p), where p is the recombination frequency. Assuming that the reduction factor is 10, we have:\n\n(1 - p) \u2248 1/10 \u21d2 p \u2248 9/10 = 0.9\n\nBut that can't be right because a recombination frequency of 90% would imply that nearly all interactions occur, making the lysogenic activity on K almost non-existent. However, the observed number of plumes on K is 4, which is much lower than the expected 40. So perhaps my initial assumption about the reduction factor is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 10:1, meaning that the effective lysogenic activity on K is 1/10 of the original. So, (1 - p) \u2248 1/10 \u21d2 p\u22480.9, which again doesn't seem right.\n\nPerhaps another approach: Using the equation for double mutants, the expected number of plumes on each strain depends on the probabilities of each mutation and their interaction.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- P(LY) = probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem (on its own).\n- P(K) = probability of lysogenic phage causing a problem on K.\n- p = recombination frequency between LY and K.\n\nWithout recombination, P(K) = P(LY) * (1 - p).\n\nWith recombination, the effective P(K) = P(LY) * (1 - p) + P(K) * p.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the correct model here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the observed plumes:\n- Without recombination, the number of plumes on K would be higher than on B.\n- With recombination, the number on K decreases significantly.\n\nGiven that on B, the number is 40, and on K, it's 4, the recombination must have reduced the lysogenic activity on K by a factor of 10.\n\nThus, if the original number of plumes on K were X, now it's X/10 = 4 \u21d2 X=40. So the recombination explains why the number dropped by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, the question is, how does recombination affect the number of plumes? It probably affects the probability of lysogenic activity on K.\n\nIf recombination reduces the probability of lysogenic activity on K by a certain factor, then the number of plumes would be scaled accordingly.\n\nSuppose without recombination, the probability of lysogenic activity on K is Q. With recombination, it becomes Q * (1 - p).

However, we can infer that (1 - p) \u2248 1/10, leading to p\u22480.9.

    "chunk_resampled": "So 40 plumes mean 40 infections, and 4 means 4.",
    "rollout": " So 40 plumes mean 40 infections, and 4 means 4. \n\nNow, the key here is figuring out how much recombination there is between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two genes located close to each other. In phages, especially T4, this usually happens during replication, leading to different fission methods. The presence of multiple mutants in the same phage indicates some interaction, possibly through recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is ((number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring)) * 100%. But wait, in this context, we're dealing with the distribution of the two mutants. Each phage has two alleles at the same locus, and if they are recombined, certain combinations won't occur. For example, if the original phage had allele A and B, a recombined version would have A and C, where C is a new mutation from another phage.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types of phages are present, the outcome depends on whether their alleles interact. If they do, you might see fewer recombinants than expected without recombination. Here, the majority of the E. coli strain B is affected, meaning that most of the plasmids have either been lost or are functional. However, some remain because they didn't lyse the cells. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysogeny, making the phage live longer) did not successfully replicate, while the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lytic fission; it's supposed to cause lysogeny, keeping the phage inside the host cell. So if the lysogenic phage is causing issues, maybe it's the lysogenic variant that isn't working as intended. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are interacting, leading to some recombination.\n\nGiven that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is more active or causing issues. But if the lysogenic phage is resistant, then the problem must be with the other type, the lysogenic phage that causes lytic fission, which is dead. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem states that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse the cell) is causing problems in strain B, whereas strain K's lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage (from strain K?) is causing issues? Or perhaps the recombination leads to a situation where some plasmids are non-functional, thus reducing the overall effect.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the lysogenic phage (strain K) causes issues in strain B, indicating that their alleles interact. If they recombine, some plasmids lose function, affecting the outcome. Since the majority of the E. coli strain B is affected, and some are not, this could indicate that recombination occurred, as the non-recombinant alleles lead to full functionality.\n\nSo, the scenario suggests that recombination happened between the two mutations in the T4 phage. Now, to calculate the percentage of recombination:\n\nThe formula is (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%.\n\nBut in this case, we have counts from plating. Strain B was mostly affected, meaning that the recombination likely led to some loss of function. The count ratio can give us the idea.\n\nStrain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So the ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the functional mutant (non-combined alleles) are 1 part, and the recombinant ones are 10 parts. So the proportion of recombination is 1/(1+10) = 1/11 \u2248 9.09%, which is about 9%. But the options don't include 9%, closest is option G, which is 0.5%. Hmm, that's way off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Another method is to use the ratio of the frequencies. If the frequency of recombinant plasmids is higher than expected under independent assortment, it suggests recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- F1 = number of recombinant offspring (plumes)\n- F2 = number of parental offspring (not recombinant)\n\nTotal = F1 + F2\n\nPercentage of recombination = (F1 / Total) * 100%\n\nHere, F1 = 40, F2 = 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming all except 4 are recombinant).\n\nTotal = 40 + 36 = 76\n\nRecombination percentage = (40 / 76) * 100% \u2248 52.63%, which is way too high. Clearly, this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: The presence of recombination reduces the likelihood of recombining events, hence increasing the occurrence of parental combinations.\n\nIf we consider that without recombination, the probability of inheriting a non-functional allele would be lower. But in our case, the majority of strain B is affected, indicating that the non-recombinant allele is dominant, and recombination causes the loss of function.\n\nAnother formula used in genetics is the chi-squared test for goodness of fit. The observed data (4 vs 40) compared to the expected (under complete independence, which would be 40 each, so 80 total). The chi-squared statistic would be calculated as:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nWhere O = observed, E = expected.\n\nFor each category:\n(40 - 40)^2 / 40 = 0\n(4 - 40)^2 / 40 = (16)^2 /40=256/40=6.4\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = 0 + 6.4 = 6.4\n\nDegrees of freedom = 1.\n\nLooking up the critical value for \u03c7\u00b2 at \u03b1=0.05 with df=1 is about 3.84. Our \u03c7\u00b2 is 6.4 > 3.84, so we reject the null hypothesis of independent assortment. Hence, significant recombination.\n\nTo find the degree of recombination (r), we can use the formula:\n\nr = (observed recombinant - expected recombinant) / observed total\n\nWait, no. Actually, r can be estimated using:\n\nr = [O12 - E12] / O_total\n\nWhere O12 is the observed recombinant, E12 is expected under independent assortment, which would be (total * p*(1-p)), assuming p is the probability of recombination.\n\nBut let's try another approach. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (Z) is:\n\nZ = (Observed recombinant / Expected recombinant)^(1/n)\n\nWhere n is the number of co-factors, which is 2 here (alleles).\n\nBut Z is also equal to (1 - r)/(1 + r). Rearranging gives:\n\nr = (1 - Z)/(1 + Z)\n\nBut first, we need to calculate Z. Z is the observed recombinant divided by the expected recombinant under independent assortment.\n\nExpected recombinant = (total offspring) * p*(1-p)\n\nAssuming p is the probability of recombination per generation, say p=0.01% or very low.\n\nBut given the numbers, the observed recombinant is 40, total is 76, so Z = 40/76 \u2248 0.526.\n\nThen, r = (1 - 0.526)/(1 + 0.526) \u2248 0.474 / 1.526 \u2248 0.31.\n\nThat's around 31%, which is still high. None of the answer choices match this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombination can be directly calculated from the ratio of the frequencies.\n\nSince 40 out of 76 are recombinant, the percentage is approximately 52.6%. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation uses the ratio of the plasmid frequencies. Maybe the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 40/76 \u2248 52.6%, but that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B is causing issues, which suggests that the recombination allows the loss of function. Since the recombination rate is involved, perhaps the percentage is small.\n\nLooking back, the possible answers are percentages like 0.05% or similar. The initial thought process may have misapplied the formula, perhaps thinking of the recombination rate as being inversely proportional to the difference in plasmid frequencies.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is option F: 0.3 percent. Because if the recombination rate is such that the product of the two allele frequencies equals the observed recombinant frequency, perhaps.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\np * q = r\n\nWhere p and q are the allele frequencies. Suppose each mutation occurs at a frequency of x% and y% respectively. Then,\n\nx * y = r\n\nWe know that x + y = 100% (if considering two alleles). But without knowing x and y, it's hard. Alternatively, if we assume that the recombination rate is 0.3%, then that matches option F.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers:\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the majority of E. coli strain B is affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing issues. If the recombination leads to the loss of function, then the recombination rate is such that the non-recombinant allele is dominant.\n\nThus, the percentage of recombination would be the product of the frequencies of the two alleles, which sum to 100%, but the exact values depend on the specific mutations.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage, but among the options, 0.3% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes mean 40 infections, and 4 means 4. \n\nNow, the key here is figuring out how much recombination there is between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two genes located close to each other. In phages, especially T4, this usually happens during replication, leading to different fission methods. The presence of multiple mutants in the same phage indicates some interaction, possibly through recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is ((number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring)) * 100%. But wait, in this context, we're dealing with the distribution of the two mutants. Each phage has two alleles at the same locus, and if they are recombined, certain combinations won't occur. For example, if the original phage had allele A and B, a recombined version would have A and C, where C is a new mutation from another phage.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types of phages are present, the outcome depends on whether their alleles interact. If they do, you might see fewer recombinants than expected without recombination. Here, the majority of the E. coli strain B is affected, meaning that most of the plasmids have either been lost or are functional. However, some remain because they didn't lyse the cells. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysogeny, making the phage live longer) did not successfully replicate, while the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lytic fission; it's supposed to cause lysogeny, keeping the phage inside the host cell. So if the lysogenic phage is causing issues, maybe it's the lysogenic variant that isn't working as intended. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are interacting, leading to some recombination.\n\nGiven that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is more active or causing issues. But if the lysogenic phage is resistant, then the problem must be with the other type, the lysogenic phage that causes lytic fission, which is dead. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem states that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse the cell) is causing problems in strain B, whereas strain K's lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage (from strain K?) is causing issues? Or perhaps the recombination leads to a situation where some plasmids are non-functional, thus reducing the overall effect.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the lysogenic phage (strain K) causes issues in strain B, indicating that their alleles interact. If they recombine, some plasmids lose function, affecting the outcome. Since the majority of the E. coli strain B is affected, and some are not, this could indicate that recombination occurred, as the non-recombinant alleles lead to full functionality.\n\nSo, the scenario suggests that recombination happened between the two mutations in the T4 phage. Now, to calculate the percentage of recombination:\n\nThe formula is (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%.\n\nBut in this case, we have counts from plating. Strain B was mostly affected, meaning that the recombination likely led to some loss of function. The count ratio can give us the idea.\n\nStrain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So the ratio is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the functional mutant (non-combined alleles) are 1 part, and the recombinant ones are 10 parts. So the proportion of recombination is 1/(1+10) = 1/11 \u2248 9.09%, which is about 9%. But the options don't include 9%, closest is option G, which is 0.5%. Hmm, that's way off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Another method is to use the ratio of the frequencies. If the frequency of recombinant plasmids is higher than expected under independent assortment, it suggests recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- F1 = number of recombinant offspring (plumes)\n- F2 = number of parental offspring (not recombinant)\n\nTotal = F1 + F2\n\nPercentage of recombination = (F1 / Total) * 100%\n\nHere, F1 = 40, F2 = 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming all except 4 are recombinant).\n\nTotal = 40 + 36 = 76\n\nRecombination percentage = (40 / 76) * 100% \u2248 52.63%, which is way too high. Clearly, this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative approach: The presence of recombination reduces the likelihood of recombining events, hence increasing the occurrence of parental combinations.\n\nIf we consider that without recombination, the probability of inheriting a non-functional allele would be lower. But in our case, the majority of strain B is affected, indicating that the non-recombinant allele is dominant, and recombination causes the loss of function.\n\nAnother formula used in genetics is the chi-squared test for goodness of fit. The observed data (4 vs 40) compared to the expected (under complete independence, which would be 40 each, so 80 total). The chi-squared statistic would be calculated as:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nWhere O = observed, E = expected.\n\nFor each category:\n(40 - 40)^2 / 40 = 0\n(4 - 40)^2 / 40 = (16)^2 /40=256/40=6.4\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = 0 + 6.4 = 6.4\n\nDegrees of freedom = 1.\n\nLooking up the critical value for \u03c7\u00b2 at \u03b1=0.05 with df=1 is about 3.84. Our \u03c7\u00b2 is 6.4 > 3.84, so we reject the null hypothesis of independent assortment. Hence, significant recombination.\n\nTo find the degree of recombination (r), we can use the formula:\n\nr = (observed recombinant - expected recombinant) / observed total\n\nWait, no. Actually, r can be estimated using:\n\nr = [O12 - E12] / O_total\n\nWhere O12 is the observed recombinant, E12 is expected under independent assortment, which would be (total * p*(1-p)), assuming p is the probability of recombination.\n\nBut let's try another approach. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (Z) is:\n\nZ = (Observed recombinant / Expected recombinant)^(1/n)\n\nWhere n is the number of co-factors, which is 2 here (alleles).\n\nBut Z is also equal to (1 - r)/(1 + r). Rearranging gives:\n\nr = (1 - Z)/(1 + Z)\n\nBut first, we need to calculate Z. Z is the observed recombinant divided by the expected recombinant under independent assortment.\n\nExpected recombinant = (total offspring) * p*(1-p)\n\nAssuming p is the probability of recombination per generation, say p=0.01% or very low.\n\nBut given the numbers, the observed recombinant is 40, total is 76, so Z = 40/76 \u2248 0.526.\n\nThen, r = (1 - 0.526)/(1 + 0.526) \u2248 0.474 / 1.526 \u2248 0.31.\n\nThat's around 31%, which is still high. None of the answer choices match this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombination can be directly calculated from the ratio of the frequencies.\n\nSince 40 out of 76 are recombinant, the percentage is approximately 52.6%. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation uses the ratio of the plasmid frequencies. Maybe the fraction of recombinant plasmids is 40/76 \u2248 52.6%, but that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B is causing issues, which suggests that the recombination allows the loss of function. Since the recombination rate is involved, perhaps the percentage is small.\n\nLooking back, the possible answers are percentages like 0.05% or similar. The initial thought process may have misapplied the formula, perhaps thinking of the recombination rate as being inversely proportional to the difference in plasmid frequencies.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is option F: 0.3 percent. Because if the recombination rate is such that the product of the two allele frequencies equals the observed recombinant frequency, perhaps.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\np * q = r\n\nWhere p and q are the allele frequencies. Suppose each mutation occurs at a frequency of x% and y% respectively. Then,\n\nx * y = r\n\nWe know that x + y = 100% (if considering two alleles). But without knowing x and y, it's hard. Alternatively, if we assume that the recombination rate is 0.3%, then that matches option F.\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers:\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the majority of E. coli strain B is affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing issues. If the recombination leads to the loss of function, then the recombination rate is such that the non-recombinant allele is dominant.\n\nThus, the percentage of recombination would be the product of the frequencies of the two alleles, which sum to 100%, but the exact values depend on the specific mutations.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage, but among the options, 0.3% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

This could mean that the recombination reduces the efficiency of the lysogenic phage because it now works with the lysogenic mutation instead of the lysogenic phage itself. If there was no recombination, we'd expect similar numbers on both strains, but since there are more plumes on B, recombination must be occurring.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, I think the formula involves the number of recombinant offspring over the total possible. Here, the number of recombinant events (plumes) on K is 4, and on B is 40. The total number of possible events would be the product of the dilution factors. Since the first batch is diluted 1:10^7 and the second 1:10^5, the total dilution factor is 1/(10^7 * 10^5) = 1/10^(12).

Each time a recombination happens, it affects the fitness of both phages, potentially reducing their effectiveness when combined.\n\nGiven that the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, this indicates a significant degree of recombination. To find the percentage, we can consider that the number of recombination events is proportional to the square root of the observed difference. The square root of (40 - 4)/2 gives us approximately sqrt(18) \u2248 4.24%. Squaring that gives around 18%, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps it's directly related to the square root of the ratio of the larger group to the smaller one minus one, divided by two. So sqrt((40-4)/2) = sqrt(18/2)=sqrt(9)=3%. That would suggest about 3% recombination, which is close to option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Wait, my approximation gave about 3%, which aligns with option F (0.3%).\n\nBut wait, another approach: The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is given by rf = 1 - (number of non-recombinant events / total possible). If there are 40 on B and 4 on K, the total possible is 44, and the non-recombinant (or independent) would be 40 + 4 - rf*44. But solving for rf is tricky here. Perhaps a simpler method is to note that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, indicating that recombination occurred 10 times more often than not. The percentage would then be roughly 10%, but none of the options match exactly.

Double-dimers occur when two different mutations interact, leading to recombinant offspring. If we have two types of mutants, say A and B, the probability of their combination depends on how often they co-occur. The formula for the expected number of double-dimers is (p * q), where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation type. However, in this case, it seems like we're dealing with dilutions, so we might need to calculate based on the observed plumes. \n\nWait, let's think differently. In experiments involving double-dimers, if you plate on a lawn of one strain, and the other strain is present as a selective medium, you can count the number of colonies that survive. This survival rate is related to the frequency of double-dimers. For example, if the survival rate is S, then S = (p + q - 2pq)^2, assuming independent assortment. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the number of surviving cells indicates the presence of double-dimers. \n\nIn this problem, after mixing, the total number of plumes (infections) is distributed between the two strains. Since the first half was plated on B and the second on K, and considering the original population might be equal, the distribution could indicate the frequency of double-dimers. The result shows more infections on B (40%) than on K (4%). This suggests that the double-dimers are more common among B-resistant mutants, implying a positive relationship. \n\nTo find the recombination coefficient (c), which measures the proportion of double-dimers relative to the maximum possible, we can use the formula c = \u221a(\u0394), where \u0394 is the difference in survival rates. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Another way is to use the formula for the expected number of surviving cells, which relates to the double-dimer frequency. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the frequency of the double-dimers as f. The expected number of surviving cells would be f squared times the initial number of cells. But since the exact numbers aren't given, maybe we can infer the value based on the ratio of survivors. \n\nIf the survivor rate on B is 40% and on K is 4%, perhaps the double-dimers are responsible for the difference. Let\u2019s assume that without any double-dimers, all cells would survive (100%), but with double-dimers, some don't. The observed difference suggests that the double-dimers affect the outcome. \n\nAlternatively, thinking about the Hardy-Weinberg principle, but adjusted for double-dimers. Maybe the number of double-dimers affects the survival. If the double-dimers increase the survival rate, then the observed higher survival rate on B compared to K might suggest that the double-dimers favor B. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that in such experiments, the number of surviving cells is proportional to the square of the double-dimer frequency. So if f is the double-dimer frequency, then the survival rate would be f\u00b2 * N_initial / N_plated. Without specific numbers, it's tricky, but perhaps the ratio helps us determine f. \n\nGiven that 40% survived on B and 4% on K, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the double-dimers are more prevalent in B, indicating a positive correlation. To find f, we'd take the square root of the ratio, which would give us approximately 3.16%, but since we're looking for a single letter choice, the closest option is 1%, but wait, 1% squared is 1%, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the calculation uses a different factor. \n\nAnother angle: the number of double-dimers observed can help estimate the fitness effect. The difference in survivor rates might correspond to the double-dimer frequency. Using the formula, the double-dimer frequency c can be approximated by taking the square root of the ratio of the survivor rates. Here, survivor rate on B is 40%, on K is 4%. So the ratio is 10:1. Taking the square root gives around 3.16%, which rounds to about 3%, but our options don't include 3%. The closest lower option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Hmm, but my earlier thought led me to 3%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is c \u2248 \u221a(S_B / S_K), where S_B is the survival rate on B, and S_K on K. So S_B/S_K = 10. Then c \u2248 \u221a10 \u2248 3.16%, which again is close to 3%, but not exactly an option. Looking back at the choices: F is 0.3%, which is tenfold smaller than 3. Perhaps I should reconsider whether the formula uses the reciprocal. If S_B is 40% and S_K is 4%, then the ratio is 10. The square root is ~3.16, which is roughly 3.16%, but none of the options match this. Maybe the formula is c = sqrt(S_B * S_K). Then 40% *4% = 1.6%, sqrt of that is ~1.26%, which is closest to 1%, option A. But I'm not sure if this formula is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the double-dimers as the difference between the observed and expected plumes. On B, 40% survived, and on K, 4%. Assuming that the baseline without double-dimers is 50%, then the difference suggests that double-dimers reduce survival. But without precise counts, it's challenging. Given the answer choices, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of double-dimers leads to a certain survival rate. \n\nConsidering the high number of double-dimers on B, which is 40%, while fewer on K, suggesting that the double-dimers are more common on B. The recombination coefficient c would measure the likelihood of these mutations occurring together. If the double-dimers are frequent on B, it implies a positive recombination, meaning the mutations are linked. The exact calculation would involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation and their interaction, but without that data, we might have to infer based on the observed distribution.\n\nGiven the answer choices, and recognizing that 3% is close to option G (0.5%) and F (0.3%), and considering that the double-dimers may be around 1% frequency, the closest option is F (0.3%). But I'm still uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the double-dimers lead to increased survival, and using the formula c = 1 - (S_B + S_K)/2. Plugging in S_B=40% and S_K=4%, we get (40+4)/2=22%, so c\u224878%. That doesn't make sense, so maybe that formula isn't applicable here.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the observed plumes represent the double-dimers. If 40% survived on B and 4% on K, the number of double-dimers must explain why B has more survivors. The exact calculation requires knowing the double-dimer frequency, which might be derived from the ratio of survivors. Assuming that the double-dimer frequency is x, then the survival rate on B is x\u00b2*(initial cells)/plated cells. But without the initial cell count, it's hard to compute x directly. However, we can approximate that the ratio of survivors on B to K is 10:1, suggesting that the double-dimers are more common on B. \n\nGiven the answer choices, and considering that 1% corresponds to a low recombination coefficient, but perhaps closer to 1% being too low, whereas 0.3% is even lower. However, without precise calculations, I might lean towards option F (0.3%) as the most plausible answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 on B and 4 on K mean that 40% of the plates show infections on B and 4% on K. \n\nThe key here is the number of double-dimers formed from the mutantphages. Double-dimers occur when two different mutations interact, leading to recombinant offspring. If we have two types of mutants, say A and B, the probability of their combination depends on how often they co-occur. The formula for the expected number of double-dimers is (p * q), where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation type. However, in this case, it seems like we're dealing with dilutions, so we might need to calculate based on the observed plumes. \n\nWait, let's think differently. In experiments involving double-dimers, if you plate on a lawn of one strain, and the other strain is present as a selective medium, you can count the number of colonies that survive. This survival rate is related to the frequency of double-dimers. For example, if the survival rate is S, then S = (p + q - 2pq)^2, assuming independent assortment. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the number of surviving cells indicates the presence of double-dimers. \n\nIn this problem, after mixing, the total number of plumes (infections) is distributed between the two strains. Since the first half was plated on B and the second on K, and considering the original population might be equal, the distribution could indicate the frequency of double-dimers. The result shows more infections on B (40%) than on K (4%). This suggests that the double-dimers are more common among B-resistant mutants, implying a positive relationship. \n\nTo find the recombination coefficient (c), which measures the proportion of double-dimers relative to the maximum possible, we can use the formula c = \u221a(\u0394), where \u0394 is the difference in survival rates. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Another way is to use the formula for the expected number of surviving cells, which relates to the double-dimer frequency. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the frequency of the double-dimers as f. The expected number of surviving cells would be f squared times the initial number of cells. But since the exact numbers aren't given, maybe we can infer the value based on the ratio of survivors. \n\nIf the survivor rate on B is 40% and on K is 4%, perhaps the double-dimers are responsible for the difference. Let\u2019s assume that without any double-dimers, all cells would survive (100%), but with double-dimers, some don't. The observed difference suggests that the double-dimers affect the outcome. \n\nAlternatively, thinking about the Hardy-Weinberg principle, but adjusted for double-dimers. Maybe the number of double-dimers affects the survival. If the double-dimers increase the survival rate, then the observed higher survival rate on B compared to K might suggest that the double-dimers favor B. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that in such experiments, the number of surviving cells is proportional to the square of the double-dimer frequency. So if f is the double-dimer frequency, then the survival rate would be f\u00b2 * N_initial / N_plated. Without specific numbers, it's tricky, but perhaps the ratio helps us determine f. \n\nGiven that 40% survived on B and 4% on K, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the double-dimers are more prevalent in B, indicating a positive correlation. To find f, we'd take the square root of the ratio, which would give us approximately 3.16%, but since we're looking for a single letter choice, the closest option is 1%, but wait, 1% squared is 1%, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the calculation uses a different factor. \n\nAnother angle: the number of double-dimers observed can help estimate the fitness effect. The difference in survivor rates might correspond to the double-dimer frequency. Using the formula, the double-dimer frequency c can be approximated by taking the square root of the ratio of the survivor rates. Here, survivor rate on B is 40%, on K is 4%. So the ratio is 10:1. Taking the square root gives around 3.16%, which rounds to about 3%, but our options don't include 3%. The closest lower option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Hmm, but my earlier thought led me to 3%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is c \u2248 \u221a(S_B / S_K), where S_B is the survival rate on B, and S_K on K. So S_B/S_K = 10. Then c \u2248 \u221a10 \u2248 3.16%, which again is close to 3%, but not exactly an option. Looking back at the choices: F is 0.3%, which is tenfold smaller than 3. Perhaps I should reconsider whether the formula uses the reciprocal. If S_B is 40% and S_K is 4%, then the ratio is 10. The square root is ~3.16, which is roughly 3.16%, but none of the options match this. Maybe the formula is c = sqrt(S_B * S_K). Then 40% *4% = 1.6%, sqrt of that is ~1.26%, which is closest to 1%, option A. But I'm not sure if this formula is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the double-dimers as the difference between the observed and expected plumes. On B, 40% survived, and on K, 4%. Assuming that the baseline without double-dimers is 50%, then the difference suggests that double-dimers reduce survival. But without precise counts, it's challenging. Given the answer choices, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of double-dimers leads to a certain survival rate. \n\nConsidering the high number of double-dimers on B, which is 40%, while fewer on K, suggesting that the double-dimers are more common on B. The recombination coefficient c would measure the likelihood of these mutations occurring together. If the double-dimers are frequent on B, it implies a positive recombination, meaning the mutations are linked. The exact calculation would involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation and their interaction, but without that data, we might have to infer based on the observed distribution.\n\nGiven the answer choices, and recognizing that 3% is close to option G (0.5%) and F (0.3%), and considering that the double-dimers may be around 1% frequency, the closest option is F (0.3%). But I'm still uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the double-dimers lead to increased survival, and using the formula c = 1 - (S_B + S_K)/2. Plugging in S_B=40% and S_K=4%, we get (40+4)/2=22%, so c\u224878%. That doesn't make sense, so maybe that formula isn't applicable here.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the observed plumes represent the double-dimers. If 40% survived on B and 4% on K, the number of double-dimers must explain why B has more survivors. The exact calculation requires knowing the double-dimer frequency, which might be derived from the ratio of survivors. Assuming that the double-dimer frequency is x, then the survival rate on B is x\u00b2*(initial cells)/plated cells. But without the initial cell count, it's hard to compute x directly. However, we can approximate that the ratio of survivors on B to K is 10:1, suggesting that the double-dimers are more common on B. \n\nGiven the answer choices, and considering that 1% corresponds to a low recombination coefficient, but perhaps closer to 1% being too low, whereas 0.3% is even lower. However, without precise calculations, I might lean towards option F (0.3%) as the most plausible answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Hmm, I think I might have gotten confused here. Let me try again.\n\nWhen the phages infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes the problem. So if both mutantphages are present, some might combine their effects somehow. But when they're both present, the E. coli B shows that only the lysogenic phage does damage. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a dominant effect, meaning that the mutation causing damage isn't being recombined with another mutation. Alternatively, if the mutations recombine, then perhaps only some of the phages would cause damage, leading to a lower number of plumes on strain B than expected without recombination.\n\nThe experiment divides the bacteria into two groups. One group is more diluted (1:10^7), which should be harder for the phages to infect. The other group is less diluted (1:10^5), easier to infect. They plate these on the respective bacterial strains. If there was no recombination, you'd expect both groups to show similar patterns because the presence of either mutation shouldn't affect the outcome much. However, in this case, the E. coli B shows fewer plumes (40 instead of 40?), wait, no, the numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. Wait, that seems odd. Let me check the original data:\n\n\"Other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because if you dilute it more, it's harder to get enough phages to infect, so fewer plumes. But in this case, the E. coli B group had 40 plumes, while the K group had 4. That doesn't make sense because the K group was treated with a less dilute solution, meaning more phages could infect. So why did the K group have fewer plumes?\n\nMaybe the issue is about whether the phage was lysogenic or not. If the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect, then the K group, being treated with a higher dilution, would have more infections, hence more plumes. But the K group only had 4, while B had 40. That's inconsistent unless recombination occurred.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage, making it less likely to infect, thus reducing the number of plumes. For example, if some of the phages recombine, they become wild-type and don't cause damage, whereas others remain lysogenic. So if recombination occurs at a rate 'r', then the fraction of phages that are resistant becomes r, and the rest are susceptible.\n\nIn the experiment, the K group (treated with less dilution) showed fewer plumes (only 4) compared to B (treated with higher dilution, 40). This suggests that the presence of recombination reduced the number of effective lysogenic phages, leading to fewer successful infections. \n\nThe formula to calculate the expected number of plumes would involve the dilution factor and the probability of recombination. The expected number of plumes on strain B (with high dilution) would be proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Similarly, on strain K (lower dilution), it would be higher because more phages are present, so the expectation would be (1 + r) or something like that. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive recombination, it's reduced in proportion. Suppose the recombination rate is r, meaning that r% of the phages are now wild-type. Then, the effective fraction of lysogenic phages would decrease by r. So, on strain B, which was treated with higher dilution, the number of successful infections would be (1 - r) times the expected. On strain K, treated with lower dilution, the number would be (1 + r) times the expected, because more phages are present, so the survival rate increases.\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\nPlumes_B = (1 - r) * N\n\nPlumes_K = (1 + r) * N\n\nBut from the experiment, Plumes_B = 40 and Plumes_K = 4. Let's assume N is the same for both, just the number of phages plated. So,\n\n40 = (1 - r) * N\n\n4 = (1 + r) * N\n\nDividing the first equation by the second gives:\n\n(1 - r)/(1 + r) = 40/4 = 10\n\nSo,\n\n1 - r = 10*(1 + r)\n\n1 - r = 10 + 10r\n\nBringing terms together:\n\n1 - 10 = 10r + r\n\n-9 = 11r\n\nr \u2248 -9/11 \u2248 -0.818\n\nWait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense because recombination rates are positive. Maybe I set up the equations wrong. Perhaps the plumes should be inversely related to the dilution factors. Let's rethink.\n\nActually, the expected number of plumes should be proportional to the dilution factor multiplied by the recombination rate. Let me denote the dilution factors as d_B = 1e7 and d_K = 1e5. The expected number of plumes would be:\n\nPlumes_B = k * d_B * (1 - r)\n\nPlumes_K = k * d_K * (1 + r)\n\nWhere k is a constant that includes all other factors like efficiency of phage production, etc.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n40 = k * 1e7 * (1 - r)\n\n4 = k * 1e5 * (1 + r)\n\nLet me divide the first equation by the second to eliminate k:\n\n40 / 4 = [k * 1e7 * (1 - r)] / [k * 1e5 * (1 + r)]\n\n10 = (1e7 / 1e5) * [(1 - r)/(1 + r)]\n\n10 = 100 * [(1 - r)/(1 + r)]\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n0.1 = (1 - r)/(1 + r)\n\nNow solve for r:\n\n0.1*(1 + r) = 1 - r\n\n0.1 + 0.1r = 1 - r\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n0.1r + r = 1 - 0.1\n\n1.1r = 0.9\n\nr = 0.9 / 1.1 \u2248 0.818 or approximately 81.8%\n\nWait, that's way too high. Recombination rates in phage genomes are typically very low, usually around 0.01%. But getting 81.8% seems impossible. Did I mess up the setup?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the dilution factors. Maybe Plumes_B corresponds to d_B and Plumes_K to d_K, so the ratio is Plumes_B / Plumes_K = (d_B / d_K) * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = (1e7 / 1e5) * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\n10 = 100 * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\nSame as before, leading to r\u224881.8%, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, clearly I'm missing something. Maybe the formula needs adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plasmids or the probability differently. Another thought: if the lysogenic phage is not recombining, then the E. coli B (which only gets lysogenic phages) would have a certain number of plumes. If some do recombine, those phages become wild-type and don't cause damage. So the total number of plumes would depend on how many phages are effectively lysogenic.\n\nLet me model it as follows: suppose the total number of phages is P. Without any recombination, all phages are lysogenic, so E. coli B gets all P phages, leading to P plumes. With recombination, some fraction r of the phages are wild-type, so E. coli B only gets (1 - r)*P phages, resulting in (1 - r)*P plumes. Similarly, E. coli K, which was treated with a higher dilution (so more phages), would receive (1 + r)*P plumes because more phages are present, and assuming all are lysogenic, but wait, no\u2014actually, if some recombine, then some are wild-type, so the effective lysogenic fraction decreases, increasing the chance of infection.\n\nWait, maybe I should frame it in terms of probabilities. Let\u2019s say that without recombination, the probability of a phage infecting E. coli B is p. With recombination, the probability that a phage remains lysogenic is q, so the probability of infection is q*p.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate is small, q \u2248 1 - r, where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes on B would be (q/p) * (number of phages plated on B). Similarly, on K, since more phages are present, the expected number would be ((1 + r)/p) * (number of phages plated on K).\n\nGiven that, let's define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote N_B as the number of phages plated on B, and N_K as the number on K. From the experiment, N_B = 1e7 phages (since the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning 1e7 phages were plated per microliter). Similarly, N_K = 1e5.\n\nWithout recombination, the expected plumes on B would be N_B * (probability of infection). Assuming that the probability of infection is the same for both, then the ratio of plumes on B and K would be proportional to the ratio of phages plated, adjusted by the probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, the probability of infection is the same for both bacteria. Therefore, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to N_B * p, and on K proportional to N_K * p. Since N_K > N_B, and the observed plumes on K are fewer, this implies that the effective probability of infection on K is lower, implying that recombination increased the probability of failure (i.e., wild-type phages infecting E. coli K).\n\nWait, that makes sense. If some recombination happens, the lysogenic phages become wild-type, which cannot infect E. coli K. Therefore, the probability of infection on K decreases, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B is equal to the ratio of their effective probabilities of infection.\n\nSo,\n\nPlumes_K / Plumes_B = (Probability_K) / (Probability_B) = (N_K * q) / (N_B * p) ) = (N_K / N_B) * (q / p )\n\nWe know that Plumes_K = 4 and Plumes_B = 40, so 4/40 = 1/10 = (N_K / N_B) * (q / p )\n\nN_K / N_B = 1e5 / 1e7 = 1/100\n\nThus,\n\n1/10 = (1/100) * (q / p )\n\nSolving for q/p:\n\n(q / p ) = (1/10) / (1/100) = 10\n\nSince q = 1 - r, and assuming p is the same for both, then q/p = 10 => (1 - r)/p = 10*(p / p )=10.\n\nWait, but that would imply that (1 - r)/p = 10, meaning 1 - r = 10p. But without knowing p, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps p is negligible, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, if p is the same for both, then:\n\nq/p = 10 \u21d2 (1 - r)/p = 10 \u21d2 (1 - r) = 10p\n\nBut without knowing p, this approach might not work. Maybe I should express everything in terms of r.\n\nLet me consider that without recombination, the probability of infection is the same for both. Let\u2019s denote the probability of a phage infecting E. coli as p.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So four plumes mean four successful infections, and 40 means 40 unsuccessful ones? Or maybe it's different because the dilution affects the probability. Hmm, I think I might have gotten confused here. Let me try again.\n\nWhen the phages infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes the problem. So if both mutantphages are present, some might combine their effects somehow. But when they're both present, the E. coli B shows that only the lysogenic phage does damage. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has a dominant effect, meaning that the mutation causing damage isn't being recombined with another mutation. Alternatively, if the mutations recombine, then perhaps only some of the phages would cause damage, leading to a lower number of plumes on strain B than expected without recombination.\n\nThe experiment divides the bacteria into two groups. One group is more diluted (1:10^7), which should be harder for the phages to infect. The other group is less diluted (1:10^5), easier to infect. They plate these on the respective bacterial strains. If there was no recombination, you'd expect both groups to show similar patterns because the presence of either mutation shouldn't affect the outcome much. However, in this case, the E. coli B shows fewer plumes (40 instead of 40?), wait, no, the numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. Wait, that seems odd. Let me check the original data:\n\n\"Other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because if you dilute it more, it's harder to get enough phages to infect, so fewer plumes. But in this case, the E. coli B group had 40 plumes, while the K group had 4. That doesn't make sense because the K group was treated with a less dilute solution, meaning more phages could infect. So why did the K group have fewer plumes?\n\nMaybe the issue is about whether the phage was lysogenic or not. If the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect, then the K group, being treated with a higher dilution, would have more infections, hence more plumes. But the K group only had 4, while B had 40. That's inconsistent unless recombination occurred.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage, making it less likely to infect, thus reducing the number of plumes. For example, if some of the phages recombine, they become wild-type and don't cause damage, whereas others remain lysogenic. So if recombination occurs at a rate 'r', then the fraction of phages that are resistant becomes r, and the rest are susceptible.\n\nIn the experiment, the K group (treated with less dilution) showed fewer plumes (only 4) compared to B (treated with higher dilution, 40). This suggests that the presence of recombination reduced the number of effective lysogenic phages, leading to fewer successful infections. \n\nThe formula to calculate the expected number of plumes would involve the dilution factor and the probability of recombination. The expected number of plumes on strain B (with high dilution) would be proportional to (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Similarly, on strain K (lower dilution), it would be higher because more phages are present, so the expectation would be (1 + r) or something like that. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive recombination, it's reduced in proportion. Suppose the recombination rate is r, meaning that r% of the phages are now wild-type. Then, the effective fraction of lysogenic phages would decrease by r. So, on strain B, which was treated with higher dilution, the number of successful infections would be (1 - r) times the expected. On strain K, treated with lower dilution, the number would be (1 + r) times the expected, because more phages are present, so the survival rate increases.\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\nPlumes_B = (1 - r) * N\n\nPlumes_K = (1 + r) * N\n\nBut from the experiment, Plumes_B = 40 and Plumes_K = 4. Let's assume N is the same for both, just the number of phages plated. So,\n\n40 = (1 - r) * N\n\n4 = (1 + r) * N\n\nDividing the first equation by the second gives:\n\n(1 - r)/(1 + r) = 40/4 = 10\n\nSo,\n\n1 - r = 10*(1 + r)\n\n1 - r = 10 + 10r\n\nBringing terms together:\n\n1 - 10 = 10r + r\n\n-9 = 11r\n\nr \u2248 -9/11 \u2248 -0.818\n\nWait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense because recombination rates are positive. Maybe I set up the equations wrong. Perhaps the plumes should be inversely related to the dilution factors. Let's rethink.\n\nActually, the expected number of plumes should be proportional to the dilution factor multiplied by the recombination rate. Let me denote the dilution factors as d_B = 1e7 and d_K = 1e5. The expected number of plumes would be:\n\nPlumes_B = k * d_B * (1 - r)\n\nPlumes_K = k * d_K * (1 + r)\n\nWhere k is a constant that includes all other factors like efficiency of phage production, etc.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n40 = k * 1e7 * (1 - r)\n\n4 = k * 1e5 * (1 + r)\n\nLet me divide the first equation by the second to eliminate k:\n\n40 / 4 = [k * 1e7 * (1 - r)] / [k * 1e5 * (1 + r)]\n\n10 = (1e7 / 1e5) * [(1 - r)/(1 + r)]\n\n10 = 100 * [(1 - r)/(1 + r)]\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n0.1 = (1 - r)/(1 + r)\n\nNow solve for r:\n\n0.1*(1 + r) = 1 - r\n\n0.1 + 0.1r = 1 - r\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n0.1r + r = 1 - 0.1\n\n1.1r = 0.9\n\nr = 0.9 / 1.1 \u2248 0.818 or approximately 81.8%\n\nWait, that's way too high. Recombination rates in phage genomes are typically very low, usually around 0.01%. But getting 81.8% seems impossible. Did I mess up the setup?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the dilution factors. Maybe Plumes_B corresponds to d_B and Plumes_K to d_K, so the ratio is Plumes_B / Plumes_K = (d_B / d_K) * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = (1e7 / 1e5) * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\n10 = 100 * ((1 - r)/(1 + r))\n\nSame as before, leading to r\u224881.8%, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, clearly I'm missing something. Maybe the formula needs adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plasmids or the probability differently. Another thought: if the lysogenic phage is not recombining, then the E. coli B (which only gets lysogenic phages) would have a certain number of plumes. If some do recombine, those phages become wild-type and don't cause damage. So the total number of plumes would depend on how many phages are effectively lysogenic.\n\nLet me model it as follows: suppose the total number of phages is P. Without any recombination, all phages are lysogenic, so E. coli B gets all P phages, leading to P plumes. With recombination, some fraction r of the phages are wild-type, so E. coli B only gets (1 - r)*P phages, resulting in (1 - r)*P plumes. Similarly, E. coli K, which was treated with a higher dilution (so more phages), would receive (1 + r)*P plumes because more phages are present, and assuming all are lysogenic, but wait, no\u2014actually, if some recombine, then some are wild-type, so the effective lysogenic fraction decreases, increasing the chance of infection.\n\nWait, maybe I should frame it in terms of probabilities. Let\u2019s say that without recombination, the probability of a phage infecting E. coli B is p. With recombination, the probability that a phage remains lysogenic is q, so the probability of infection is q*p.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate is small, q \u2248 1 - r, where r is the recombination frequency.\n\nThen, the expected number of plumes on B would be (q/p) * (number of phages plated on B). Similarly, on K, since more phages are present, the expected number would be ((1 + r)/p) * (number of phages plated on K).\n\nGiven that, let's define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote N_B as the number of phages plated on B, and N_K as the number on K. From the experiment, N_B = 1e7 phages (since the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning 1e7 phages were plated per microliter). Similarly, N_K = 1e5.\n\nWithout recombination, the expected plumes on B would be N_B * (probability of infection). Assuming that the probability of infection is the same for both, then the ratio of plumes on B and K would be proportional to the ratio of phages plated, adjusted by the probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, the probability of infection is the same for both bacteria. Therefore, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to N_B * p, and on K proportional to N_K * p. Since N_K > N_B, and the observed plumes on K are fewer, this implies that the effective probability of infection on K is lower, implying that recombination increased the probability of failure (i.e., wild-type phages infecting E. coli K).\n\nWait, that makes sense. If some recombination happens, the lysogenic phages become wild-type, which cannot infect E. coli K. Therefore, the probability of infection on K decreases, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B is equal to the ratio of their effective probabilities of infection.\n\nSo,\n\nPlumes_K / Plumes_B = (Probability_K) / (Probability_B) = (N_K * q) / (N_B * p) ) = (N_K / N_B) * (q / p )\n\nWe know that Plumes_K = 4 and Plumes_B = 40, so 4/40 = 1/10 = (N_K / N_B) * (q / p )\n\nN_K / N_B = 1e5 / 1e7 = 1/100\n\nThus,\n\n1/10 = (1/100) * (q / p )\n\nSolving for q/p:\n\n(q / p ) = (1/10) / (1/100) = 10\n\nSince q = 1 - r, and assuming p is the same for both, then q/p = 10 => (1 - r)/p = 10*(p / p )=10.\n\nWait, but that would imply that (1 - r)/p = 10, meaning 1 - r = 10p. But without knowing p, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps p is negligible, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, if p is the same for both, then:\n\nq/p = 10 \u21d2 (1 - r)/p = 10 \u21d2 (1 - r) = 10p\n\nBut without knowing p, this approach might not work. Maybe I should express everything in terms of r.\n\nLet me consider that without recombination, the probability of infection is the same for both. Let\u2019s denote the probability of a phage infecting E. coli as p. Then, the number of plumes on B would be N_B * p, and on K, N_K * p.\n\nHowever, due to recombination, some phages become wild-type, so their probability of infecting E. coli K is zero. Thus, the actual probability of infection on K is q * p, where q </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Typically, when you plate a strain, if enough phages replicate, you'll see a certain number of plumes. Here, for strain B, 40 plumes suggest high replication, implying good compatibility. For strain K, 4 plumes mean low replication. But wait, in this case, the phages are either lysogenic or non-lytic. If the phages cause lysogenic fission, they should integrate into the host genome, leading to higher replication rates. Conversely, non-lytic phages would cause lytic fission, leading to lower replication. \n\nSo when both types are present, the ones causing lysogenic fission should integrate more effectively, leading to higher numbers of phages replicating within the bacteria. That would explain why the B strain has many plumes (40), indicating good compatibility, whereas the K strain has few (4). \n\nNow, the question is about recombination. Recombination refers to how different genes from two different phages interact within a single phage. In this context, it's likely referring to the integration of the two mutations into the same T_4 phage. If the phages share a mutation (like a prophage or a transgene), they will integrate together, increasing their activity. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both types are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to better compatibility (more plumes on B), suggesting that the phages can coexist without much issue. However, the presence of the non-lytic phage reduces compatibility (fewer plumes on K). This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrates more readily than the non-lytic one, possibly due to a shared mutation allowing both to integrate effectively. \n\nTo determine the recombination rate, I think we're looking at how often the two mutations occurred in the same phage. Since the phages are being tested as separate mutants, any chance that both mutations occurred in the same phage would contribute to recombination. \n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of successful replications depends on whether both mutations integrated into the same phage or were independent. If the two mutations occurred independently, the number of successful plasmids would depend on each mutation's effectiveness. However, if they occur together (recombine), the phage would have a single version of both mutations, making it easier for both to replicate. \n\nGiven that the B strain had many plumes (good compatibility), and K had few (poor compatibility), the fact that both types are present indicates that they might recombine. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful integrations. \n\nIf we assume that the expected outcome without recombination is that all phages integrate once, then with recombination, each phage could integrate both mutations. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the presence of both types suggests that there was recombination, and the number of plumes reflects the number of successful integrations. \n\nSince the results show that both types lead to different outcomes (B having many, K few), it implies that the mutations integrated into different phages. Therefore, recombination occurs, meaning that both mutations occurred in the same phage. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. To calculate this, I might consider the number of times both mutations occurred in the same phage relative to the total possible combinations. \n\nBut another approach is to use the formula for recombinant frequency, which is calculated based on the number of recombinant offspring compared to the total. In this case, the total plumes are 44 (40 on B and 4 on K). The number of recombinants would correspond to the number of plumes where both mutations occurred in the same phage, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of both types suggests some level of recombination, but without knowing the exact distribution, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants causes the E. coli to be partially cleared (since only B is worse), it suggests that they can coexist, implying recombination. The specific percentages given in the options suggest that the recombination rate is low. \n\nLooking back, the answer choices range from 0.01% to 5%.

Similarly, 4 on K mean 4 were lysed by strain K phages.\n\nNow, considering the initial dilution: 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. So on the B lawn, the number of phages is higher because each bacterium has more phages available (since the concentration is lower, meaning fewer phages per bacterium). Conversely, on the K lawn, the concentration is higher because the same number of phages are spread over fewer bacteria (lower dilution), leading to more phages per bacterium. \n\nThe presence of 40 plumes on B suggests that many more phages from B have been detected than those from K. Since the phages from K are at a higher concentration, their effect might be less noticeable unless their replication is efficient enough to cause more infections. However, the fact that there are more plumes on B despite the higher concentration could indicate that the phages from B are being replicated more efficiently, leading to more plumes upon dilution. Alternatively, maybe the phages from K are causing the division of the phage particles, thus reducing the number of new infections. But wait, when you dilute the phage, you're increasing the chance of multiple infections. If the phages from K are more numerous, even in a diluted sample, they might have a harder time replicating before entering the lysosome because they are in a higher concentration.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the two mutation types are present simultaneously in the same bacteria. So during the experiment, when the phage population is diluted, the presence of phage mutants increases the likelihood of them infecting the bacteria. Since the phage mutants are present, the number of phages in the environment is higher, which would increase the probability of plasmid duplication or other effects. But how does this relate to the recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic information within a phage particle. In phages, this often happens during the process of lysis, where the phage's DNA incorporates parts of its own genome. The efficiency of this process depends on factors like the quality of the phage-DNA hybridization complex and the ability of the phage to replicate. The degree of recombination affects whether a phage will lyse (and die) or lyse and then integrate into another phage.\n\nIn the experiment, the two mutation types (mutant A and mutant B) are causing different outcomes. Only mutant B causes death of the E. coli. This suggests that mutant B is causing a lysogenic infection, while mutant A may be causing a different outcome. However, the presence of both mutations leads to the death of E. coli strain B, indicating that they interact somehow.\n\nWhen the phages are present, the presence of two different mutants likely affects their replication and the subsequent infection. If the phages are more prone to duplications due to recombination, this might lead to more efficient lysogeny. But I'm trying to connect this to the experimental results.\n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the recombination occurred between the two mutations. The experiment shows that when the phages are present, there are more plumes on B despite the higher concentration of phages. This suggests that the phages from B are more effective at causing lysogeny, perhaps because they have undergone more recombination with the host genome. Alternatively, the presence of more phages from K might reduce the effectiveness of B's phages because they are more numerous, making it harder for B's phages to find new targets.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the amount of recombination. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinations) / (Total Number of Possible Recombinations)\n\nHowever, in this context, the plume counts can be used as a proxy. Each plume represents an infection event. If there are more plumes on B, it suggests that B's phages are more successful in lysing the E. coli. The presence of both mutants suggests that some recombination has happened, but the exact calculation requires knowing the expected recombination frequency given the observed data.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in plume counts can be related to the relative efficiency of the phages. For example, if the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, it suggests that B's phages are ten times as effective as K's in causing lysogeny. This could imply a high level of recombination.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can consider the logarithmic scale.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 40 plumes on B, that means 40 bacteria were lysed by phages from strain B. Similarly, 4 on K mean 4 were lysed by strain K phages.\n\nNow, considering the initial dilution: 1:10^7 for B and 1:10^5 for K. So on the B lawn, the number of phages is higher because each bacterium has more phages available (since the concentration is lower, meaning fewer phages per bacterium). Conversely, on the K lawn, the concentration is higher because the same number of phages are spread over fewer bacteria (lower dilution), leading to more phages per bacterium. \n\nThe presence of 40 plumes on B suggests that many more phages from B have been detected than those from K. Since the phages from K are at a higher concentration, their effect might be less noticeable unless their replication is efficient enough to cause more infections. However, the fact that there are more plumes on B despite the higher concentration could indicate that the phages from B are being replicated more efficiently, leading to more plumes upon dilution. Alternatively, maybe the phages from K are causing the division of the phage particles, thus reducing the number of new infections. But wait, when you dilute the phage, you're increasing the chance of multiple infections. If the phages from K are more numerous, even in a diluted sample, they might have a harder time replicating before entering the lysosome because they are in a higher concentration.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the two mutation types are present simultaneously in the same bacteria. So during the experiment, when the phage population is diluted, the presence of phage mutants increases the likelihood of them infecting the bacteria. Since the phage mutants are present, the number of phages in the environment is higher, which would increase the probability of plasmid duplication or other effects. But how does this relate to the recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic information within a phage particle. In phages, this often happens during the process of lysis, where the phage's DNA incorporates parts of its own genome. The efficiency of this process depends on factors like the quality of the phage-DNA hybridization complex and the ability of the phage to replicate. The degree of recombination affects whether a phage will lyse (and die) or lyse and then integrate into another phage.\n\nIn the experiment, the two mutation types (mutant A and mutant B) are causing different outcomes. Only mutant B causes death of the E. coli. This suggests that mutant B is causing a lysogenic infection, while mutant A may be causing a different outcome. However, the presence of both mutations leads to the death of E. coli strain B, indicating that they interact somehow.\n\nWhen the phages are present, the presence of two different mutants likely affects their replication and the subsequent infection. If the phages are more prone to duplications due to recombination, this might lead to more efficient lysogeny. But I'm trying to connect this to the experimental results.\n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the recombination occurred between the two mutations. The experiment shows that when the phages are present, there are more plumes on B despite the higher concentration of phages. This suggests that the phages from B are more effective at causing lysogeny, perhaps because they have undergone more recombination with the host genome. Alternatively, the presence of more phages from K might reduce the effectiveness of B's phages because they are more numerous, making it harder for B's phages to find new targets.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the amount of recombination. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinations) / (Total Number of Possible Recombinations)\n\nHowever, in this context, the plume counts can be used as a proxy.

Given that the plume count ratio is around 10:1, this aligns with option A (1%) or F (0.3%). \n\nWait, let's double-check. The ratio is 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, which is 10:1. The logarithm base 10 of 10 is 1, suggesting a 1% recombination frequency. That matches option A (1%).\n\nSo the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "rollout": " So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 E. coli from the K culture have been lysed by the phages.\n\nWait, no, actually, each plate has many cells. So if you dilute the phages, the number of cells you're testing increases. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution would mean 10^7 phages per mL, so in a sample, say, you plate, say, 1 mL, you'd get 10^7 phages. But for the purpose of counting, the dilution factor affects how many cells you test. So if you have a 1:10^7 dilution, you're effectively looking at 10^7 cells. Similarly, 1:10^5 would be 10^5 cells.\n\nSo, in the first case, half the bacteria (let's say N/2) were plated on strain B, and the other half (N/2) were plated on strain K. Each half was further diluted. So, the number of cells tested depends on the dilution factor. If N is the total population, then the number of cells tested would be N/2 * dilution factor.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the ratio of plumes observed. Since the same phages are used on both strains, any recombination would lead to different patterns of infection. However, in this case, all the plasmids from the lysogenic phage caused die, so when they were plated on strain B, those should kill all the cells, right? But here, the majority of the cells died on strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, but perhaps the lysogenic phage also had a mutation causing it to interact with another type of phage?\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B but does so for strain K. So when the lysogenic phage is present, it lyses strain B and doesn't affect strain K. But in the experiment, both types are present, and the result is that half of the colonies are affected more than the other half. That suggests some kind of interaction where the presence of both phages leads to different outcomes.\n\nLet me think about the expected results without any recombination. Normally, the lysogenic phage would cause all the cells to be lysed, leading to complete death. The lytic phage would lyse the cell, leaving no survivors. But in this case, we see that half the colonies are partially lysed, and the other half are fully lysed. This indicates that there's some recombination happening between the two mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, the outcome isn't as straightforward as just one being dominant over the other. It seems like the presence of one type of phage affects the replication of the other. Specifically, the lysogenic phage might be causing the lytic phage to replicate more efficiently or vice versa. Alternatively, the mutations could be causing the phages to form dimers or higher-order structures, leading to interference in each other's replication.\n\nThe key here is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the interaction between the two genes involved in the mutation. In this case, the two mutations are in the T_4 phage, specifically in regions that cause the lysogenic and lytic effects.\n\nWhen the two phages interfere with each other's replication, they produce double-stranded DNA fragments. These can sometimes block the replication of one phage on the host, leading to incomplete lysis. The degree of recombination can be estimated by analyzing the pattern of plumes. If the phages are completely independent, you'd expect some random distribution. However, if there's partial interference, you'd see clusters or specific patterns.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, 40 plumes are found, and on strain K, 4 are found. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the same sample is being plated on both strains. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that were lysed. If the lysogenic phage is effective against strain B but not strain K, then when you plate on strain B, the lysogenic phage would kill the cells, resulting in no plumes. But instead, you're seeing 40 plumes on strain B, meaning 40 cells were lysed. Similarly, 4 plumes on strain K suggest 4 cells were lysed there.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage is active against both, why would some be lysed and others not? That doesn't add up unless there's some interaction. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both phages leads to competition in their replication, causing some to be killed more easily by one phage than the other. If the lysogenic phage is less effective against strain K, it might dominate, killing more cells, while the lytic phage kills fewer.\n\nBut given that the results show both plumes occurring on both strains, it must be due to some interference between the two mutations. The exact calculation requires knowing the number of recombinant events relative to the total possible. \n\nIn experiments like this, the number of plumes can indicate the level of interference. The formula for calculating the percentage of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = (number of recombinant plumes / total number of plumes) \u00d7 100%\n\nAssuming that the total number of plumes is the sum of plumes from both strains, R would be (40 + 4) / (40 + 40) \u00d7 100% = 44 / 80 \u00d7 100% = 55%. But that's way too high, so I must be misapplying the concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the effectiveness. If 4 plumes occur on strain K, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is interfering with the replication of the lytic phage on strain K, leading to fewer infections there. Conversely, 40 plumes on strain B indicate that the lysogenic phage is not interfering as much there.\n\nThe percentage of recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (plumes observed in one strain - expected plumes) / (expected plumes)\n\nWhere expected plumes would be if there were no recombination, i.e., if the lysogenic phage was effective on one strain but not the other. However, without more data, it's tricky. Another approach is to consider that the observed number of plumes is influenced by the level of interference. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would be less than expected if there were no recombination. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage doesn't interfere on K, it would cause more plumes on K. \n\nGiven that on K, only 4 plumes are observed, compared to 40 on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is interfering more on K than on B. The difference in plume counts reflects the level of recombination. \n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nR = [(plumes on K - plumes on B) / (plumes on K + plumes on B)] \u00d7 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) = (-36)/44 \u2248 -0.818, which gives approximately -81.8%, but since percentages are positive, we take the absolute value. However, this negative result doesn't make sense because recombination cannot be negative. \n\nThis approach might not be correct. Instead, let's think in terms of the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the number of recombinant plumes would be low. Given that we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause recombination on K than on B.\n\nAnother method is to consider that the number of plumes observed is related to the efficiency of each phage's replication. If the lysogenic phage is effective on B but not on K, the proportion of plumes on K will reflect the efficiency of interference. \n\nThe formula for estimating the percentage of recombination (R%) is:\n\nR% = (100 \u00d7 (plumes on K)) / (plumes on K + plumes on B))\n\nWhich would give us (100 \u00d7 4) / (4 + 40) = 400 / 44 \u2248 9.09%. But this still doesn't match the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes relates to the number of interactions or recombinants, perhaps the formula is:\n\nR% = (plumes on K - plumes on B) / (total plumes)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) = (-36)/44 \u2248 -81.8%. Taking absolute value gives 81.8%, but again, this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match this calculation. The closest option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). However, my calculations don't align with these. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the percentage of recombination can be determined by the ratio of the plumes observed.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would decrease. The decrease in plumes can be attributed to the level of recombination. To estimate the percentage of recombination, we can compare the observed plumes to the expected plumes if there was no interference.\n\nExpected plumes without interference would be equal for both strains. However, with interference, the lysogenic phage affects one strain more than the other. \n\nThe formula to calculate the percentage of recombination is:\n\nR% = (plumes on K - plumes on B) / (plumes on K + plumes on B) \u00d7 100%\n\nSo, plugging in the values: (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) \u00d7 100% = (-36)/44 \u00d7 100% \u2248 -81.8%\n\nTaking the absolute value, we get 81.8%, which is not among the options.

If the lysogenic phage causes interference, the percentage of recombination is inversely related to the number of plumes observed. \n\nWait, another idea: If the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain K, the number of plumes on K is lower. The difference between plumes on K and B can indicate the recombination rate. So, (plumes on K - plumes on B) / (plumes on K + plumes on B) \u00d7 100% = (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) \u00d7 100% \u2248 -81.8%. The absolute value is 81.8%, which is still not an option. \n\nGiven this, I think I might have misunderstood the experiment's design. Perhaps the ratio of plumes observed is indicative of the level of interference. If the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would be lower. The percentage of recombination can be approximated by the ratio of plumes. \n\nFor instance, if the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would be roughly proportional to the square root of the number of plumes on B plus the number on K. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage of recombination is simply the ratio of plumes on K to the total plumes, times 100.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means 4 E. coli from the K culture have been lysed by the phages.\n\nWait, no, actually, each plate has many cells. So if you dilute the phages, the number of cells you're testing increases. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution would mean 10^7 phages per mL, so in a sample, say, you plate, say, 1 mL, you'd get 10^7 phages. But for the purpose of counting, the dilution factor affects how many cells you test. So if you have a 1:10^7 dilution, you're effectively looking at 10^7 cells. Similarly, 1:10^5 would be 10^5 cells.\n\nSo, in the first case, half the bacteria (let's say N/2) were plated on strain B, and the other half (N/2) were plated on strain K. Each half was further diluted. So, the number of cells tested depends on the dilution factor. If N is the total population, then the number of cells tested would be N/2 * dilution factor.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the ratio of plumes observed. Since the same phages are used on both strains, any recombination would lead to different patterns of infection. However, in this case, all the plasmids from the lysogenic phage caused die, so when they were plated on strain B, those should kill all the cells, right? But here, the majority of the cells died on strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage was effective against strain B, but perhaps the lysogenic phage also had a mutation causing it to interact with another type of phage?\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B but does so for strain K. So when the lysogenic phage is present, it lyses strain B and doesn't affect strain K. But in the experiment, both types are present, and the result is that half of the colonies are affected more than the other half. That suggests some kind of interaction where the presence of both phages leads to different outcomes.\n\nLet me think about the expected results without any recombination. Normally, the lysogenic phage would cause all the cells to be lysed, leading to complete death. The lytic phage would lyse the cell, leaving no survivors. But in this case, we see that half the colonies are partially lysed, and the other half are fully lysed. This indicates that there's some recombination happening between the two mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, the outcome isn't as straightforward as just one being dominant over the other. It seems like the presence of one type of phage affects the replication of the other. Specifically, the lysogenic phage might be causing the lytic phage to replicate more efficiently or vice versa. Alternatively, the mutations could be causing the phages to form dimers or higher-order structures, leading to interference in each other's replication.\n\nThe key here is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the interaction between the two genes involved in the mutation. In this case, the two mutations are in the T_4 phage, specifically in regions that cause the lysogenic and lytic effects.\n\nWhen the two phages interfere with each other's replication, they produce double-stranded DNA fragments. These can sometimes block the replication of one phage on the host, leading to incomplete lysis. The degree of recombination can be estimated by analyzing the pattern of plumes. If the phages are completely independent, you'd expect some random distribution. However, if there's partial interference, you'd see clusters or specific patterns.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, 40 plumes are found, and on strain K, 4 are found. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the same sample is being plated on both strains. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that were lysed. If the lysogenic phage is effective against strain B but not strain K, then when you plate on strain B, the lysogenic phage would kill the cells, resulting in no plumes. But instead, you're seeing 40 plumes on strain B, meaning 40 cells were lysed. Similarly, 4 plumes on strain K suggest 4 cells were lysed there.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage is active against both, why would some be lysed and others not? That doesn't add up unless there's some interaction. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both phages leads to competition in their replication, causing some to be killed more easily by one phage than the other. If the lysogenic phage is less effective against strain K, it might dominate, killing more cells, while the lytic phage kills fewer.\n\nBut given that the results show both plumes occurring on both strains, it must be due to some interference between the two mutations. The exact calculation requires knowing the number of recombinant events relative to the total possible. \n\nIn experiments like this, the number of plumes can indicate the level of interference. The formula for calculating the percentage of recombination (R) is:\n\nR = (number of recombinant plumes / total number of plumes) \u00d7 100%\n\nAssuming that the total number of plumes is the sum of plumes from both strains, R would be (40 + 4) / (40 + 40) \u00d7 100% = 44 / 80 \u00d7 100% = 55%. But that's way too high, so I must be misapplying the concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to the effectiveness. If 4 plumes occur on strain K, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is interfering with the replication of the lytic phage on strain K, leading to fewer infections there. Conversely, 40 plumes on strain B indicate that the lysogenic phage is not interfering as much there.\n\nThe percentage of recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (plumes observed in one strain - expected plumes) / (expected plumes)\n\nWhere expected plumes would be if there were no recombination, i.e., if the lysogenic phage was effective on one strain but not the other. However, without more data, it's tricky. Another approach is to consider that the observed number of plumes is influenced by the level of interference. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would be less than expected if there were no recombination. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage doesn't interfere on K, it would cause more plumes on K. \n\nGiven that on K, only 4 plumes are observed, compared to 40 on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is interfering more on K than on B. The difference in plume counts reflects the level of recombination. \n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nR = [(plumes on K - plumes on B) / (plumes on K + plumes on B)] \u00d7 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) = (-36)/44 \u2248 -0.818, which gives approximately -81.8%, but since percentages are positive, we take the absolute value. However, this negative result doesn't make sense because recombination cannot be negative. \n\nThis approach might not be correct. Instead, let's think in terms of the probability of recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the number of recombinant plumes would be low. Given that we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause recombination on K than on B.\n\nAnother method is to consider that the number of plumes observed is related to the efficiency of each phage's replication. If the lysogenic phage is effective on B but not on K, the proportion of plumes on K will reflect the efficiency of interference. \n\nThe formula for estimating the percentage of recombination (R%) is:\n\nR% = (100 \u00d7 (plumes on K)) / (plumes on K + plumes on B))\n\nWhich would give us (100 \u00d7 4) / (4 + 40) = 400 / 44 \u2248 9.09%. But this still doesn't match the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes relates to the number of interactions or recombinants, perhaps the formula is:\n\nR% = (plumes on K - plumes on B) / (total plumes)\n\nWhich would be (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) = (-36)/44 \u2248 -81.8%. Taking absolute value gives 81.8%, but again, this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match this calculation. The closest option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). However, my calculations don't align with these. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the percentage of recombination can be determined by the ratio of the plumes observed.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes interference on strain K, the number of plumes on K would decrease. The decrease in plumes can be attributed to the level of recombination. To estimate the percentage of recombination, we can compare the observed plumes to the expected plumes if there was no interference.\n\nExpected plumes without interference would be equal for both strains. However, with interference, the lysogenic phage affects one strain more than the other. \n\nThe formula to calculate the percentage of recombination is:\n\nR% = (plumes on K - plumes on B) / (plumes on K + plumes on B) \u00d7 100%\n\nSo, plugging in the values: (4 - 40)/(4 + 40) \u00d7 100% = (-36)/44 \u00d7 100% \u2248 -81.8%\n\nTaking the absolute value, we get 81.8%, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to interpret the difference differently.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So if you have more plumes on one lawn, it means more infections there.",
    "rollout": " So if you have more plumes on one lawn, it means more infections there.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes without any recombination. If both mutation types are present, theoretically, some combination should occur. But in this case, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. That implies that the lysogenic phage isn't interacting with the lysogenic wild type, perhaps? Or maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective against the lysogenic wild type. Alternatively, maybe the two phages recombine, allowing them to work together, meaning the lysogenic phage can now infect the lysogenic wild type. If that's the case, then when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it should be able to cause lytic fission, leading to more infections than just the lysogenic phage alone.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, while the other type did. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the lysogenic wild type. Maybe the two phages are not compatible, and their recombination allows the lysogenic phage to infect the lysogenic phage, causing lytic fission. If that's true, then when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it would cause more infections, explaining why there were more plumes on K (strain B) compared to B (strain K).\n\nNow, let's consider the dilutions. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, and the second half 1:10^5. Dilution rate is important here. A higher dilution rate (like 1:10^5) means fewer potential sites for infection. However, in this case, since the lysogenic phage caused more infections on strain B (which wasn't affected), it suggests that the lysogenic phage could effectively target the lysogenic phage itself. That would happen if the two phages are compatible, meaning their genes can recombine, allowing the lysogenic phage to integrate into the lysogenic phage's genome.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes (infections) increased from what would have been expected without recombination. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would only infect the lysogenic wild type once. But with recombination, it can infect twice\u2014once as a lysogen and once as a phage within the lysogen. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain B would increase.\n\nLooking at the data: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, only 1 phage (lysogenic) would infect B, resulting in 1 plume. But with recombination, it infects twice, so 2 plumes per occurrence. Therefore, the observed number is much higher than expected. To find the recombination frequency, we can compare the ratio of observed to expected.\n\nExpected: 1 plume on B.\nObserved: 40 plumes on B.\n\nSo the ratio is 40/1 = 40 times higher than expected. This suggests a high level of recombination.\n\nHowever, the options given don't go up to 99%. Instead, the highest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach is to look at the probability of recombination. If R is the recombination frequency, then the probability that a phage will infect another phage is 2R/(1+R) when considering independent assortment. But in this context, since the phages are being used in a controlled environment, maybe it's simpler.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes when using the lysogenic phage on strain B is 2 (one as lysogen, one as phage within lysogen). However, the observed is 40, which is 20 times higher. That seems like a lot, but perhaps it's due to the high dilution rates, leading to more frequent recombination events.\n\nWait, no, the dilution rates are different. The first half is 1:10^7, and the second is 1:10^5. So the first is very dilute, making it harder for the phage to infect, whereas the second is less dilute, increasing the chance of infection.\n\nIf the two phages recombine, then the lysogenic phage can infect the lysogenic phage, leading to more infections on strain B. Since the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, which shouldn't be affected, but it is, suggesting recombination.\n\nThe observed number of plumes on B is 40, which is 40 times more than expected (without recombination, it should be 1). So the recombination must be very high.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed - Expected)/(Observed + Expected)\n\nBut I might be mixing things up. Another way is to calculate how many times more often the lysogenic phage can infect the lysogenic phage.\n\nEach time the lysogenic phage infects the lysogenic phage, it can do so either as a phage (lytic) or integrate into the lysogen (lytic fission). So the total number of plumes would be proportional to the number of times this integration occurs plus the number of times it infects independently.\n\nAssuming independence, the expected number of plumes would be 1 (as phage) plus 1 (as lysogen) = 2. However, when recombination happens, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the lysogen, so it can infect the lysogen again. So the number increases.\n\nGiven that the observed is 40 vs expected 1, the ratio is 40. So the recombination frequency must be such that the probability of recombination multiplied by the independent chances leads to this outcome.\n\nAlternatively, the observed number is much higher, suggesting a high degree of recombination. Given the answer choices, 0.5% seems too low, and 0.05% even lower. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: the expected number of plumes when using the lysogenic phage on strain B is 1 (if no recombination), but with recombination, it can also infect the lysogen, adding more plumes. So if the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogenic phage, it can infect twice, thus producing more plumes.\n\nThe number of plumes produced is proportional to the probability of recombination. If R is the recombination frequency, then the expected number of plumes would be 1 (infection as phage) plus 1 (infection as lysogen) multiplied by the probability of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the expected number of double-strand breaks, which determine whether the phage integrates. Each recombination creates a break, which upon lysis, allows the phage to integrate.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Perhaps a simpler way is to realize that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. Because if the recombination is high, more double-strand breaks, more infections.\n\nGiven that, the observed number is 40, which is 40 times the expected (1). So if N = (R)^2, then 40 = R^2 \u2192 R \u2248 sqrt(40) \u2248 6.32%, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe it's linear, so R = 40, but again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation uses the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed - Expected) / (Observed + Expected)\n\nHere, Observed = 40, Expected = 1. So R = (40-1)/(40+1) \u2248 39/41 \u2248 0.951, which is nearly complete recombination. But the options don't include 95%.\n\nThis indicates I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the observed number is 40, which is 40 times more than expected. If we take R = 40, but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the expected number of plumes when using the lysogenic phage on strain B is 1 (if no recombination). With recombination, it can infect the lysogen again, so the number increases. Since the observed is 40, which is 40 times higher, the recombination must be high.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to calculate the number of possible recombination points. For two homologous regions, the maximum number of possible recombination points is limited, but in this case, the region is small enough that most combinations are non-recombinant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of recombination. Using the formula:\n\nPercentage Recombination = ((Observed - Expected) / Expected) * 100%\n\nWhich would be ((40 - 1)/1)*100% = 3900%, which is impossible. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternative formula: Percentage Recombination = (Observed / (Expected + Observed)) * 100%\n\n= (40 / (1 + 40)) * 100% = (40/41)*100% \u2248 97.56%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the experiment. Let me read it again.\n\n\"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nWait, so when plated on strain B's lawn, only the K half is used. No, wait: the first half is labeled as \"strain B\", and the second as \"strain K\". No, actually, when plated on strain B's lawn, it's the first half. The other half is labeled as \"plated on strain K\".\n\nNo, sorry, I think I got confused earlier. The phage is taken from the first half, which is labeled as strain B (since it's the same as the original sample?), but actually, the initial sample has two types of mutants. So when they plate on strain B's lawn, they're using the phages from the first half, which were treated with the lysogenic phage, right?\n\nWait, perhaps the phage comes from the first half, which is the lysogenic phage, and is plated on strain B's lawn. Similarly, the second half is the lysogenic phage, but when plated on strain K's lawn, it shows 4 plumes on K. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the plate of strain B is infected by two types of mutantphages simultaneously. Then, the resultingly half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nSo, the phage that is used depends on the strain. If the strain is B, then the phages that are susceptible to being lysed are the lysogenic ones. If it's K, the phages that are resistant to being lysed are the lysogenic ones.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage is known to lyse E. coli, while the wild-type phage is not. So, when using the lysogenic phage on strain B, it would lyse it and cause death. On strain K, it wouldn't lyse, so it would survive.\n\nTherefore, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it would lyse all the cells, including those carrying the lysogenic phage. Thus, the number of plumes would depend on how many cells are carrying the lysogenic phage.\n\nSimilarly, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, it won't lyse, so the number of plumes would be determined by the number of cells that are free of the lysogenic phage. But since the lysogenic phage is being plated on strain K's lawn, which is resistant to its own replication, it would replicate but not lyse. So the number of plumes would correspond to the number of cells that are free of the lysogenic phage, assuming that when the lysogenic phage is plated on a strain that's resistant to it, it doesn't lyse, so the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that are free of the phage.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it would lyse all the cells, including those where the lysogenic phage is present. Therefore, every cell that contains the lysogenic phage would be lysed by the lysogenic phage, leading to a single plume per cell. So the number of plumes would equal the number of cells containing the lysogenic phage.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, it wouldn't lyse, so the lysogenic phage would replicate but not lyse. Therefore, the number of plumes would correspond to the number of cells that are free of the lysogenic phage. But since the lysogenic phage is being plated on strain K's lawn, which is resistant to its own replication, the number of plumes would reflect the number of cells without the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it causes lytic fission, leading to more plumes, while when used on strain K, it doesn't, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes is higher than when used on strain K. That suggests that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can infect both the lysogenic phage and the lysogenic phage-containing cells, leading to more plumes. Conversely, when used on strain K, it can only infect the lysogenic phage-free cells.\n\nBut in reality, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can infect all cells, including those with lysogenic phage, leading to more plumes. When used on strain K, it cannot infect the lysogenic phage, so only the lysogenic phage-free cells are affected, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes is 40, and on strain K, it's 4. Wait, that's counterintuitive because using the lysogenic phage on strain B should lead to more plumes than on strain K, which is resistant to the lysogenic phage.\n\nUnless the lysogenic phage can integrate into the lysogen, allowing it to infect the lysogen again, thereby causing more plumes. That would mean that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can both infect the lysogen and the lysogen-containing cells, leading to more plumes. Whereas when used on strain K, it can't infect the lysogen, so only the lysogen-free cells are affected, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, if the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it can infect the lysogen again, leading to more plumes. Therefore, the presence of recombination in the lysogenic phage would explain the higher number of plumes on strain B.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The observed number of plumes on strain B is 40, and the expected number is 1 (assuming no recombination). So the ratio is 40, indicating that the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more likely than not.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me approach it differently. The expected number of plumes when using the lysogenic phage on strain B is 1. The observed number is 40, which is 40 times higher. Assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of times the lysogenic phage can infect the lysogen, which requires recombination.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the probability of recombining at least once is approximately R (for small R). The number of plumes would then be proportional to R. Therefore, if the observed is 40 times the expected, then R must be 40, but that's not practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is related to the square of the recombination frequency. Because recombination can create two separate phages, leading to more plumes.\n\nSo, if the recombination frequency is R, then the number of plumes would be proportional to R^2. Therefore, if R^2 = 40, then R = sqrt(40) \u2248 6.32%. But none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is directly proportional to R, so R = 40. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the number of plumes is directly proportional to the number of double-strand breaks, which is proportional to the recombination frequency. So, if the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more often than not, then the recombination frequency is 40%, which is still not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as follows: the expected number of plumes without recombination is 1. With recombination, it's 2 (one as phage, one as lysogen). So, the observed is 40, which is 40 times higher than expected. So, the recombination frequency would be (40) / (1 + 40) )\u2248 97.56%, which isn't an option.\n\nThis suggests I'm approaching the problem incorrectly. Let me think again. The key is to relate the number of plumes to the likelihood of recombination. If the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it can infect the lysogen again, leading to more plumes. The number of plumes is determined by the number of double-strand breaks created during the infection process.\n\nEach recombination site contributes to creating a double-strand break, which upon lysis, allows the phage to integrate. Therefore, the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombination events. So, if the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more often than not, the number of plumes would be 40 times higher than expected.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency R is such that the expected number of plumes is 1, and the observed is 40. So, R = 40. But since the options don't include 40%, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So, if the observed is 40, and expected is 1, then R^2 = 40 \u2192 R \u2248 ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have more plumes on one lawn, it means more infections there.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes without any recombination. If both mutation types are present, theoretically, some combination should occur. But in this case, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. That implies that the lysogenic phage isn't interacting with the lysogenic wild type, perhaps? Or maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective against the lysogenic wild type. Alternatively, maybe the two phages recombine, allowing them to work together, meaning the lysogenic phage can now infect the lysogenic wild type. If that's the case, then when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it should be able to cause lytic fission, leading to more infections than just the lysogenic phage alone.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, the lysogenic phage didn't affect strain B, while the other type did. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the lysogenic wild type. Maybe the two phages are not compatible, and their recombination allows the lysogenic phage to infect the lysogenic phage, causing lytic fission. If that's true, then when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it would cause more infections, explaining why there were more plumes on K (strain B) compared to B (strain K).\n\nNow, let's consider the dilutions. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, and the second half 1:10^5. Dilution rate is important here. A higher dilution rate (like 1:10^5) means fewer potential sites for infection. However, in this case, since the lysogenic phage caused more infections on strain B (which wasn't affected), it suggests that the lysogenic phage could effectively target the lysogenic phage itself. That would happen if the two phages are compatible, meaning their genes can recombine, allowing the lysogenic phage to integrate into the lysogenic phage's genome.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this case, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes (infections) increased from what would have been expected without recombination. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would only infect the lysogenic wild type once. But with recombination, it can infect twice\u2014once as a lysogen and once as a phage within the lysogen. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain B would increase.\n\nLooking at the data: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, only 1 phage (lysogenic) would infect B, resulting in 1 plume. But with recombination, it infects twice, so 2 plumes per occurrence. Therefore, the observed number is much higher than expected. To find the recombination frequency, we can compare the ratio of observed to expected.\n\nExpected: 1 plume on B.\nObserved: 40 plumes on B.\n\nSo the ratio is 40/1 = 40 times higher than expected. This suggests a high level of recombination.\n\nHowever, the options given don't go up to 99%. Instead, the highest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach is to look at the probability of recombination. If R is the recombination frequency, then the probability that a phage will infect another phage is 2R/(1+R) when considering independent assortment.

So the recombination must be very high.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Observed - Expected)/(Observed + Expected)\n\nBut I might be mixing things up. Another way is to calculate how many times more often the lysogenic phage can infect the lysogenic phage.\n\nEach time the lysogenic phage infects the lysogenic phage, it can do so either as a phage (lytic) or integrate into the lysogen (lytic fission). So the total number of plumes would be proportional to the number of times this integration occurs plus the number of times it infects independently.\n\nAssuming independence, the expected number of plumes would be 1 (as phage) plus 1 (as lysogen) = 2. However, when recombination happens, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the lysogen, so it can infect the lysogen again. So the number increases.\n\nGiven that the observed is 40 vs expected 1, the ratio is 40. So the recombination frequency must be such that the probability of recombination multiplied by the independent chances leads to this outcome.\n\nAlternatively, the observed number is much higher, suggesting a high degree of recombination.

Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it would lyse all the cells, including those where the lysogenic phage is present. Therefore, every cell that contains the lysogenic phage would be lysed by the lysogenic phage, leading to a single plume per cell. So the number of plumes would equal the number of cells containing the lysogenic phage.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, it wouldn't lyse, so the lysogenic phage would replicate but not lyse. Therefore, the number of plumes would correspond to the number of cells that are free of the lysogenic phage. But since the lysogenic phage is being plated on strain K's lawn, which is resistant to its own replication, the number of plumes would reflect the number of cells without the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it causes lytic fission, leading to more plumes, while when used on strain K, it doesn't, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes is higher than when used on strain K. That suggests that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can infect both the lysogenic phage and the lysogenic phage-containing cells, leading to more plumes. Conversely, when used on strain K, it can only infect the lysogenic phage-free cells.\n\nBut in reality, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can infect all cells, including those with lysogenic phage, leading to more plumes. When used on strain K, it cannot infect the lysogenic phage, so only the lysogenic phage-free cells are affected, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, the number of plumes is 40, and on strain K, it's 4. Wait, that's counterintuitive because using the lysogenic phage on strain B should lead to more plumes than on strain K, which is resistant to the lysogenic phage.\n\nUnless the lysogenic phage can integrate into the lysogen, allowing it to infect the lysogen again, thereby causing more plumes. That would mean that when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, it can both infect the lysogen and the lysogen-containing cells, leading to more plumes. Whereas when used on strain K, it can't infect the lysogen, so only the lysogen-free cells are affected, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, if the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it can infect the lysogen again, leading to more plumes. Therefore, the presence of recombination in the lysogenic phage would explain the higher number of plumes on strain B.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The observed number of plumes on strain B is 40, and the expected number is 1 (assuming no recombination). So the ratio is 40, indicating that the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more likely than not.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me approach it differently. The expected number of plumes when using the lysogenic phage on strain B is 1. The observed number is 40, which is 40 times higher. Assuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of times the lysogenic phage can infect the lysogen, which requires recombination.\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency, then the probability of recombining at least once is approximately R (for small R). The number of plumes would then be proportional to R. Therefore, if the observed is 40 times the expected, then R must be 40, but that's not practical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is related to the square of the recombination frequency. Because recombination can create two separate phages, leading to more plumes.\n\nSo, if the recombination frequency is R, then the number of plumes would be proportional to R^2. Therefore, if R^2 = 40, then R = sqrt(40) \u2248 6.32%. But none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is directly proportional to R, so R = 40. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to recognize that the number of plumes is directly proportional to the number of double-strand breaks, which is proportional to the recombination frequency. So, if the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more often than not, then the recombination frequency is 40%, which is still not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as follows: the expected number of plumes without recombination is 1. With recombination, it's 2 (one as phage, one as lysogen). So, the observed is 40, which is 40 times higher than expected. So, the recombination frequency would be (40) / (1 + 40) )\u2248 97.56%, which isn't an option.\n\nThis suggests I'm approaching the problem incorrectly. Let me think again. The key is to relate the number of plumes to the likelihood of recombination. If the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it can infect the lysogen again, leading to more plumes. The number of plumes is determined by the number of double-strand breaks created during the infection process.\n\nEach recombination site contributes to creating a double-strand break, which upon lysis, allows the phage to integrate. Therefore, the number of plumes is proportional to the number of recombination events. So, if the lysogenic phage can recombine 40 times more often than not, the number of plumes would be 40 times higher than expected.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency R is such that the expected number of plumes is 1, and the observed is 40. So, R = 40. But since the options don't include 40%, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So, if the observed is 40, and expected is 1, then R^2 = 40 \u2192 R \u2248 ",

    "rollout": " So if a phage infects a bacterium, it creates a plume. \n\nNow, the key here is that the cells are being plated on different bacterial strains, which affects whether the phages cause lysis or not. Since strain B has one mutation that makes it susceptible and another that isn't, the presence of both might lead to a double mutant phenotype. But why did the division happen as such? Maybe the initial mix caused some recombinant phages to form, where one mutation comes from one phage and another from another. \n\nThe experiment shows that when the E. coli strain B was plated with the mixed phages, half had been successfully lysed, while the other half didn't. Then those that were lysed (the ones without the lysogenic phage) were further tested on the K strain. So the first set of plates (on B) showed some infections leading to lyosis, indicating the presence of a lysogenic phage. But then those same bacteria were plated on K, which probably lacks the lysogenic phage. However, the results show more plumes on K than on B, suggesting that some of the initially lysed phages survived and became independent phages, leading to their own colonies when plated on K. This would indicate that the lysogenic phage could survive and become dominant, allowing for additional infections. \n\nThis survival suggests that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation (recombination) that allows it to resist being detected by the B strain. If the recombination is incomplete, the lysogenic phage would be detectable by B, leading to lyosis, whereas a fully recombinant phage wouldn't be detected, thus surviving and causing no lyosis. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we can use the ratio of successful lyosings and surviving phages. In the first set, half the bacteria were lyosed (40), and the other half (plated on K) resulted in more plumes (40 vs. 4). That implies that 80% of the phages were lysogenic, meaning 20% were recombinant. \n\nBut wait, the numbers given are 40 on K and 4 on B. Wait, no, actually, when the E. coli strain B is plated with the mixed phages, 40% of the phages cause lyosis, and the remaining 60% don't. These unlysed phages are then plated on strain K. Because K lacks the lysogenic phage, these phages are susceptible. However, the fact that there are more plumes on K than on B suggests that some of the unlysed phages survived and became lyposable, i.e., they carried the lysogenic mutation. \n\nSo if 80% of the phages were lysogenic (leading to lyosis on B), then 20% were not. The 20% that weren't should have carried the recombination because they didn't lyose on B. When plated on K, these phages would lyse, resulting in more plumes on K. \n\nIn the experiment, 40 plumes were on B (lysed), and 40 on K (from the survivors). Wait, but the user said 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of plumes per plate. Each plume represents a new phage infection event. So if 40 plumes were on B, that means 40 phages caused lyosis. Similarly, 4 plumes on K mean 4 phages caused lyosis there. \n\nWait, but the total number of phages used should be the same. Let's assume each plate has N phages. For the first set, half are ly sed and half are not. Let\u2019s say N = 2 * 40 = 80 phages. So 40 ly sed (so 40 phages causing lyosis), and 40 not ly sed. Plating these 40 not ly sed on K gives more plumes, which equals the 4 observed. \n\nIf all not ly sed were completely resistant (i.e., fully recombined), then the number of plumes on K would equal the number of not ly sed on B, which is 40. But in reality, only 4 plumes appeared on K. That suggests that fewer than 40 phages were resistant. \n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the number of resistant phages (those that were not recombined). We know that R + L = N, where L is the number of ly sed. From the data, R = 4, L = 40. Wait, that doesn\u2019t add up because R must be less than N. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, suppose that when the phages were plated on K, only 4 were ly sed. If the original not ly sed (40) were 80% resistant, then 80% of 40 is 32, which isn't matching. Maybe it's better to think in terms of expected values. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of phages that are resistant is (1 - r). Let\u2019s assume that during the mixing phase, the probability that a phage carries the lysogenic mutation is p. Then, the expected number of resistant phages among the not ly sed would be p * (N/2). \n\nFrom the first experiment, 40 phages caused lyosis, and 40 didn\u2019t. If the resistance rate is r, then (1 - r) * (number of not ly sed) = number of resistant phages. Let's say the original not ly sed were x. Then resistant phages = (1 - r) * x. \n\nWhen these resistant phages are plated on K, they lyse, contributing to the plumes on K. Suppose the total number of plumes on K is y. Then y = resistant phages * efficiency. But efficiency here is likely 100%, so y = resistant phages. \n\nFrom the data, on K, y = 4, and on B, y = 40. Therefore, resistant phages = 4. And x = 40 (since half were ly sed). So 4 = (1 - r) * 40 \u2192 (1 - r) = 4 / 40 = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. \n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the options don\u2019t include 0.9%. Did I make a mistake? Let me check. If the not ly sed are 40, and resistant phages are 4, then 4 = (1 - r) * 40 \u2192 (1 - r) = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. So 90% recombination. But none of the options are close to that. \n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Perhaps the initial mixing leads to some proportion of recombination, and the subsequent testing reveals how much survived. Alternatively, let's consider the frequency of resistant phages. \n\nAnother approach: The number of resistant phages is proportional to the square root of the number of plumes. Or maybe using the Poisson approximation. Alternatively, considering that the number of resistant phages is equal to the number of plumes on K multiplied by the efficiency. \n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The number of resistant phages is equal to the number of plumes on K. So 4 resistant phages came from the not ly sed. Since the not ly sed were 40, the recombination rate is 4 / 40 = 0.1, so 10%. But that's option F. However, the options don't go beyond 0.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it differently. Let's denote r as the recombination rate. The number of resistant phages is (1 - r) * (number of not ly sed). So 4 = (1 - r) * 40 \u2192 (1 - r) = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. But again, that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of resistant phages is sqrt(40 * 4) = sqrt(160) \u2248 12.6, but that seems off. Alternatively, using the formula for the number of plumes due to recombination, which might involve the product of the probabilities. \n\nWait, I think I recall that when two mutations occur independently, the expected number of plumes due to recombination is n1 * n2 * r, where r is the recombination frequency. Here, n1 is the number of ly sed phages, and n2 is the number of resistant phages. \n\nGiven that n1 = 40 and n2 = 4, and assuming that the expected number of plumes due to recombination is 40 * 4 * r, and knowing that the total plumes on K are 4, which includes both the original ly sed and the new ones from recombination. Wait, no, because when you plate the resistant phages on K, they will lyse, producing plumes. So the total plumes on K would be the sum of the ly sed from B and the resistant from K. But in this case, the ly sed from B are already accounted for separately. Wait, no, actually, the ly sed from B are 40, and the resistant phages from K are 4, making a total of 44. But the actual count is 4 on K. So that suggests that the majority of the plumes come from the ly sed, except for the 4 that arose from the recombination. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try another angle. The number of resistant phages is 4, and the number of not ly sed is 40. Assuming that the recombination occurs at a rate r, the expected number of resistant phages is (1 - r) * 40. So:\n\n(1 - r) * 40 = 4  \n\u2192 1 - r = 0.1  \n\u2192 r = 0.9\n\nBut that's 90% recombination, which isn't an option. The closest higher option is G (0.5%), but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. \n\nWait, maybe the number of resistant phages is 4, and the number of not ly sed is 40, so the recombination rate is 4 / 40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But 10% isn't an option either. The closest lower is J (0.05%) and I (0.02%). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes due to recombination is proportional to the product of the fractions. Let\u2019s denote the fraction of the phages that are resistant as r. Then the number of plumes due to recombination would be 40 * 4 * r. But the total plumes on K are 4, which may include both the ly sed and the new ones. However, since the ly sed from B are already counted separately, the 4 on K could be due to recombination. Thus, 4 = 40 * 4 * r \u2192 r = 4 / (40 * 4) = 1/40 = 0.025 \u2192 0.025%, which rounds to 0.02%, option I. \n\nThat makes sense because if r is 0.025, about 0.025%, then the plumes on K would account for the recombination. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be I. 0.02 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Maybe it's better to think in terms of expected values. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of phages that are resistant is (1 - r). Let\u2019s assume that during the mixing phase, the probability that a phage carries the lysogenic mutation is p.

Recombination allows for increased efficiency in lysogeny, meaning the phage can integrate its genetic material into the host genome better. This reduces resistance to lytic phages because the phage has a higher chance of integrating. If there's no recombination, the phages might replicate independently without integrating. In experiments like this, when you have different phage types, the presence of one type can affect whether another integrates successfully.\n\nThe key here is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant phages depends on the frequency of the original phage types and their ability to integrate. However, in this case, since we're dealing with a population of phages, the observed distribution can help us estimate the rate of recombination.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed together, the number of phages that successfully integrate into the host genome will depend on whether they share the same or different genetic loci. Phages with identical loci (no recombination) would replicate independently, while those with different loci would integrate more efficiently. \n\nIn the experiment, the half that was placed on strain B (with the lysogenic phage) had fewer plumes (40) compared to the half on strain K (4). That seems counterintuitive because I'd expect the lysogenic phage to be more effective at causing lysogeny. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the non-recombinant phage (lytic) caused some interference, reducing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage should be more efficient at causing lysogeny because it integrates better. So if the lysogenic phage didn't cause as many issues, maybe there's some error in the experiment or a misunderstanding. Or perhaps the numbers are off because the dilution factors are significant. \n\nLooking back, the lysogenic phage was placed on strain B's lawn with a dilution of 1:10^7, meaning each test tube has 1 phage per 10 million cells. The other half on strain K with a lower dilution of 1:10^5. Since both strains are E. coli, their genomes are similar enough for testing. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrated well, the plumes would be more frequent, but in this case, the lysogenic plumes are less frequent than the other strain. Maybe the integration wasn't as efficient, leading to fewer successful infections. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, I think the formula is r = (1 - p)(1 - q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two mutation types. Alternatively, the proportion of recombinant phages can be calculated from the number of plumes. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So the presence of the non-integrating lysogenic phage reduced the number of successful integrations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers indicate the actual recombination rate. For instance, if the expected number of recombinant phages is known, we can compare it to the observed. \n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. Suppose there are two types of phages: one that integrates (recombinant) and one that doesn't (non-recombinant). The non-recombinant phage (lytic) was placed on strain B's lawn, which is the strain being tested for lysogeny. If the phage doesn't integrate, it shouldn't cause any lysis, hence fewer plumes. \n\nBut the lysogenic phage was placed on strain B, and despite having a higher frequency due to the high dilution, it didn't cause as many issues as the other half. That could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate effectively, indicating low recombination. \n\nIf the recombination rate is low, then the expected number of plumes would be close to the number of non-recombinant phages. So if 40 plumes are seen on B and 4 on K, maybe the recombination rate is such that 96% of the phages integrated (since 4/100 is 4%, recombination would leave 96%). Wait, but 4/100 is 4%, which isn't a standard percentage. Maybe it's expressed differently.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.05 percent, then 0.05% of the phages integrated, leaving 99.95% un-integrated. Then, the number of plumes would reflect that. But I'm not sure how to directly relate the percentages to the observed counts.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. If the recombination rate is r, then the expected number of successful lysogeny events (plumes) on strain B would be proportional to (1 - r), assuming that the lysogenic phage integrates with probability (1 - r). Similarly, on strain K, the non-lysogenic phage (lytic) doesn't integrate, so all the phages would fail, resulting in more plumes.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let\u2019s assume that:\n\n- The frequency of the non-integrating lysogenic phage is p = 1/10^7 (due to dilution).\n- The frequency of the integrating lysogenic phage is q = 6/10^7.\n- The non-integrating non-phage (lytic) phage is r = 1/10^7.\n\nThe expected number of plumes on strain B (which is lysogenic) would be influenced by the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it becomes a lysogenic phage; otherwise, it remains non-integrating.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected phage from the lysogenic strain is integrated is (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Therefore, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be related to (1 - r).\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes, so the number of plumes would correspond to the frequency of the non-integrating phage multiplied by the total plasmid density.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to simplify. The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it becomes a functional phage that infects the cells. If it doesn't integrate, it doesn't cause lysogeny.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the other half affects strain K, the difference in plume count can help estimate the recombination rate. \n\nFrom the experiment, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Assuming that the non-integrating phage (lytic) causes more plumes, the difference suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently. \n\nIf the recombination rate is very low, say 0.05%, then the lysogenic phage wouldn't integrate much, so most of them would remain non-integrating. On strain B, only the non-integrating phages would cause lysogeny, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, on strain K, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes, resulting in more plumes.\n\nGiven that on K, there are 40 plumes, and on B, 4, the ratio is 10 times higher. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated about 10 times less frequently. \n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination rate (r) \u2248 (number of successful plumes on B / total plumes) * 100%\n\nBut wait, the exact relationship might require more precise calculation. Alternatively, considering that the expected number of lysogenic phages would be (1 - r) times the total number, and the observed plumes correspond to this.\n\nAssuming that the total number of plumes on B is proportional to the number of non-integrating phages, and similarly for K.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the recombination rate affects the number of successful lysogeny events. Given that the lysogenic phage did not cause as many plumes as the non-integrating one, we can infer that recombination occurred less frequently.\n\nTo get the exact percentage, perhaps we can set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote the recombination rate as r. The number of phages that integrate is (1 - r) * N, where N is the total number of phages. However, in this case, the phages are already present in a certain concentration due to the dilutions. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. So, if the recombination rate is r, then on strain B, the number of successful lysogeny events would be proportional to (1 - r). On strain K, since the non-integrating phage (lytic) causes all the plumes, the number of plumes on K would be higher.\n\nGiven that on B, it's 4 plumes, and on K, it's 40, the ratio is 10 times higher. So, if the lysogenic phage integrated r% of the time, then (1 - r) would be the fraction that leads to lysogeny. \n\nBut since the lysogenic phage didn't integrate as much, (1 - r) would be lower. Let's suppose that on B, the fraction of successful lysogeny is x, and on K, it's y. We have y = 10x, because K has 10 times more plumes. \n\nBut why 10 times? Because the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently, so (1 - r) is lower. \n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is determined by the dilution factor. The lysogenic phage was placed on a dilution of 1:10^7, whereas the non-integrating phage (lytic) was placed on 1:10^5. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage is more abundant (higher dilution), even though it's less likely to integrate, it's possible that the number of plumes increases relative to the non-integrating phage. \n\nWait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the number of phages on each plate. Each half is 5ml, and they're plated on either strain B or K. The lysogenic phage is placed on a higher dilution, so it's present in fewer copies, but each copy has a higher chance of integrating. \n\nBut the presence of the non-integrating phage (lytic) on strain B reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, leading to fewer plumes. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage resulted in 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10 times. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated at a rate that allowed 10 times fewer plumes. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of phages that integrate is (1 - r). Therefore, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to (1 - r) * N, where N is the total number of phages. On K, since the non-integrating phage causes all plumes, the number of plumes would be equal to the total number of non-integrating phages. \n\nWait, I'm still not clear. Perhaps I should use the formula for the expected number of plumes. The expected number of plumes (E) can be modeled as:\n\nE = (N integrate) + (N non-integrate)\n\nWhere N integrate is the number of phages that successfully integrated, and N non-integrate are the phages that didn't integrate. \n\nBut in reality, N integrate = (1 - r) * N_total, and N non-integrate = r * N_total. \n\nOn strain B, the phages are lysogenic, so the plumes come from phages that either integrate (and become lysogenic) or remain non-integrating. \n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let's take a step back. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage (on strain B) caused 40 plumes, while the non-integrating phage (lytic) caused 4 plumes. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently, so (1 - r) is lower. \n\nAssuming that the total number of phages on each plate is the same, the ratio of plumes would be approximately equal to the ratio of (1 - r). \n\nSo, 40 plumes on B vs. 4 on K implies that the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently. Therefore, 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 0.9. Wait, but that's 90% recombination, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 10 times, so (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 90%. Again, none of the options are near 90%. Maybe I misunderstood the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the ratio of plumes on K to B is 10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently. Thus, (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 90%. Still not matching the options. \n\nWait, looking at the answer choices, the highest is 0.5 percent. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. So, the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently, making r = 9/10 = 90%. But this isn't among the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the ratio of plumes. So, if the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less, then r = 1/10 = 0.1, which is 10%. Looking at the options, option D is 0.05%, and E is 0.02%. None is 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of plumes reflects the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrated, it became a lysogenic phage, and thus would lead to fewer plumes. Conversely, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the recombination rate is r. Then, the fraction of phages that integrate is (1 - r). The number of plumes on strain B (where the phage is lysogenic) would be proportional to (1 - r). On strain K (where the phage is non-integrating), the number of plumes would be proportional to the total number of non-integrating phages, which is r * N_total.\n\nGiven that on B, the number of plumes is 4, and on K, it's 40, the ratio is 40:4=10:1. So, (r * N_total)/(1 - r) = 10. Solving for r:\n\n(r * N_total) = 10*(1 - r)\nr*N_total = 10 - 10*r\nr*(N_total +10)=10\nr=10/(N_total+10)\n\nBut I don\u2019t know N_total. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to (1 - r), and on strain K, it would be proportional to r. But since strain K has 10 times more plumes, (1 - r)/r = 10.\n\nSolving for r:\n\n(1 - r)/r =10\n1 - r =10r\n1=11r\nr=1/11\u22480.0909\u2192~9.09%\n\nStill not matching the answer choices. The closest is E:0.02%, which is about 2%, but 9.09% is closer to 10%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times more frequently, then (1 - r) =10*r \u21921=r*11\u2192r=1/11\u22489.09%. No, that doesn't make sense because (1 - r) would be larger than r.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes relates to the square root of the recombination rate. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the phage abundance. But without knowing the exact concentrations, it's hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, since the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes and the non-integrating phage caused 4, the ratio is 10:1. Therefore, the recombination rate must be such that the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the recombination rate is 0.05%, then (1 - 0.05%)=0.9995, which is almost 1. So, the lysogenic phage would integrate nearly all the time, leading to minimal plumes, which contradicts the data.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which makes sense. Let's check each option against the ratio of plumes (40:4=10:1).\n\nOption A: 1% recombination. Then, (1 - 0.01)=0.99. So, lysogenic phages integrate 99% of the time, leading to 1% success. On strain B, this would give 1% of plumes, but in our case, it's 40, which is much higher. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption B: 2% recombination. Then, (1 -0.02)=0.98. On B, 0.98 plumes, but we have 40, which is much higher. Not possible.\n\nOption C: 1.5%. (1 -0.015)=0.985. Same issue as above.\n\nOption D: 0.05%. (1 -0.0005)=0.9995. Still too high.\n\nOption E: 0.02%. (1 -0.0002)=0.9998. Also too high.\n\nHmm, none of the options",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are more plumes on K than on B, maybe the recombination affects how often the phages infect the cells. \n\nLet me recall what I know about recombinant phages. Recombination allows for increased efficiency in lysogeny, meaning the phage can integrate its genetic material into the host genome better. This reduces resistance to lytic phages because the phage has a higher chance of integrating. If there's no recombination, the phages might replicate independently without integrating. In experiments like this, when you have different phage types, the presence of one type can affect whether another integrates successfully.\n\nThe key here is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The formula for calculating the expected number of recombinant phages depends on the frequency of the original phage types and their ability to integrate. However, in this case, since we're dealing with a population of phages, the observed distribution can help us estimate the rate of recombination.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed together, the number of phages that successfully integrate into the host genome will depend on whether they share the same or different genetic loci. Phages with identical loci (no recombination) would replicate independently, while those with different loci would integrate more efficiently. \n\nIn the experiment, the half that was placed on strain B (with the lysogenic phage) had fewer plumes (40) compared to the half on strain K (4). That seems counterintuitive because I'd expect the lysogenic phage to be more effective at causing lysogeny. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the non-recombinant phage (lytic) caused some interference, reducing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, let me think again. The lysogenic phage should be more efficient at causing lysogeny because it integrates better. So if the lysogenic phage didn't cause as many issues, maybe there's some error in the experiment or a misunderstanding. Or perhaps the numbers are off because the dilution factors are significant. \n\nLooking back, the lysogenic phage was placed on strain B's lawn with a dilution of 1:10^7, meaning each test tube has 1 phage per 10 million cells. The other half on strain K with a lower dilution of 1:10^5. Since both strains are E. coli, their genomes are similar enough for testing. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrated well, the plumes would be more frequent, but in this case, the lysogenic plumes are less frequent than the other strain. Maybe the integration wasn't as efficient, leading to fewer successful infections. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, I think the formula is r = (1 - p)(1 - q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two mutation types. Alternatively, the proportion of recombinant phages can be calculated from the number of plumes. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So the presence of the non-integrating lysogenic phage reduced the number of successful integrations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers indicate the actual recombination rate. For instance, if the expected number of recombinant phages is known, we can compare it to the observed. \n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. Suppose there are two types of phages: one that integrates (recombinant) and one that doesn't (non-recombinant). The non-recombinant phage (lytic) was placed on strain B's lawn, which is the strain being tested for lysogeny. If the phage doesn't integrate, it shouldn't cause any lysis, hence fewer plumes. \n\nBut the lysogenic phage was placed on strain B, and despite having a higher frequency due to the high dilution, it didn't cause as many issues as the other half. That could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate effectively, indicating low recombination. \n\nIf the recombination rate is low, then the expected number of plumes would be close to the number of non-recombinant phages. So if 40 plumes are seen on B and 4 on K, maybe the recombination rate is such that 96% of the phages integrated (since 4/100 is 4%, recombination would leave 96%). Wait, but 4/100 is 4%, which isn't a standard percentage. Maybe it's expressed differently.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.05 percent, then 0.05% of the phages integrated, leaving 99.95% un-integrated. Then, the number of plumes would reflect that. But I'm not sure how to directly relate the percentages to the observed counts.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. If the recombination rate is r, then the expected number of successful lysogeny events (plumes) on strain B would be proportional to (1 - r), assuming that the lysogenic phage integrates with probability (1 - r). Similarly, on strain K, the non-lysogenic phage (lytic) doesn't integrate, so all the phages would fail, resulting in more plumes.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let\u2019s assume that:\n\n- The frequency of the non-integrating lysogenic phage is p = 1/10^7 (due to dilution).\n- The frequency of the integrating lysogenic phage is q = 6/10^7.\n- The non-integrating non-phage (lytic) phage is r = 1/10^7.\n\nThe expected number of plumes on strain B (which is lysogenic) would be influenced by the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it becomes a lysogenic phage; otherwise, it remains non-integrating.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected phage from the lysogenic strain is integrated is (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. Therefore, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be related to (1 - r).\n\nSimilarly, on strain K, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes, so the number of plumes would correspond to the frequency of the non-integrating phage multiplied by the total plasmid density.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to simplify. The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. If the lysogenic phage integrates, it becomes a functional phage that infects the cells. If it doesn't integrate, it doesn't cause lysogeny.\n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the other half affects strain K, the difference in plume count can help estimate the recombination rate. \n\nFrom the experiment, 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Assuming that the non-integrating phage (lytic) causes more plumes, the difference suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently. \n\nIf the recombination rate is very low, say 0.05%, then the lysogenic phage wouldn't integrate much, so most of them would remain non-integrating. On strain B, only the non-integrating phages would cause lysogeny, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, on strain K, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes, resulting in more plumes.\n\nGiven that on K, there are 40 plumes, and on B, 4, the ratio is 10 times higher. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated about 10 times less frequently. \n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination rate (r) \u2248 (number of successful plumes on B / total plumes) * 100%\n\nBut wait, the exact relationship might require more precise calculation. Alternatively, considering that the expected number of lysogenic phages would be (1 - r) times the total number, and the observed plumes correspond to this.\n\nAssuming that the total number of plumes on B is proportional to the number of non-integrating phages, and similarly for K.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the recombination rate affects the number of successful lysogeny events. Given that the lysogenic phage did not cause as many plumes as the non-integrating one, we can infer that recombination occurred less frequently.\n\nTo get the exact percentage, perhaps we can set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote the recombination rate as r. The number of phages that integrate is (1 - r) * N, where N is the total number of phages. However, in this case, the phages are already present in a certain concentration due to the dilutions. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. So, if the recombination rate is r, then on strain B, the number of successful lysogeny events would be proportional to (1 - r). On strain K, since the non-integrating phage (lytic) causes all the plumes, the number of plumes on K would be higher.\n\nGiven that on B, it's 4 plumes, and on K, it's 40, the ratio is 10 times higher. So, if the lysogenic phage integrated r% of the time, then (1 - r) would be the fraction that leads to lysogeny. \n\nBut since the lysogenic phage didn't integrate as much, (1 - r) would be lower. Let's suppose that on B, the fraction of successful lysogeny is x, and on K, it's y. We have y = 10x, because K has 10 times more plumes. \n\nBut why 10 times? Because the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently, so (1 - r) is lower. \n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is determined by the dilution factor. The lysogenic phage was placed on a dilution of 1:10^7, whereas the non-integrating phage (lytic) was placed on 1:10^5. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage is more abundant (higher dilution), even though it's less likely to integrate, it's possible that the number of plumes increases relative to the non-integrating phage. \n\nWait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the number of phages on each plate. Each half is 5ml, and they're plated on either strain B or K. The lysogenic phage is placed on a higher dilution, so it's present in fewer copies, but each copy has a higher chance of integrating. \n\nBut the presence of the non-integrating phage (lytic) on strain B reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, leading to fewer plumes. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage resulted in 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10 times. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated at a rate that allowed 10 times fewer plumes. \n\nIf the recombination rate is r, then the fraction of phages that integrate is (1 - r). Therefore, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to (1 - r) * N, where N is the total number of phages. On K, since the non-integrating phage causes all plumes, the number of plumes would be equal to the total number of non-integrating phages. \n\nWait, I'm still not clear. Perhaps I should use the formula for the expected number of plumes. The expected number of plumes (E) can be modeled as:\n\nE = (N integrate) + (N non-integrate)\n\nWhere N integrate is the number of phages that successfully integrated, and N non-integrate are the phages that didn't integrate. \n\nBut in reality, N integrate = (1 - r) * N_total, and N non-integrate = r * N_total. \n\nOn strain B, the phages are lysogenic, so the plumes come from phages that either integrate (and become lysogenic) or remain non-integrating. \n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let's take a step back. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage (on strain B) caused 40 plumes, while the non-integrating phage (lytic) caused 4 plumes. This implies that the lysogenic phage integrated less frequently, so (1 - r) is lower. \n\nAssuming that the total number of phages on each plate is the same, the ratio of plumes would be approximately equal to the ratio of (1 - r). \n\nSo, 40 plumes on B vs. 4 on K implies that the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently. Therefore, 1 - r = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 0.9. Wait, but that's 90% recombination, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 10 times, so (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 90%. Again, none of the options are near 90%. Maybe I misunderstood the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the ratio of plumes on K to B is 10:1, meaning that the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently. Thus, (1 - r) = 1/10 \u2192 r = 9/10 = 90%. Still not matching the options. \n\nWait, looking at the answer choices, the highest is 0.5 percent. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. So, the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less frequently, making r = 9/10 = 90%. But this isn't among the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the ratio of plumes. So, if the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times less, then r = 1/10 = 0.1, which is 10%. Looking at the options, option D is 0.05%, and E is 0.02%. None is 10%.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of plumes reflects the recombination rate. If the lysogenic phage integrated, it became a lysogenic phage, and thus would lead to fewer plumes. Conversely, the non-integrating phage (lytic) would cause all the plumes.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the recombination rate is r. Then, the fraction of phages that integrate is (1 - r). The number of plumes on strain B (where the phage is lysogenic) would be proportional to (1 - r). On strain K (where the phage is non-integrating), the number of plumes would be proportional to the total number of non-integrating phages, which is r * N_total.\n\nGiven that on B, the number of plumes is 4, and on K, it's 40, the ratio is 40:4=10:1. So, (r * N_total)/(1 - r) = 10. Solving for r:\n\n(r * N_total) = 10*(1 - r)\nr*N_total = 10 - 10*r\nr*(N_total +10)=10\nr=10/(N_total+10)\n\nBut I don\u2019t know N_total. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to (1 - r), and on strain K, it would be proportional to r. But since strain K has 10 times more plumes, (1 - r)/r = 10.\n\nSolving for r:\n\n(1 - r)/r =10\n1 - r =10r\n1=11r\nr=1/11\u22480.0909\u2192~9.09%\n\nStill not matching the answer choices. The closest is E:0.02%, which is about 2%, but 9.09% is closer to 10%, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If the lysogenic phage integrated 10 times more frequently, then (1 - r) =10*r \u21921=r*11\u2192r=1/11\u22489.09%. No, that doesn't make sense because (1 - r) would be larger than r.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plumes relates to the square root of the recombination rate. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the recombination rate and the phage abundance. But without knowing the exact concentrations, it's hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, since the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes and the non-integrating phage caused 4, the ratio is 10:1. Therefore, the recombination rate must be such that the number of plumes is reduced by a factor of 10. \n\nIf the recombination rate is 0.05%, then (1 - 0.05%)=0.9995, which is almost 1. So, the lysogenic phage would integrate nearly all the time, leading to minimal plumes, which contradicts the data.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which makes sense. Let's check each option against the ratio of plumes (40:4=10:1).\n\nOption A: 1% recombination. Then, (1 - 0.01)=0.99. So, lysogenic phages integrate 99% of the time, leading to 1% success. On strain B, this would give 1% of plumes, but in our case, it's 40, which is much higher. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption B: 2% recombination. Then, (1 -0.02)=0.98. On B, 0.98 plumes, but we have 40, which is much higher. Not possible.\n\nOption C: 1.5%. (1 -0.015)=0.985. Same issue as above.\n\nOption D: 0.05%. (1 -0.0005)=0.9995. Still too high.\n\nOption E: 0.02%. (1 -0.0002)=0.9998. Also too high.\n\nHmm, none of the options",

    "rollout": " So, the number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully entered and integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nLet me recall what I know about recombination in phages. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different phage strains. In this case, we have a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyse the cell but integrates its DNA into the host genome. If another phage has a lysogenic mutation, it might cause cross-reactivity if it can integrate without disrupting the existing phage. However, if the second phage is lysogenic as well, their integration would be more likely to disrupt the first phage, causing it to lyse. \n\nIn the experiment, strain B is primarily affected when both mutant types are present. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into strain B's own chromosome, but perhaps when mixed with a lysogenic phage from strain K, their integration might disrupt the lysogenic phage in strain B. This could lead to reduced activity in the presence of both mutants. Alternatively, maybe some of the lysogenic phages from strain B are integrating into strain K's chromosome instead of their own, leading to interference with the lysogenic phage in strain B.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Since the experiment involved both mutant types being present, the recombination rate should indicate how often the lysogenic phages integrated into the other strain's genome rather than their own. Each successful recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage from strain B is integrating into strain K's chromosome, thereby potentially disrupting the lysogenic phage in strain B. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage from strain B was integrating into its own genome, it wouldn't cause disruption in strain B.\n\nThe dilution factors are important. The first half is plated at 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has a low chance of being selected against. The second half is plated at 1:10^5, which is higher, giving more selection pressure. The numbers of plumes observed depend on the likelihood of successful recombination during the plating process.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then all the plumes would come from strain B's original lysogenic phage, and none from strain K's. However, we see some plumes from both strains, indicating that some of the lysogenic phages did integrate into the other strain's genome.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals), multiplied by 100%. Here, the total number is the sum of plumes from both strains: 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant plumes (assuming they are from strain K) would be 4. So, (4/44)*100% \u2248 9.09%, which isn't one of the options provided. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The experiment shows that when both mutant types are present, strain B is partially affected. So, the lysogenic phage from strain B must sometimes integrate into strain K's chromosome, causing it to disrupt the lysogenic phage in strain B, thus reducing its activity. Therefore, the number of plumes from strain K should reflect the extent of such integrations.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency might be calculated differently. Maybe the ratio is based on the number of plumes per half. The first half had 4 plumes, and the second half had 40. The difference could indicate the number of recombinations. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability of recombination occurring during the plating. The probability p of recombination is related to the dilution factor. If the recombination happens once during the plating process, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the dilution.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of recombinants is N * p, where N is the total number of plasmids. In the first half, N = 4 * 10^7, and in the second half, N = 40 * 10^5. The probability p depends on the number of plasmids available and the chance of recombination.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps a simpler way is to use the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into strain K's chromosome, each such integration would reduce the number of plumes from strain B. Similarly, if it integrates into its own chromosome, it won't affect strain B.\n\nGiven that the first half (strain B alone) has fewer plumes than the second half (both strains), it suggests that some of the phages integrated into the other strain's chromosome. The exact number would determine the recombination rate.\n\nSince the answer choices are small percentages, it implies that the recombination is quite low. Looking at the options, 0.05% seems plausible, possibly option J or E. However, given the dilution factors and the numbers, it might be closer to 0.02% (option E) or 0.05%.\n\nI think I need to calculate it more precisely. Suppose R is the recombination rate. The number of plumes from strain K would be proportional to R times the total plumes. From the data, 4 plumes came from K, while 40 came from B. So, 4 = R * 44? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the proportion of plumes from K is R/(R+1). Or perhaps R is the fraction of plumes from K relative to B. Wait, let me think again.\n\nEach time a phage integrates into another's chromosome, it reduces the chance of the lysogenic phage in strain B being detected. So, if x is the recombination rate, then the number of plumes from strain K would be proportional to x times the total plumes. So, 4 = x * (4 + 40). That gives 4 = x*44 \u2192 x\u22480.091, which is approximately 1%, but that's not among the options. Hmm, maybe I'm still off.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful integrations. Since both types are present, some of the lysogenic phages must have integrated into the other strain's chromosome. The ratio of plumes would indicate the proportion of such integrations.\n\nSo, if 4 plumes came from K and 40 from B, the total is 44. The fraction from K is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is close to 10%, but the closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Maybe my calculation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination occurs once during the plating process, and the number of plumes reflects the number of successful integrations. If R is the recombination rate, then the expected number of plumes from K would be R*(N_B + N_K), where N_B and N_K are the plasmids from each strain. Given that N_B = 4 * 10^7 and N_K = 40 * 10^5, the total is 44 * 10^6. The number of plumes from K is 4, so R \u2248 4 / (44 * 10^6) \u2248 9.09e-8, which is less than 1%. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the number of plumes relates to the number of plasmids. If R is the recombination rate, then the number of plumes from K would be R * (N_B + N_K). Solving for R: R = 4 / (4 * 10^7 + 40 * 10^5) = 4 / (44 * 10^6) \u2248 9.09e-8%, which is negligible. Doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers only the relative efficiency of each strain. Strain B has a lower dilution factor (1:10^7) compared to strain K (1:10^5), meaning strain B's plating is more efficient. If strain B's plating resulted in 4 plumes and strain K's in 40, the ratio is 1:10, suggesting that recombination occurred in 10% of cases, but that's too high.\n\nWait, maybe I should reverse the ratios. If strain K has a higher dilution factor, the number of plumes from K is 4, and from B is 40. Then the ratio is 1:10, implying a 10% recombination rate. Still, that's not matching any options.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try another angle. The problem states that when both mutant types are present, strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into strain K's chromosome, disrupting its activity. Therefore, some of the lysogenic phages from strain B are now integrating into strain K's genome, which reduces their ability to lyse strain B.\n\nThe number of plumes detected from K is 4, and from B is 40. Assuming that the recombination rate affects the number of plumes from K, the ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. This means that recombination happened in 10% of the cases, but the options don't include 10%. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the dilution factors.\n\nStrain B's plating is at 1:10^7, so each plasmid has a very low chance of being selected. Strain K's plating is at 1:10^5, so higher chance. The number of plumes detected from K is four times that from B (4 vs. 40). So, if the recombination rate is proportional to the dilution factor, then:\n\nLet R be the recombination rate. For strain B: R = 4 / (4 * 10^7) = 1e-7. For strain K: R = 40 / (40 * 10^5) = 1e-7. So, same rate, but this doesn't explain why the numbers differ. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nSo, R = 4 / (4 * 10^7) = 1e-7 for strain B, and R = 40 / (40 * 10^5) = 1e-7 for strain K. Both give the same rate. That's odd; maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the ratio of plumes (4:40=1:10) indicates the recombination frequency.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So, the number of plumes indicates how many times the phage successfully entered and integrated into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nLet me recall what I know about recombination in phages. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different phage strains. In this case, we have a lysogenic phage that doesn't lyse the cell but integrates its DNA into the host genome. If another phage has a lysogenic mutation, it might cause cross-reactivity if it can integrate without disrupting the existing phage. However, if the second phage is lysogenic as well, their integration would be more likely to disrupt the first phage, causing it to lyse. \n\nIn the experiment, strain B is primarily affected when both mutant types are present. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into strain B's own chromosome, but perhaps when mixed with a lysogenic phage from strain K, their integration might disrupt the lysogenic phage in strain B. This could lead to reduced activity in the presence of both mutants. Alternatively, maybe some of the lysogenic phages from strain B are integrating into strain K's chromosome instead of their own, leading to interference with the lysogenic phage in strain B.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Since the experiment involved both mutant types being present, the recombination rate should indicate how often the lysogenic phages integrated into the other strain's genome rather than their own. Each successful recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage from strain B is integrating into strain K's chromosome, thereby potentially disrupting the lysogenic phage in strain B. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage from strain B was integrating into its own genome, it wouldn't cause disruption in strain B.\n\nThe dilution factors are important. The first half is plated at 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has a low chance of being selected against. The second half is plated at 1:10^5, which is higher, giving more selection pressure. The numbers of plumes observed depend on the likelihood of successful recombination during the plating process.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then all the plumes would come from strain B's original lysogenic phage, and none from strain K's. However, we see some plumes from both strains, indicating that some of the lysogenic phages did integrate into the other strain's genome.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals), multiplied by 100%. Here, the total number is the sum of plumes from both strains: 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinant plumes (assuming they are from strain K) would be 4. So, (4/44)*100% \u2248 9.09%, which isn't one of the options provided. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The experiment shows that when both mutant types are present, strain B is partially affected. So, the lysogenic phage from strain B must sometimes integrate into strain K's chromosome, causing it to disrupt the lysogenic phage in strain B, thus reducing its activity. Therefore, the number of plumes from strain K should reflect the extent of such integrations.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency might be calculated differently. Maybe the ratio is based on the number of plumes per half. The first half had 4 plumes, and the second half had 40. The difference could indicate the number of recombinations. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the probability of recombination occurring during the plating. The probability p of recombination is related to the dilution factor. If the recombination happens once during the plating process, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the dilution.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of recombinants is N * p, where N is the total number of plasmids. In the first half, N = 4 * 10^7, and in the second half, N = 40 * 10^5. The probability p depends on the number of plasmids available and the chance of recombination.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps a simpler way is to use the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into strain K's chromosome, each such integration would reduce the number of plumes from strain B. Similarly, if it integrates into its own chromosome, it won't affect strain B.\n\nGiven that the first half (strain B alone) has fewer plumes than the second half (both strains), it suggests that some of the phages integrated into the other strain's chromosome. The exact number would determine the recombination rate.\n\nSince the answer choices are small percentages, it implies that the recombination is quite low. Looking at the options, 0.05% seems plausible, possibly option J or E. However, given the dilution factors and the numbers, it might be closer to 0.02% (option E) or 0.05%.\n\nI think I need to calculate it more precisely. Suppose R is the recombination rate. The number of plumes from strain K would be proportional to R times the total plumes. From the data, 4 plumes came from K, while 40 came from B. So, 4 = R * 44? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the proportion of plumes from K is R/(R+1). Or perhaps R is the fraction of plumes from K relative to B. Wait, let me think again.\n\nEach time a phage integrates into another's chromosome, it reduces the chance of the lysogenic phage in strain B being detected. So, if x is the recombination rate, then the number of plumes from strain K would be proportional to x times the total plumes. So, 4 = x * (4 + 40). That gives 4 = x*44 \u2192 x\u22480.091, which is approximately 1%, but that's not among the options. Hmm, maybe I'm still off.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful integrations. Since both types are present, some of the lysogenic phages must have integrated into the other strain's chromosome. The ratio of plumes would indicate the proportion of such integrations.\n\nSo, if 4 plumes came from K and 40 from B, the total is 44. The fraction from K is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is close to 10%, but the closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Maybe my calculation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination occurs once during the plating process, and the number of plumes reflects the number of successful integrations. If R is the recombination rate, then the expected number of plumes from K would be R*(N_B + N_K), where N_B and N_K are the plasmids from each strain. Given that N_B = 4 * 10^7 and N_K = 40 * 10^5, the total is 44 * 10^6. The number of plumes from K is 4, so R \u2248 4 / (44 * 10^6) \u2248 9.09e-8, which is less than 1%. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the number of plumes relates to the number of plasmids. If R is the recombination rate, then the number of plumes from K would be R * (N_B + N_K). Solving for R: R = 4 / (4 * 10^7 + 40 * 10^5) = 4 / (44 * 10^6) \u2248 9.09e-8%, which is negligible. Doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers only the relative efficiency of each strain. Strain B has a lower dilution factor (1:10^7) compared to strain K (1:10^5), meaning strain B's plating is more efficient. If strain B's plating resulted in 4 plumes and strain K's in 40, the ratio is 1:10, suggesting that recombination occurred in 10% of cases, but that's too high.\n\nWait, maybe I should reverse the ratios.

If the phages cause lytic fission, then when they infect E. coli, they lyse the bacteria, leading to death. Lysogenic phages don't do that; they integrate their DNA and replicate inside the bacterial particle, allowing replication without lysing the host. So in the first case, where only the lysogenic phage is present, all the E. coli should die because the phages aren't causing lytic fission. However, in reality, we see some dying and some surviving, which indicates that some phages might be causing lysis even when they shouldn't. That would mean that the lysogenic phage could somehow induce lytic fission upon its own replication, perhaps through a recombination event.\n\nNow, in the second part, both types of mutantphages are present. When they're plated on strain B's lawn, most of the E. coli die because the lysogenic phage isn't doing anything harmful, right? But wait, the problem says that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning only a few survive. Then another half is plated on strain K, and 40 plumes appear there. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to focus on the initial experiment where only one type is present.\n\nIn the first scenario, when only the lysogenic phage is present, about half the E. coli die (because the phage doesn't lyse), and the other half survive. But in the actual experiment, only a small number die (4 plumes), while the rest survive. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow inducing lytic fission, possibly due to recombination with another mutation elsewhere in the T_4 genome. Recombination would create a new mutation that allows the phage to lyse the host.\n\nWhen both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly killed (only 60% die?), but when plated on strain K, more survive (40 plumes instead of 60). Wait, the numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. So when both are present, B has fewer survivors than when only one is present. That makes sense because the presence of a phage that can lyse E. coli (from the lysogenic mutation) would kill more of the E. coli, reducing the number that can reproduce, hence fewer survivors.\n\nBut how does recombination come into play? Let's recall that recombination events between different T_4 mutations can lead to new recombinant mutations that may have beneficial effects. In this case, the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to induce lytic fission. Recombination between this lysogenic mutation and another mutation in the same T_4 gene would produce a recombinant mutation that can lyse the host. \n\nThe key point is that recombination increases the chance of the mutation being active. The probability of recombination is inversely related to the likelihood of the product mutation occurring. If the recombination rate is high, then the probability of a recombinant mutation appearing is higher, which would increase the survival rate of the host.\n\nGiven that, in the experiment, when both mutant types are present, the number of survivors on strain K increased from 40 (when only one type was present) to 40, but that seems contradictory. Wait, let me clarify. When only one type is present, say lysogenic, the E. coli dies except for 40 survivors. But when both are present, E. coli die more, but when plated on K, more survive. Wait, the exact numbers are important.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n- Half plates: dilution 1:10^7, plated on strain B.\n- Other half: dilution 1:10^5, plated on strain K.\n\nResults:\n\n- On B: 4 plumes (survivors).\n- On K: 40 plumes.\n\nSo, when only lysogenic is present, E. coli on B die except 60% survive (assuming dilution 1:10^7, so 10^7 plumes per microliter). Similarly, when both are present, the E. coli on B die more, but when plated on K, more survive.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning few survive. Then another half is plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes on K and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, that suggests that when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K have 40 survivors, whereas on B, they have 40 as well. Wait, but that contradicts the initial expectation. Alternatively, maybe the numbers refer to plumes on K being 40 and on B being 40, but the total number of plumes depends on the dilution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when only one type is present, the number of survivors is 40 (plumes), and when both are present, on K, there are 40 plumes, but on B, also 40. That implies that when only one type is present, 40 E. coli survive, and when both are present, 40 on B and 40 on K. But that doesn't seem to make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the numbers represent the count of successful infections.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that when only one type is present, the number of surviving E. coli is 40, and when both are present, on strain K, 40 plumes occur, implying 40 successful infections. But I'm not sure about the exact interpretation.\n\nAnyway, the main idea is that the presence of both mutant types leads to increased survival of E. coli on K compared to B, suggesting that some form of recombination or synergistic effect between the two mutations occurred, enhancing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q - pq)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of one mutation, q the frequency of the other, and pq is the frequency of the recombinant mutation. However, in our case, we're dealing with phenotypic frequencies rather than genetic probabilities.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of recombinant to wild-type or non-recombinant types. Since we have four plumes on K and none on B, perhaps the presence of both mutants is necessary for the recombining event to work, thus increasing the survival rate.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to estimate the probability of recombination. Given that when both mutants are present, the number of survivors on K is higher than when only one is present, it suggests that the combination of both mutants promotes the lysogenic phenotype.\n\nAssuming that the recombination fraction (recombination rate) affects the expression of the recombinant mutation. The expected number of recombinants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = (1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)) * Total Plumes\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Alternatively, considering the survival rates:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present, E. coli on B die except 40 survive. When both are present, on B, they die more, but on K, they survive more. So the combined presence of both mutants enhances the survival rate on K.\n\nIf we assume that the recombination frequency is r, then the probability of a recombinant mutation appearing is r/(1-r). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of odds: when both mutants are present, the survival rate on K increases, indicating that the recombination provides an additional advantage.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look at the ratio of the plumes. The number of plumes on K is 40, and on B it's 40 as well, but the presence of both mutants on K leads to more survivors. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to more effective lytic fission on K, thus decreasing the number of survivors.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are misleading. Let me try to outline the data clearly:\n\n- When only the lysogenic phage is present, E. coli on B:\n   - Survived: 60%\n   - Died: 40%\n\n- When both lysogenic and the other mutant are present on B:\n   - Survived: 40%\n\n- When both are present on K:\n   - Survived: 40%\n\nThis suggests that the presence of both mutants on B reduces survival, but on K, it doesn't. Therefore, the recombination event must enhance the survival on K, making it less likely for E. coli to die.\n\nIf the recombination event produces a recombinant mutation that allows the phage to lyse the host, then having both mutants on K would result in a higher survival rate than either alone. Conversely, on B, which lacks the recombination event, the phage cannot lyse, leading to lower survival.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both mutants on K introduces the recombination event, which improves the survival rate, while on B, the absence of this event leads to lower survival.\n\nNow, to determine the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = frequency of lysogenic mutation in T_4\n- q = frequency of the other mutation in T_4\n- r = recombination frequency\n\nThe probability of a recombinant mutation is approximately r/(1 - r).\n\nHowever, in the context of the problem, the key is that the combination of both mutants leads to enhanced survival on K, suggesting that the recombination event is advantageous.\n\nAssuming that the survival on K is proportional to the probability of the recombination event, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)) = 1 - (probability of neither mutation) = probability of at least one mutation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that when both mutants are present, the survival rate on K is 40%, while on B, it's 40% as well. Wait, that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to model the survival rates based on the presence of recombination.\n\nOn B:\n- Only lysogenic phage: survival = 60%\n- Both mutants: survival = 40%\n\nThus, the loss in survival is due to the inability to lyse the host, which is linked to the recombination event.\n\nSimilarly, on K:\n- Only lysogenic phage: survival = 60%\n- Both mutants: survival = 40%\n\nSame pattern, but why does K have the same survival rate as B?\n\nWait, perhaps the survival rate on K is the same regardless of whether the recombination event occurs because the presence of both mutants doesn't change the overall effect on K. Or maybe the issue lies in the recombination itself.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when both mutations are present, the survival rate on K is 40%, which is lower than when only one is present (60%). This suggests that the recombination event enhances the survival on K, while on B, the lack of recombination doesn't affect the survival as much.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency can be estimated based on the difference in survival rates.\n\nAssuming that the survival rate on K is reduced by the presence of both mutants, and on B, it's the same as when only one is present.\n\nWait, that might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination event reduces the survival rate on B, while it doesn't affect K as much. But in the data, both have the same reduction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination event provides an advantage on both strains, but the observed decrease in survival on K is due to the fact that the recombination event is more favorable on K.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of the recombination event, thereby affecting the survival rate.\n\nThe problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. To find this, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - [(Probability of no recombination) / (Probability of any recombination)]\n\nBut in this case, we can approximate it using the ratio of the number of survivors.\n\nWhen only one type is present, the number of survivors is 40 on B. When both are present, on K, the number of survivors is 40. Wait, that doesn't make sense. It suggests that the presence of both mutants doesn't increase the number of survivors beyond what was seen on B. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify the experimental data again:\n\n- First scenario: Only lysogenic phage is present. E. coli on B: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n- Second scenario: Both mutant types are present. E. coli on B: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n- Third scenario: Both mutant types are present. E. coli on K: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n\nWait, that still doesn't explain it. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers indicate that when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K have 40 survivors, while on B, they have 40 as well, which doesn't make sense unless the presence of the other mutant affects B differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the proportion of colonies that died. For example, when only lysogenic is present, 40% die (so 60% survive). When both are present, on B, 40% die (same as before), but on K, 40% die as well. That doesn't explain the difference.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when both mutants are present, on K, the number of survivors is 40, while on B, it's 40 as well. That suggests that the presence of both mutants doesn't change the survival rate on K compared to B, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are indicating the number of plumes, not survivors. Each plume represents an individual infection. So on B, 4 plumes (independently) represent 40 survivors, while on K, 40 plumes represent 40 survivors. That would imply that the presence of both mutants increases the survival rate on K relative to B. But why would that happen? Because when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K survive better, suggesting that the recombination event is beneficial on K.\n\nGiven that, the presence of both mutants on K leads to a higher survival rate than when only one is present on B. Therefore, the recombination event must provide a benefit, such as enabling the phage to lyse the host.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nThe probability of recombination is r, and the probability of a recombinant mutation is approximately r/(1 - r) \u2248 r when r is small.\n\nGiven that the presence of both mutants on K leads to a higher survival rate, we can assume that the recombination event is advantageous on K.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants can be calculated as:\n\nExpected recombinants = (1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)) * Total Plumes\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the survival rate on K is proportional to the probability of the recombination event, we can set up the equation:\n\n(Survival Rate on K) = (1 - (1 - p)(1 - q))\n\nSimilarly, on B, the survival rate is:\n\n(Survival Rate on B) = (1 - p)\n\nGiven that on K, the survival rate is the same as on B (both 60%), that can't be right unless p is zero, which it isn't.\n\nWait, that suggests that the survival rates are the same, which would mean that the presence of both mutants doesn't affect the survival rate on K, contradicting the observation that on K, 40 survivors occur on plumes, while on B, 40 as well. Therefore, my previous assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when both mutants are present, the survival rate on K increases because the recombination event leads to a higher expression of the recombinant mutation, which allows the phage to lyse the host. Therefore, the presence of both mutants on K makes the phage more effective, leading to higher survival.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency can be approximated by considering the difference in survival rates. Since on K, the survival rate is the same as on B despite the presence of both mutants, it suggests that the recombination event doesn't affect K, which contradicts the observation. Therefore, perhaps the survival rate on K decreases slightly due to the recombination event.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the recombination frequency is r, and the survival rate on K is 40%, while on B, it's 60%. We can use these percentages to solve for r.\n\nUsing the formula for survival rate:\n\nSurvival Rate = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nBut since we're dealing with recombination, p and q are related to r. Assuming that the frequency of the non-recombined allele is (1 - r)/(1 + r), but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the recombination event increases the survival rate on K, we can model the survival rate as:\n\nS_K = S_B + (R * R\u0304)\n\nWhere R is the recombination fraction and R\u0304 is the non-recombination fraction. But I'm not fully confident about this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll take a guess that the correct answer is B. 2 percent, as it corresponds to a low recombination frequency, indicating minimal recombination events.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have multiple plumes, it means multiple infections happened.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. If the phages cause lytic fission, then when they infect E. coli, they lyse the bacteria, leading to death. Lysogenic phages don't do that; they integrate their DNA and replicate inside the bacterial particle, allowing replication without lysing the host. So in the first case, where only the lysogenic phage is present, all the E. coli should die because the phages aren't causing lytic fission. However, in reality, we see some dying and some surviving, which indicates that some phages might be causing lysis even when they shouldn't. That would mean that the lysogenic phage could somehow induce lytic fission upon its own replication, perhaps through a recombination event.\n\nNow, in the second part, both types of mutantphages are present. When they're plated on strain B's lawn, most of the E. coli die because the lysogenic phage isn't doing anything harmful, right? But wait, the problem says that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning only a few survive. Then another half is plated on strain K, and 40 plumes appear there. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to focus on the initial experiment where only one type is present.\n\nIn the first scenario, when only the lysogenic phage is present, about half the E. coli die (because the phage doesn't lyse), and the other half survive. But in the actual experiment, only a small number die (4 plumes), while the rest survive. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow inducing lytic fission, possibly due to recombination with another mutation elsewhere in the T_4 genome. Recombination would create a new mutation that allows the phage to lyse the host.\n\nWhen both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly killed (only 60% die?), but when plated on strain K, more survive (40 plumes instead of 60). Wait, the numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. So when both are present, B has fewer survivors than when only one is present. That makes sense because the presence of a phage that can lyse E. coli (from the lysogenic mutation) would kill more of the E. coli, reducing the number that can reproduce, hence fewer survivors.\n\nBut how does recombination come into play? Let's recall that recombination events between different T_4 mutations can lead to new recombinant mutations that may have beneficial effects. In this case, the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to induce lytic fission. Recombination between this lysogenic mutation and another mutation in the same T_4 gene would produce a recombinant mutation that can lyse the host. \n\nThe key point is that recombination increases the chance of the mutation being active. The probability of recombination is inversely related to the likelihood of the product mutation occurring. If the recombination rate is high, then the probability of a recombinant mutation appearing is higher, which would increase the survival rate of the host.\n\nGiven that, in the experiment, when both mutant types are present, the number of survivors on strain K increased from 40 (when only one type was present) to 40, but that seems contradictory. Wait, let me clarify. When only one type is present, say lysogenic, the E. coli dies except for 40 survivors. But when both are present, E. coli die more, but when plated on K, more survive. Wait, the exact numbers are important.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n- Half plates: dilution 1:10^7, plated on strain B.\n- Other half: dilution 1:10^5, plated on strain K.\n\nResults:\n\n- On B: 4 plumes (survivors).\n- On K: 40 plumes.\n\nSo, when only lysogenic is present, E. coli on B die except 60% survive (assuming dilution 1:10^7, so 10^7 plumes per microliter). Similarly, when both are present, the E. coli on B die more, but when plated on K, more survive.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning few survive. Then another half is plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes on K and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, that suggests that when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K have 40 survivors, whereas on B, they have 40 as well. Wait, but that contradicts the initial expectation. Alternatively, maybe the numbers refer to plumes on K being 40 and on B being 40, but the total number of plumes depends on the dilution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when only one type is present, the number of survivors is 40 (plumes), and when both are present, on K, there are 40 plumes, but on B, also 40. That implies that when only one type is present, 40 E. coli survive, and when both are present, 40 on B and 40 on K. But that doesn't seem to make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the numbers represent the count of successful infections.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that when only one type is present, the number of surviving E. coli is 40, and when both are present, on strain K, 40 plumes occur, implying 40 successful infections. But I'm not sure about the exact interpretation.\n\nAnyway, the main idea is that the presence of both mutant types leads to increased survival of E. coli on K compared to B, suggesting that some form of recombination or synergistic effect between the two mutations occurred, enhancing the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q - pq)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of one mutation, q the frequency of the other, and pq is the frequency of the recombinant mutation. However, in our case, we're dealing with phenotypic frequencies rather than genetic probabilities.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of recombinant to wild-type or non-recombinant types. Since we have four plumes on K and none on B, perhaps the presence of both mutants is necessary for the recombining event to work, thus increasing the survival rate.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to estimate the probability of recombination. Given that when both mutants are present, the number of survivors on K is higher than when only one is present, it suggests that the combination of both mutants promotes the lysogenic phenotype.\n\nAssuming that the recombination fraction (recombination rate) affects the expression of the recombinant mutation.

Alternatively, considering the survival rates:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present, E. coli on B die except 40 survive. When both are present, on B, they die more, but on K, they survive more. So the combined presence of both mutants enhances the survival rate on K.\n\nIf we assume that the recombination frequency is r, then the probability of a recombinant mutation appearing is r/(1-r).

The number of plumes on K is 40, and on B it's 40 as well, but the presence of both mutants on K leads to more survivors. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to more effective lytic fission on K, thus decreasing the number of survivors.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are misleading. Let me try to outline the data clearly:\n\n- When only the lysogenic phage is present, E. coli on B:\n   - Survived: 60%\n   - Died: 40%\n\n- When both lysogenic and the other mutant are present on B:\n   - Survived: 40%\n\n- When both are present on K:\n   - Survived: 40%\n\nThis suggests that the presence of both mutants on B reduces survival, but on K, it doesn't. Therefore, the recombination event must enhance the survival on K, making it less likely for E. coli to die.\n\nIf the recombination event produces a recombinant mutation that allows the phage to lyse the host, then having both mutants on K would result in a higher survival rate than either alone.

Or maybe the issue lies in the recombination itself.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when both mutations are present, the survival rate on K is 40%, which is lower than when only one is present (60%). This suggests that the recombination event enhances the survival on K, while on B, the lack of recombination doesn't affect the survival as much.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency can be estimated based on the difference in survival rates.\n\nAssuming that the survival rate on K is reduced by the presence of both mutants, and on B, it's the same as when only one is present.\n\nWait, that might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination event reduces the survival rate on B, while it doesn't affect K as much. But in the data, both have the same reduction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination event provides an advantage on both strains, but the observed decrease in survival on K is due to the fact that the recombination event is more favorable on K.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of the recombination event, thereby affecting the survival rate.\n\nThe problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. To find this, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - [(Probability of no recombination) / (Probability of any recombination)]\n\nBut in this case, we can approximate it using the ratio of the number of survivors.\n\nWhen only one type is present, the number of survivors is 40 on B. When both are present, on K, the number of survivors is 40. Wait, that doesn't make sense. It suggests that the presence of both mutants doesn't increase the number of survivors beyond what was seen on B. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify the experimental data again:\n\n- First scenario: Only lysogenic phage is present. E. coli on B: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n- Second scenario: Both mutant types are present. E. coli on B: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n- Third scenario: Both mutant types are present. E. coli on K: 40 survivors, 60 deaths.\n\nWait, that still doesn't explain it. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers indicate that when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K have 40 survivors, while on B, they have 40 as well, which doesn't make sense unless the presence of the other mutant affects B differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the proportion of colonies that died. For example, when only lysogenic is present, 40% die (so 60% survive). When both are present, on B, 40% die (same as before), but on K, 40% die as well. That doesn't explain the difference.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when both mutants are present, on K, the number of survivors is 40, while on B, it's 40 as well. That suggests that the presence of both mutants doesn't change the survival rate on K compared to B, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are indicating the number of plumes, not survivors. Each plume represents an individual infection. So on B, 4 plumes (independently) represent 40 survivors, while on K, 40 plumes represent 40 survivors. That would imply that the presence of both mutants increases the survival rate on K relative to B. But why would that happen? Because when both mutants are present, the E. coli on K survive better, suggesting that the recombination event is beneficial on K.\n\nGiven that, the presence of both mutants on K leads to a higher survival rate than when only one is present on B. Therefore, the recombination event must provide a benefit, such as enabling the phage to lyse the host.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach:\n\nThe probability of recombination is r, and the probability of a recombinant mutation is approximately r/(1 - r) \u2248 r when r is small.\n\nGiven that the presence of both mutants on K leads to a higher survival rate, we can assume that the recombination event is advantageous on K.\n\nThe expected number of recombinants can be calculated as:\n\nExpected recombinants = (1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)) * Total Plumes\n\nBut without knowing p and q, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the survival rate on K is proportional to the probability of the recombination event, we can set up the equation:\n\n(Survival Rate on K) = (1 - (1 - p)(1 - q))\n\nSimilarly, on B, the survival rate is:\n\n(Survival Rate on B) = (1 - p)\n\nGiven that on K, the survival rate is the same as on B (both 60%), that can't be right unless p is zero, which it isn't.\n\nWait, that suggests that the survival rates are the same, which would mean that the presence of both mutants doesn't affect the survival rate on K, contradicting the observation that on K, 40 survivors occur on plumes, while on B, 40 as well. Therefore, my previous assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when both mutants are present, the survival rate on K increases because the recombination event leads to a higher expression of the recombinant mutation, which allows the phage to lyse the host. Therefore, the presence of both mutants on K makes the phage more effective, leading to higher survival.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency can be approximated by considering the difference in survival rates. Since on K, the survival rate is the same as on B despite the presence of both mutants, it suggests that the recombination event doesn't affect K, which contradicts the observation. Therefore, perhaps the survival rate on K decreases slightly due to the recombination event.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the recombination frequency is r, and the survival rate on K is 40%, while on B, it's 60%. We can use these percentages to solve for r.\n\nUsing the formula for survival rate:\n\nSurvival Rate = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nBut since we're dealing with recombination, p and q are related to r. Assuming that the frequency of the non-recombined allele is (1 - r)/(1 + r), but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the recombination event increases the survival rate on K, we can model the survival rate as:\n\nS_K = S_B + (R * R\u0304)\n\nWhere R is the recombination fraction and R\u0304 is the non-recombination fraction. But I'm not fully confident about this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll take a guess that the correct answer is B. 2 percent, as it corresponds to a low recombination frequency, indicating minimal recombination events.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

    "rollout": " So 40 plumes on B mean more infections than on K. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about what happens during phage lysis. If a phage mutates and becomes lysogenic, it will lyse the E. coli cells, causing them to die. However, if another mutation makes it lytic, it would replicate inside the cell, leading to more phage particles, which would cause further lytic events, potentially leading to quelling (all phages dying) if the mutation occurs in all phages.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the E. coli, but perhaps the lytic phage could lyse again if it replicates inside. But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission; it causes lysogenic. So maybe the lytic phage from the lysogenic mutation would lyse the E. coli, but if there's a second mutation making it lytic, then it could lyse again. Hmm, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the concept of recombination between mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic elements within a single phage. For example, in T_4 phages, different genes might be present in a single phage, and their combination can lead to new outcomes. In double phage experiments, recombination can affect whether both mutations are present or not in the offspring phage.\n\nThe key point here is determining how many times the two mutations occurred together in the offspring. Since the phages are being plated on different strains, we're looking at whether the combined mutations result in a lytic or lysogenic phage.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when the lysogenic phage (which doesn't cause lytic fission) is mixed with a lytic phage (which does), it leads to quelling. Quelling means that all the phages die. So in the initial experiment, mixing the two types of phages caused quelling in strain B, meaning no infections happened because the lysogenic phage didn't lyse, and the lytic phage replicated inside.\n\nHowever, in the second part, when both types are present, the result was that half of the bacteria died, and half survived. That suggests that some of the phages led to infections, but others didn't. Specifically, four plates were found on strain K, and 40 on strain B. Wait, that seems off because 40 is much higher than 4. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbers. Perhaps \"plated\" refers to the number of phages, not the number of bacteria. Alternatively, maybe the dilution factors indicate the concentration of phages relative to the bacterial population.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The first half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. Dilution factor D=1e-7 means the concentration of phages is 1e-7 per bacterium. Plating density affects the likelihood of infection. Similarly, the other half was diluted 1:1e5 and plated on strain K.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage (from type A) and the lytic phage (type B) are mixed, they produce quellings. Therefore, any mixture containing both types would result in death of the phages, leading to no infection. But in reality, if a mixture contains the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse), it would cause death. However, the other mutation may still cause a lytic effect.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for double reciprocal plating. The ratio of plumes gives information about the presence of certain combinations. The formula is:\n\nln(\u03bb1 / \u03bb2) = - (x1 + x2) ln(D)\n\nWhere \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the concentrations of the two mutations, and D is the dilution factor. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here directly.\n\nAlternatively, using the double reciprocal method, the ratio of plumes indicates the frequency of the specific combination. The formula is:\n\nR = (number of plumes on strain X) / (number of plumes on strain Y)\n\nWhere R is the ratio indicating the occurrence of the specific combination. If the ratio is high, it means that combination occurs frequently. Conversely, a low ratio means it rarely occurs.\n\nIn our case, the first half was plated on strain B, expecting only the lysogenic phage to cause death. The second half was plated on strain K, and the outcome was 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. Wait, that seems like a lot more plumes on K, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is less common there.

    "rollout": " So four plumes mean four new phages have entered the bacterial population, right?\n\nRecombination would lead to more successful infections because the phages can integrate their genes better, potentially leading to higher fitness effects. If two mutations are linked, recombination should increase the chance of successful infection. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B was effective, while the non-lytic phage caused breakdown. However, when both types were present, only the lysogenic one worked. That suggests that the non-lytic phage might be causing issues when combined with others. \n\nThe initial division probably happened due to recombination between the two types of phages. Since the non-lytic phage caused damage when used alone, it must have been involved in recombining with the lysogenic phage. Recombination typically increases the number of functional recombinants, which in this case, led to fewer plumes on strain B (which had the non-lytic mutation) compared to strain K (which had the lysogenic mutation). \n\nThe dilution factors are important here. The first group was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each plate has 1e-7 cells, whereas the second was 1:10^5, which is 1e-5 cells per plate. These differences affect how many phages successfully infect and replicate. The presence of 40 plumes on B and 4 on K suggests that when the phages were under lower dilution (1e-7), the non-lytic mutation was more likely to cause a problem, leading to fewer successful infections. Conversely, under higher dilution (1e-5), recombination increased, allowing more phages to survive and reproduce, hence more plumes on K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula: Recombination Frequency = 1 - (Proportion of recombinant individuals). Here, the proportion of recombinants would correspond to the plumes. So if there are 40 plumes on B (recombinant) and 4 on K (non-recombinant), the total is 44. Assuming all plumes represent recombination events, the frequency would be 40/44 \u2248 90%. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is different because the dilutions are different. The first group (1e-7) would have fewer plumes than the second group (1e-5). \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the probability of recombination occurring during the replication of phages. Each time a phage replicates, there's a chance that a recombination event occurs. The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. Under low dilution, fewer plumes occur, suggesting less recombination, while at higher dilution, more recombination leads to more plumes. \n\nGiven that under 1e-7 dilution, there are 40 plumes, and under 1e-5, 4 plumes, the difference in dilution factor is 10^5 / 10^7 = 1e-2, which is a 1% change. This suggests that recombination occurred with a frequency related to the dilution. Using the formula for recombination frequency, F = 1 - log(\u03c0), where \u03c0 is the probability of recombination. If the observed recombinants are 40/44\u224890%, then \u03c0=0.9, so F=1 - log10(0.9)\u22481 - (-0.0458)=1.0458. But this doesn't make sense because F should be \u22641. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, 40 vs. 4, the probability of recombination is 40/(40+4)=86.67%. Using the formula F = 1 - (plume_ratio / (plume_ratio + 1)), where plume_ratio = 40/4=10. Then F=1 - (10/11)\u22489.09%. But again, this seems too high. Maybe using the formula F = ln(plume_ratio)/ln(2) gives F= ln(10)/ln(2)\u22483.32, which isn't possible either. I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to think about the likelihood of recombination affecting the outcome. If the two mutations were independent, the chance that recombination occurs would be low. But in reality, if they're linked, recombination increases the chances of successful replication. Given that under lower dilution, fewer plumes, which implies less recombination, but in our case, under lower dilution, more plumes? Wait, no\u2014under lower dilution, you expect fewer successful infections because the phages are more numerous. But in our case, under 1e-7 dilution, 40 plumes; under 1e-5, 4. So as dilution increases, the number of plumes decreases, implying that recombination is happening more frequently as the phages are replicated more often.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both mutants were present, only the lysogenic one worked. Without recombination, the non-lytic phage would cause problems. Recombination introduced integration of the gene, making the phage fit better, thus surviving and causing fewer plumes. So the recombination frequency should be such that the number of plumes reflects the increase in successful infections due to integration.\n\nIf the expected number without recombination is N, and with recombination, it's higher, say M > N. The ratio M/N would indicate how much recombination occurred. Here, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So assuming that when recombination occurs, the number of plumes increases, perhaps inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nWait, let me try calculating the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nF = 1 - log10((number of recombinant individuals)/(total individuals))\n\nHere, recombinant individuals are those that integrated the gene, so on B, 40, and on K, 4.

Alternatively, maybe it's the reciprocal: F = log10(total / recombinants) \u2248 log10(44/40)=log10(1.1)=0.0414, so approximately 0.04%, which is 0.04%, close to option G (0.5%) or J (0.05%). Hmm.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested 40/44\u224890% recombinants, which would imply F=1 - log10(0.909)=~1.045, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinants. So 40 plumes on B (recombinant) and 4 on K (non-recombinant). Total recombinants=44. Thus, the proportion is 40/44\u224890.9%, which would suggest a high recombination rate. But how does this relate to the actual recombination frequency?\n\nUsing the formula F = 1 - log10(\u03c0), where \u03c0 is the probability of recombination. If \u03c0=0.909, then F=1 - log10(0.909)= ~1.045, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps F=ln(\u03c0)/ln(2), but that also doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe another approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes given the recombination frequency. Suppose the recombination frequency is F, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would be 40 * (1/F). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.05% (option J), given that the plume count matches closely to a scenario where recombination occurs at a small frequency. For example, if F=0.04% (0.0004), then the expected number of recombinant plumes would be 44*0.0004\u22480.0176, which is nowhere near 40. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. If the number of plumes on B is 40 and on K is 4, and the total is 44, then the proportion of recombinant is 40/44\u224890.9%. If this is the probability of recombination, then F=1 - log10(0.909)=1 - (-0.045)=1.045, which is still incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is F = ln(p)/ln(2), where p is the probability of recombination.

Maybe I should look up the formula for recombination frequency based on plume counts. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.05% (J), as it's the closest to the observed data.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So four plumes mean four new phages have entered the bacterial population, right?\n\nRecombination would lead to more successful infections because the phages can integrate their genes better, potentially leading to higher fitness effects. If two mutations are linked, recombination should increase the chance of successful infection. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B was effective, while the non-lytic phage caused breakdown. However, when both types were present, only the lysogenic one worked. That suggests that the non-lytic phage might be causing issues when combined with others. \n\nThe initial division probably happened due to recombination between the two types of phages. Since the non-lytic phage caused damage when used alone, it must have been involved in recombining with the lysogenic phage. Recombination typically increases the number of functional recombinants, which in this case, led to fewer plumes on strain B (which had the non-lytic mutation) compared to strain K (which had the lysogenic mutation). \n\nThe dilution factors are important here. The first group was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each plate has 1e-7 cells, whereas the second was 1:10^5, which is 1e-5 cells per plate. These differences affect how many phages successfully infect and replicate. The presence of 40 plumes on B and 4 on K suggests that when the phages were under lower dilution (1e-7), the non-lytic mutation was more likely to cause a problem, leading to fewer successful infections. Conversely, under higher dilution (1e-5), recombination increased, allowing more phages to survive and reproduce, hence more plumes on K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula: Recombination Frequency = 1 - (Proportion of recombinant individuals). Here, the proportion of recombinants would correspond to the plumes. So if there are 40 plumes on B (recombinant) and 4 on K (non-recombinant), the total is 44. Assuming all plumes represent recombination events, the frequency would be 40/44 \u2248 90%. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is different because the dilutions are different. The first group (1e-7) would have fewer plumes than the second group (1e-5). \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the probability of recombination occurring during the replication of phages. Each time a phage replicates, there's a chance that a recombination event occurs. The number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. Under low dilution, fewer plumes occur, suggesting less recombination, while at higher dilution, more recombination leads to more plumes. \n\nGiven that under 1e-7 dilution, there are 40 plumes, and under 1e-5, 4 plumes, the difference in dilution factor is 10^5 / 10^7 = 1e-2, which is a 1% change. This suggests that recombination occurred with a frequency related to the dilution. Using the formula for recombination frequency, F = 1 - log(\u03c0), where \u03c0 is the probability of recombination. If the observed recombinants are 40/44\u224890%, then \u03c0=0.9, so F=1 - log10(0.9)\u22481 - (-0.0458)=1.0458. But this doesn't make sense because F should be \u22641. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, 40 vs. 4, the probability of recombination is 40/(40+4)=86.67%. Using the formula F = 1 - (plume_ratio / (plume_ratio + 1)), where plume_ratio = 40/4=10. Then F=1 - (10/11)\u22489.09%. But again, this seems too high. Maybe using the formula F = ln(plume_ratio)/ln(2) gives F= ln(10)/ln(2)\u22483.32, which isn't possible either. I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to think about the likelihood of recombination affecting the outcome. If the two mutations were independent, the chance that recombination occurs would be low. But in reality, if they're linked, recombination increases the chances of successful replication. Given that under lower dilution, fewer plumes, which implies less recombination, but in our case, under lower dilution, more plumes? Wait, no\u2014under lower dilution, you expect fewer successful infections because the phages are more numerous. But in our case, under 1e-7 dilution, 40 plumes; under 1e-5, 4. So as dilution increases, the number of plumes decreases, implying that recombination is happening more frequently as the phages are replicated more often.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both mutants were present, only the lysogenic one worked. Without recombination, the non-lytic phage would cause problems. Recombination introduced integration of the gene, making the phage fit better, thus surviving and causing fewer plumes. So the recombination frequency should be such that the number of plumes reflects the increase in successful infections due to integration.\n\nIf the expected number without recombination is N, and with recombination, it's higher, say M > N. The ratio M/N would indicate how much recombination occurred. Here, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So assuming that when recombination occurs, the number of plumes increases, perhaps inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nWait, let me try calculating the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nF = 1 - log10((number of recombinant individuals)/(total individuals))\n\nHere, recombinant individuals are those that integrated the gene, so on B, 40, and on K, 4.

Similarly, 40 plumes on B indicate 40 phages integrated into strain B.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Actually, when you plate a phage on a bacterial lawn, any new phages will cause a plume. So in this case, the E. coli is being used as the lawn for each treatment. So if you plate the phages on strain B, any successful integration would produce a plume. Similarly, if you plate them on strain K, any successful integration would produce a plume. So the number of plumes indicates how many phages have successfully integrated into each bacteria.\n\nBut wait, in this experiment, the phages are from different strains, so their integration might interfere. However, the problem states that both types of phages are present, so perhaps the recombination refers to how the two mutation types interact during phage lysis.\n\nThe key here is that only the lysogenic phage caused the lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage can integrate into the T_4 genome. If there was recombination, it would mean that the lysogenic phage has incorporated a mutation from the lysogenic phage, possibly into the T_4 DNA.\n\nIn experiments where multiple phages are present, the occurrence of successful integration in one strain can influence the success in another due to recombination. For example, if the lysogenic phage has incorporated a mutation from the phage that caused the lytic fission, then it might be less likely to integrate into strain B but more likely into strain K.\n\nLooking at the data: In the first plate, the phages are all lysogenic because only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission. So all the phages are lysogenic. They're plated on strain B's lawn, so any successful integration should lead to a plume on B. But the result showed 40 plumes on B. That seems high. Wait, no, actually, when you plate lysogenic phages on a strain, they either lyse the cell or replicate without causing a plume. Since these are lysogenic phages, they replicate and don't lyse, so they shouldn't cause a plume. Therefore, the presence of plumes on B must come from the phages that are not lysogenic but somehow integrated into the T_4 genome. But that contradicts the initial statement that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in the genomic region called rII.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII, which affects its ability to integrate into the T_4 genome. So when the lysogenic phage integrates, it may disrupt the T_4 genome, leading to a lytic fission instead of lysogenic. However, the phages carrying the lysogenic mutation may also have a mutation in rII that prevents them from integrating into the T_4 genome. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that allows it to integrate into the T_4 despite being lysogenic.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible outcomes. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, it may lose its ability to integrate into the T_4 genome. So when it integrates, it could become a lysogenic phage again, which would lyse the cell. But if it retains the mutation, it might still integrate but cause lytic fission. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage could have a mutation that stops it from integrating into the T_4 genome, meaning it doesn't replicate.\n\nBut according to the problem, the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, so it must replicate without losing the mutation in rII. Therefore, the lysogenic phage does integrate into the T_4 genome but doesn't disrupt it, allowing it to replicate. Now, if we mix two types of phages, some with and some without the mutation, the integration process might be influenced by recombination. Recombination would explain why some phages integrate without the mutation and others do when mixed.\n\nNow, looking at the data: The first plate (strains B) had 40 plumes. Assuming that all the phages in this plate are lysogenic (since only lysogenic cause lytic), but some of them might have the mutation in rII. If the mutation in rII leads to loss of integrase (the enzyme that allows phage integration), then the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing the mutation. Wait, but the lysogenic phage itself has the mutation in rII, which might affect its ability to integrate.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage integrates normally but has a mutation in rII that prevents it from replicating, then when mixed with another lysogenic phage that lacks this mutation, it won't replicate and thus won't cause a plume. But if they're mixed together, the integration process might be influenced by recombination.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the number of recombinant individuals would correspond to the number of phages that have successfully integrated into the T_4 genome but lost the mutation. The total offspring would be the sum of the successful integrations in each strain.\n\nBut in our case, all the phages in the first plate (on strain B) are lysogenic, so they should integrate without disrupting the T_4. However, some might have lost the mutation in rII, making them unable to integrate properly. These would replicate without causing a plume.\n\nWhen these are plated on strain K, any phages that cannot integrate would cause a plume. But the data shows that on strain K, only 40 plumes were observed, whereas on strain B, 40 plumes were seen. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, the first plate was on strain B, and the second on strain K. The counts were 40 on K and 40 on B? No, the user wrote \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nWait, no, the user says: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, meaning 40 phages successfully integrated into strain B. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found, meaning 4 phages successfully integrated into strain K.\n\nSince the phages in the first sample are all lysogenic (because only lysogenic cause lytic fission), they should integrate into the T_4 genome. However, some of them might have a mutation in rII that prevents them from replicating, meaning they wouldn't cause a plume even though they integrate.\n\nTherefore, on strain B's lawn, the 40 plumes correspond to phages that successfully integrated but did not replicate (due to the mutation in rII). On strain K's lawn, the 4 plumes correspond to phages that successfully replicated (no mutation in rII).\n\nNow, considering the experiment where both types of phages are present, the recombination frequency would determine how much of the lysogenic phage's mutation caused disruption. The number of recombined plumes would depend on how many phages lost the mutation upon mixing.\n\nIf the mutation in rII is rare, the chance that a lysogenic phage loses it upon mixing would be low. Therefore, the number of recombined plumes (those that lost the mutation) would be small relative to the total number of plumes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- R = number of recombined plumes (lost mutation)\n- S = number of intact plumes (didn\u2019t lose mutation)\n\nTotal plumes on B: R + S = 40\nPlumes on K: Only those that didn't lose the mutation would cause a plume, but wait, K's phages are not lysogenic because the original phages in the first sample were lysogenic. So all phages on K's lawn are non-lysogenic, meaning they don't cause plumes. Wait, no, the phages on K's lawn are non-lysogenic, so they don't cause plumes regardless of mutation. But the user said four plumes on K, which confuses me.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The initial phages are a mixture of lysogenic and non-lysogenic. The lysogenic ones cause lytic fission, while the non-lysogenic ones don't. So when plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause a plume. The non-lysogenic phages, if present, would not cause a plume, but in the experiment, the phages are mixed before plating, so the non-lysogenic ones remain undetectable.\n\nWait, but the user says that when the phages are mixed, the result was 40 on K and 4 on B. So perhaps the non-lysogenic phages remain undetectable, but the lysogenic ones cause plumes. So on strain B's lawn, only the lysogenic phages cause plumes, and on strain K's lawn, the same lysogenic phages don't cause plumes because they don't integrate.\n\nBut the user's description says that when the phages are plated on strain B, 40 plumes are found. This suggests that some of the phages integrated but lost the mutation, resulting in no replication. So when these are plated on strain K, which is a different T_4 genome, the integration occurs without the mutation, causing a plume. However, the data shows 4 plumes on K, which implies that 4 phages successfully integrated without the mutation. But if the lysogenic phages in the first sample already lost the mutation upon integration, then they shouldn't integrate again on strain K.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. The recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nIn this context, the number of recombinant individuals would be the number of phages that successfully integrated into the T_4 genome but lost the mutation in rII, leading to no replication. The total number of offspring would be the sum of all successful integrations on both strains.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- Strain B's lawn: 40 plumes \u2192 40 phages successfully integrated but lost the mutation.\n- Strain K's lawn: 4 plumes \u2192 4 phages successfully integrated without the mutation.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage in the first sample (which caused lytic fission) had a mutation in rII that prevented it from integrating into the T_4 genome, then when it was plated on strain K, it couldn't integrate and wouldn't replicate, causing a plume. However, the phages on strain B's lawn that caused plumes were the non-integrating ones (lysogenic but allowed replication), so when they were plated on strain K, they couldn't integrate, causing a plume. But the count on strain K was 4, which matches the number of non-integrating lysogenic phages.\n\nWait, but the non-integrating lysogenic phages would cause a plume on strain B, but not on strain K. So on strain B's lawn, the 40 plumes include both the non-integrating lysogenic phages and the integrating lysogenic phages that lost the mutation. On strain K's lawn, only the non-integrating lysogenic phages cause plumes, which would be fewer than 40.\n\nHowever, the user says that when the phages are mixed, the result is 40 on B and 4 on K. So if the lysogenic phages in the first sample are only on strain B, then when mixed with non-lysogenic phages, the integration of lysogenic phages into strain K leads to plumes, but the integration into strain B leads to plumes due to the mutation. This is conflicting with the problem statement, which says that only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, implying that non-integrating lysogenic phages don't cause a plume.\n\nPerhaps the mistake is thinking that the lysogenic phages on strain B are only the ones that cause lytic fission. But in reality, the lysogenic phages themselves carry mutations, including rII, which might allow them to integrate into the T_4 genome. Therefore, when mixed, some of the lysogenic phages (with the mutation) might integrate without disrupting the T_4, allowing them to replicate and cause a plume on strain B. However, when these are plated on strain K, they don't integrate because they lack the mutation, so they don't cause a plume.\n\nThus, the number of recombined plumes (lysogenic phages that lost the mutation upon integration) would be zero, because they aren't recombining. Instead, the recombination would refer to the inability of the lysogenic phages to integrate into strain K. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain K would correspond to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation.\n\nGiven that the user reports 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, and assuming that the lysogenic phages on B are the ones that cause plumes, the difference suggests that 36 of them lost the mutation upon integration. If the mutation is rare, the expected number of recombinants (lost mutations) would be proportional to the fraction of the population.\n\nUsing the formula:\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinants / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the total offspring would be the sum of plumes on both strains, i.e., 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nIf 36 of these lost the mutation, then Recombination Frequency = (36/44)*100% \u2248 81.8%. But this doesn't make sense because the options provided are much lower (like 1%, etc.), so I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants corresponds directly to the number of plumes on K, which is 4. So if 4 phages lost the mutation, and the rest didn't, then the recombination frequency would be 4/(4+36) = 1/10=10%, which isn't an option either. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination implies that the mutation in rII is present in both strains, but in the experiment, only the lysogenic phage carries this mutation. Therefore, when mixed, the integration of lysogenic phages into strain K would lose the mutation, leading to no plume. Thus, the number of plumes on K should be equal to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation.\n\nGiven that on strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, which includes both the lysogenic phages that lost the mutation and those that didn't (integrated without the mutation). Similarly, on strain K, the number of plumes would be the lysogenic phages that lost the mutation, as they can't integrate anymore.\n\nSo if the number of plumes on K is 4, that implies that 4 phages lost the mutation. The number on B is 40, which includes both the unaffected lysogenic phages (let's say x) and the recombinant ones (y), so x + y = 40. The plumes on K are y = 4. Therefore, x = 36.\n\nSo the recombination frequency would be y/(x+y) *100% = 4/40*100%=10%.\n\nBut none of the answer choices match 10%. The closest is D.05%, which is 5%. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's double-check. If the recombination frequency is y/(x+y)*100%, and y=4, x+y=40, then 4/40=0.1, which is 10%. But the options don't have 10%, so perhaps I misinterpreted the data.\n\nAnother angle: The recombination frequency can also be expressed as (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individual copies). If the mutation is rare, the expected number of recombinants would be proportional to the square root of the product of frequencies in each parent generation, following Haldane's formula. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the fact that the number of recombinant plumes corresponds to the number of phages that lost the mutation. Given that on strain B, the number of plumes is 40, which includes the unaffected lysogenic phages plus the recombinant ones. On strain K, the number of plumes is 4, which is just the number of recombinant phages. Therefore, the number of recombinants is 4. The total number of phages in the first experiment is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. So the recombination frequency would be (4/44)*100%\u22489.09%, which rounds to approximately 9.1%, but again, none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombined plumes is 4 on K, corresponding to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation. Since the lysogenic phages in the first sample were on strain B, and when mixed with strain K, only 4 lost the mutation, leading to 4 plumes on K. Then, the number of such phages is 4, and the total number of phages in the first sample is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. Therefore, the recombination frequency is (4/44)*100%\u22489.09%, but this still doesn't align with the options given.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The data suggests that when the lysogenic phage (with the mutation in rII) is plated on strain K, it cannot integrate, causing a plume. However, when it's plated on strain B, it integrates without the mutation, leading to no plume. But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, implying that non-integrating lysogenic phages don't cause",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 plumes on K, that means four phages have successfully integrated into the E. coli strain K. Similarly, 40 plumes on B indicate 40 phages integrated into strain B.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Actually, when you plate a phage on a bacterial lawn, any new phages will cause a plume. So in this case, the E. coli is being used as the lawn for each treatment. So if you plate the phages on strain B, any successful integration would produce a plume. Similarly, if you plate them on strain K, any successful integration would produce a plume. So the number of plumes indicates how many phages have successfully integrated into each bacteria.\n\nBut wait, in this experiment, the phages are from different strains, so their integration might interfere. However, the problem states that both types of phages are present, so perhaps the recombination refers to how the two mutation types interact during phage lysis.\n\nThe key here is that only the lysogenic phage caused the lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage can integrate into the T_4 genome. If there was recombination, it would mean that the lysogenic phage has incorporated a mutation from the lysogenic phage, possibly into the T_4 DNA.\n\nIn experiments where multiple phages are present, the occurrence of successful integration in one strain can influence the success in another due to recombination. For example, if the lysogenic phage has incorporated a mutation from the phage that caused the lytic fission, then it might be less likely to integrate into strain B but more likely into strain K.\n\nLooking at the data: In the first plate, the phages are all lysogenic because only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission. So all the phages are lysogenic. They're plated on strain B's lawn, so any successful integration should lead to a plume on B. But the result showed 40 plumes on B. That seems high. Wait, no, actually, when you plate lysogenic phages on a strain, they either lyse the cell or replicate without causing a plume. Since these are lysogenic phages, they replicate and don't lyse, so they shouldn't cause a plume. Therefore, the presence of plumes on B must come from the phages that are not lysogenic but somehow integrated into the T_4 genome. But that contradicts the initial statement that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in the genomic region called rII.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII, which affects its ability to integrate into the T_4 genome. So when the lysogenic phage integrates, it may disrupt the T_4 genome, leading to a lytic fission instead of lysogenic. However, the phages carrying the lysogenic mutation may also have a mutation in rII that prevents them from integrating into the T_4 genome. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that allows it to integrate into the T_4 despite being lysogenic.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible outcomes. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, it may lose its ability to integrate into the T_4 genome. So when it integrates, it could become a lysogenic phage again, which would lyse the cell. But if it retains the mutation, it might still integrate but cause lytic fission. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage could have a mutation that stops it from integrating into the T_4 genome, meaning it doesn't replicate.\n\nBut according to the problem, the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, so it must replicate without losing the mutation in rII. Therefore, the lysogenic phage does integrate into the T_4 genome but doesn't disrupt it, allowing it to replicate. Now, if we mix two types of phages, some with and some without the mutation, the integration process might be influenced by recombination. Recombination would explain why some phages integrate without the mutation and others do when mixed.\n\nNow, looking at the data: The first plate (strains B) had 40 plumes. Assuming that all the phages in this plate are lysogenic (since only lysogenic cause lytic), but some of them might have the mutation in rII. If the mutation in rII leads to loss of integrase (the enzyme that allows phage integration), then the lysogenic phage would replicate without losing the mutation. Wait, but the lysogenic phage itself has the mutation in rII, which might affect its ability to integrate.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage integrates normally but has a mutation in rII that prevents it from replicating, then when mixed with another lysogenic phage that lacks this mutation, it won't replicate and thus won't cause a plume. But if they're mixed together, the integration process might be influenced by recombination.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the number of recombinant individuals would correspond to the number of phages that have successfully integrated into the T_4 genome but lost the mutation. The total offspring would be the sum of the successful integrations in each strain.\n\nBut in our case, all the phages in the first plate (on strain B) are lysogenic, so they should integrate without disrupting the T_4. However, some might have lost the mutation in rII, making them unable to integrate properly. These would replicate without causing a plume.\n\nWhen these are plated on strain K, any phages that cannot integrate would cause a plume. But the data shows that on strain K, only 40 plumes were observed, whereas on strain B, 40 plumes were seen. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, the first plate was on strain B, and the second on strain K. The counts were 40 on K and 40 on B? No, the user wrote \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nWait, no, the user says: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, meaning 40 phages successfully integrated into strain B. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found, meaning 4 phages successfully integrated into strain K.\n\nSince the phages in the first sample are all lysogenic (because only lysogenic cause lytic fission), they should integrate into the T_4 genome. However, some of them might have a mutation in rII that prevents them from replicating, meaning they wouldn't cause a plume even though they integrate.\n\nTherefore, on strain B's lawn, the 40 plumes correspond to phages that successfully integrated but did not replicate (due to the mutation in rII). On strain K's lawn, the 4 plumes correspond to phages that successfully replicated (no mutation in rII).\n\nNow, considering the experiment where both types of phages are present, the recombination frequency would determine how much of the lysogenic phage's mutation caused disruption. The number of recombined plumes would depend on how many phages lost the mutation upon mixing.\n\nIf the mutation in rII is rare, the chance that a lysogenic phage loses it upon mixing would be low. Therefore, the number of recombined plumes (those that lost the mutation) would be small relative to the total number of plumes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- R = number of recombined plumes (lost mutation)\n- S = number of intact plumes (didn\u2019t lose mutation)\n\nTotal plumes on B: R + S = 40\nPlumes on K: Only those that didn't lose the mutation would cause a plume, but wait, K's phages are not lysogenic because the original phages in the first sample were lysogenic. So all phages on K's lawn are non-lysogenic, meaning they don't cause plumes. Wait, no, the phages on K's lawn are non-lysogenic, so they don't cause plumes regardless of mutation. But the user said four plumes on K, which confuses me.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The initial phages are a mixture of lysogenic and non-lysogenic. The lysogenic ones cause lytic fission, while the non-lysogenic ones don't. So when plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause a plume. The non-lysogenic phages, if present, would not cause a plume, but in the experiment, the phages are mixed before plating, so the non-lysogenic ones remain undetectable.\n\nWait, but the user says that when the phages are mixed, the result was 40 on K and 4 on B. So perhaps the non-lysogenic phages remain undetectable, but the lysogenic ones cause plumes. So on strain B's lawn, only the lysogenic phages cause plumes, and on strain K's lawn, the same lysogenic phages don't cause plumes because they don't integrate.\n\nBut the user's description says that when the phages are plated on strain B, 40 plumes are found. This suggests that some of the phages integrated but lost the mutation, resulting in no replication. So when these are plated on strain K, which is a different T_4 genome, the integration occurs without the mutation, causing a plume. However, the data shows 4 plumes on K, which implies that 4 phages successfully integrated without the mutation. But if the lysogenic phages in the first sample already lost the mutation upon integration, then they shouldn't integrate again on strain K.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. The recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nIn this context, the number of recombinant individuals would be the number of phages that successfully integrated into the T_4 genome but lost the mutation in rII, leading to no replication. The total number of offspring would be the sum of all successful integrations on both strains.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- Strain B's lawn: 40 plumes \u2192 40 phages successfully integrated but lost the mutation.\n- Strain K's lawn: 4 plumes \u2192 4 phages successfully integrated without the mutation.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage in the first sample (which caused lytic fission) had a mutation in rII that prevented it from integrating into the T_4 genome, then when it was plated on strain K, it couldn't integrate and wouldn't replicate, causing a plume. However, the phages on strain B's lawn that caused plumes were the non-integrating ones (lysogenic but allowed replication), so when they were plated on strain K, they couldn't integrate, causing a plume. But the count on strain K was 4, which matches the number of non-integrating lysogenic phages.\n\nWait, but the non-integrating lysogenic phages would cause a plume on strain B, but not on strain K. So on strain B's lawn, the 40 plumes include both the non-integrating lysogenic phages and the integrating lysogenic phages that lost the mutation. On strain K's lawn, only the non-integrating lysogenic phages cause plumes, which would be fewer than 40.\n\nHowever, the user says that when the phages are mixed, the result is 40 on B and 4 on K. So if the lysogenic phages in the first sample are only on strain B, then when mixed with non-lysogenic phages, the integration of lysogenic phages into strain K leads to plumes, but the integration into strain B leads to plumes due to the mutation. This is conflicting with the problem statement, which says that only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, implying that non-integrating lysogenic phages don't cause a plume.\n\nPerhaps the mistake is thinking that the lysogenic phages on strain B are only the ones that cause lytic fission. But in reality, the lysogenic phages themselves carry mutations, including rII, which might allow them to integrate into the T_4 genome. Therefore, when mixed, some of the lysogenic phages (with the mutation) might integrate without disrupting the T_4, allowing them to replicate and cause a plume on strain B. However, when these are plated on strain K, they don't integrate because they lack the mutation, so they don't cause a plume.\n\nThus, the number of recombined plumes (lysogenic phages that lost the mutation upon integration) would be zero, because they aren't recombining. Instead, the recombination would refer to the inability of the lysogenic phages to integrate into strain K. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain K would correspond to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation.\n\nGiven that the user reports 40 plumes on B and 4 on K, and assuming that the lysogenic phages on B are the ones that cause plumes, the difference suggests that 36 of them lost the mutation upon integration. If the mutation is rare, the expected number of recombinants (lost mutations) would be proportional to the fraction of the population.\n\nUsing the formula:\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinants / Total number of offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nHere, the total offspring would be the sum of plumes on both strains, i.e., 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nIf 36 of these lost the mutation, then Recombination Frequency = (36/44)*100% \u2248 81.8%. But this doesn't make sense because the options provided are much lower (like 1%, etc.), so I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinants corresponds directly to the number of plumes on K, which is 4. So if 4 phages lost the mutation, and the rest didn't, then the recombination frequency would be 4/(4+36) = 1/10=10%, which isn't an option either. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination implies that the mutation in rII is present in both strains, but in the experiment, only the lysogenic phage carries this mutation. Therefore, when mixed, the integration of lysogenic phages into strain K would lose the mutation, leading to no plume. Thus, the number of plumes on K should be equal to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation.\n\nGiven that on strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, which includes both the lysogenic phages that lost the mutation and those that didn't (integrated without the mutation). Similarly, on strain K, the number of plumes would be the lysogenic phages that lost the mutation, as they can't integrate anymore.\n\nSo if the number of plumes on K is 4, that implies that 4 phages lost the mutation. The number on B is 40, which includes both the unaffected lysogenic phages (let's say x) and the recombinant ones (y), so x + y = 40. The plumes on K are y = 4. Therefore, x = 36.\n\nSo the recombination frequency would be y/(x+y) *100% = 4/40*100%=10%.\n\nBut none of the answer choices match 10%. The closest is D.05%, which is 5%. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's double-check. If the recombination frequency is y/(x+y)*100%, and y=4, x+y=40, then 4/40=0.1, which is 10%. But the options don't have 10%, so perhaps I misinterpreted the data.\n\nAnother angle: The recombination frequency can also be expressed as (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individual copies). If the mutation is rare, the expected number of recombinants would be proportional to the square root of the product of frequencies in each parent generation, following Haldane's formula. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the fact that the number of recombinant plumes corresponds to the number of phages that lost the mutation. Given that on strain B, the number of plumes is 40, which includes the unaffected lysogenic phages plus the recombinant ones. On strain K, the number of plumes is 4, which is just the number of recombinant phages. Therefore, the number of recombinants is 4. The total number of phages in the first experiment is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. So the recombination frequency would be (4/44)*100%\u22489.09%, which rounds to approximately 9.1%, but again, none of the options match exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of recombined plumes is 4 on K, corresponding to the number of lysogenic phages that lost the mutation. Since the lysogenic phages in the first sample were on strain B, and when mixed with strain K, only 4 lost the mutation, leading to 4 plumes on K. Then, the number of such phages is 4, and the total number of phages in the first sample is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. Therefore, the recombination frequency is (4/44)*100%\u22489.09%, but this still doesn't align with the options given.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. The data suggests that when the lysogenic phage (with the mutation in rII) is plated on strain K, it cannot integrate, causing a plume. However, when it's plated on strain B, it integrates without the mutation, leading to no plume. But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, implying that non-integrating lysogenic phages don't cause",

So when only one type is present, only one strain is affected. But when both are present, the effect depends on their interaction\u2014recombination would lead to more co-infected cells, leading to more plumes. Recombination means the two mutations interact, causing some cells to be susceptible to both types of phages, while others are only affected by one. \n\nThe formula for calculating the number of recombinants is generally related to the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If p is the frequency of one mutation and q is the frequency of the other, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on how often both mutations occur together. However, without knowing the exact frequencies, we might assume that the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility, thus reducing the number of independent infections.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when both mutants are present, the total number of phages that successfully infect the cells increases, but if they recombine, some cells may be susceptible to both, meaning fewer new infections per cell overall. This could lead to more cells being free from infection, hence fewer plumes. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutations leads to a higher chance of cross-infection, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nLet me think again. In pure lytic phage (only one mutation), all cells die, so no plumes. In pure lysogenic (only one mutation), the phages cause lysogeny, so some cells survive. When you mix the two, you get some cells that are lysogenic and also have the lytic mutation, which might allow them to survive better, thus more plumes. Or perhaps some cells become resistant to both phages due to recombination, allowing more phages to infect them.\n\nAlternatively, recombination could increase the probability that a cell is susceptible to both phages, thus potentially increasing the number of plumes because more phages can infect the same cells. Wait, no\u2014if a cell is susceptible to both, it might allow more phages to infect it, leading to more plumes. Or if recombination occurs, some cells might not be infected at all, leading to fewer plumes. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plumes observed should correspond to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Since each plume represents an infection, the total number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinant plumes would be pq, where p and q are the fractions of cells carrying each mutation. But since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, when mixed with the lytic, strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4. That suggests that the combination leads to more susceptibility than either individual, meaning that some cells are unaffected by both.\n\nWait, actually, when both mutants are present, the number of plumes decreases compared to when only one is present. Because the lytic phage kills the cells, but the lysogenic phage allows some cells to survive. If both are present, maybe some cells are resistant to both, meaning fewer infections. So the expectation would be lower when both are present.\n\nIn the experiment, when only lysogenic (assuming strain B is the one that becomes lyso despite having the lysogenic mutation?), wait no\u2014the problem says the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K. So when only lysogenic is present, strain B is affected. When both are present, some cells are affected more because the lysogenic phage is active, but maybe some are unaffected.\n\nWait, the initial statement says that the lytic phage (which only works when present alone) causes lyosis of strain B but not K. So when only one type is present, only one strain is affected. When both are present, strain B is partially affected because the lysogenic phage is active. So the total number of plumes on strain B is 40, which includes the 40 plumes from the lysogenic phage (since it's active enough to kill some cells) plus any that survive but don't lyse.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell; it just allows replication. So if the lysogenic phage is active, some cells will replicate without killing them, allowing the lytic phage (if present) to kill them. Therefore, the presence of lysogenic phages allows some cells to survive, but if both lysogenic and lytic are present, maybe some cells are resistant to both, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo when both are present, the total plumes should be less than when only one is present. In this case, when only lysogenic is present, all cells are susceptible except those killed by the lysogenic phage. Wait, no\u2014if only lysogenic is present, the phages cause some cells to lyse, so those cells are dead. The remaining cells are susceptible to lysogeny, so some will lyse as well? No, wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; it allows replication. So if only lysogenic is present, all cells are alive and susceptible to lysogeny, so all cells would lyse. Thus, when only lysogenic is present, all cells are affected, resulting in maximum plumes.\n\nWhen both lysogenic and lytic are present, some cells lyse (due to lysogeny), others may survive but don't lyse. The lytic phage kills the cells that replicate without lysogeny. So the cells that are lysogenic (from the lysogenic phage) will lyse, releasing phages that lyse other cells. Cells that are resistant to lysogeny but may replicate would remain, but if the lytic phage is present, they'd lyse regardless. Wait, no\u2014if only lysogenic is present, all cells replicate, so the lytic phage isn't needed. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to model it:\n\n- Lysogenic phage (L): causes lysogeny, allowing replication.\n- Lytic phage (Y): upon replication, lyses the cell and releases Y.\n- When only L is present:\n   - All cells replicate because L doesn't lyse.\n   - Y is present but doesn't lyse anything.\n   - So all cells are alive and susceptible to L.\n   - Resulting in maximum plumes.\n\n- When only Y is present:\n   - Y replicates within each cell, lysis occurs.\n   - So most cells die.\n   - Only cells resistant to replication without lysogeny (but that's rare) survive.\n   - Resulting in minimal plumes.\n\n- When both L and Y are present:\n   - Y replicates, lysis occurs, releasing Y which lyse the lysogenic cells.\n   - L cells lyse, releasing Y which lyse other cells.\n   - So some cells die, but others may be resistant to both L and Y, depending on their replication capacity.\n   - Resulting in a certain number of plumes.\n\nFrom the problem, when only L is present, strain B is affected, resulting in maximum plumes. When both L and Y are present, strain B is partially affected (40 plumes), but strain K is unaffected (4 plumes).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, when both types are present, strain B shows 40 plumes and strain K shows 4. So it seems like strain B is affected more, but why is strain K unaffected?\n\nHmm, maybe because the presence of both mutations in strain K leads to some resistance, whereas in strain B, even though both mutations are present, strain K remains unaffected. Or perhaps the combination leads to some cells being resistant to both, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the lytic phage that carries mutations in the genomic region rII can cause the lysis of strain B but not of strain K.\" So when only lytic is present (mutated), strain B dies, strain K survives. When both are present, strain B is affected (40 plumes) but strain K is not (4 plumes). So the presence of both mutations reduces the number of plumes on strain B, indicating some degree of interaction between the mutations.\n\nNow, to find the recombination rate. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes when both mutations are present is roughly the product of their frequencies. But since the experiment gives specific numbers, we can calculate it.\n\nAssuming that the presence of both mutations leads to some cells being resistant to both, thereby reducing the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain B to strain K can give us information about their frequencies.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that strain B has 10 times as many plumes as strain K, which implies that strain K has mutations that reduce the susceptibility, whereas strain B has mutations that enhance it. But given that the problem asks for the recombination rate, let's focus on that.\n\nRecombination rate is the percentage of cells that carry both mutations. If R is the recombination rate, then the frequency of cells carrying both mutations is R. Each such cell can contribute to more plumes because both mutations allow replication and lysis.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when both mutations are present is proportional to R. However, the actual number of plumes depends on the interaction between the mutations. Without recombination, each mutation would act independently, but with recombination, some cells are unaffected by both.\n\nGiven that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that strain B has mutations that enhance susceptibility, while strain K has mutations that reduce it. But the problem asks for recombination, so maybe the ratio relates to the frequency of recombination.\n\nIf the recombination rate is low, say 1%, then the number of cells carrying both mutations is small, leading to fewer plumes. But in our case, strain B has more plumes than strain K, suggesting that strain B has higher susceptibility, implying more recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the formula for the number of plumes when both mutations are present: plumes = (p + q - 2R), assuming R is the recombination fraction. But this might be oversimplified.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes on a strain can be modeled as N = n * sqrt(pq), where n is the number of cells, p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way: when both mutations are present, the number of plumes is less than when only one is present. The decrease can be attributed to recombination. If there's no recombination, the number of plumes would be maximal. With recombination, some cells are resistant, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that, the decrease from maximal plumes (say, 80) to 40 on strain B suggests a significant reduction. Similarly, strain K goes from 80 to 4. The difference between 40 and 4 is 36 plumes on strain B and 76 on strain K. But this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. So if the recombination rate is high, the number of plumes would be lower. Given the numbers, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. Assuming that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, then R = 1/10 \u2248 0.1% (option D). But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes when both mutations are present is equal to the sum of plumes from each mutation minus twice the recombination plumes. So plumes = P_L + P_Y - 2R. Here, P_L is the plumes from lysogenic phage, P_Y from lytic, and R is the recombination plumes.\n\nBut in our case, when both are present, the total plumes are 40 on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, the maximum plumes would be when only one mutation is present. For example, if only lysogenic is present, max plumes = 80 (assuming 80 cells), but when both are present, the number decreases.\n\nHowever, without precise data on the individual contributions, it's tricky. But given the options, 0.1% seems plausible for recombination rate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So 40 plumes on B mean 40 successful infections, and 4 on K mean 4 successful infections.\n\nBut wait, the initial description says that the lytic phage caused lyosis of strain B but not strain K. So when only one type is present, only one strain is affected. But when both are present, the effect depends on their interaction\u2014recombination would lead to more co-infected cells, leading to more plumes. Recombination means the two mutations interact, causing some cells to be susceptible to both types of phages, while others are only affected by one. \n\nThe formula for calculating the number of recombinants is generally related to the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If p is the frequency of one mutation and q is the frequency of the other, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on how often both mutations occur together. However, without knowing the exact frequencies, we might assume that the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility, thus reducing the number of independent infections.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when both mutants are present, the total number of phages that successfully infect the cells increases, but if they recombine, some cells may be susceptible to both, meaning fewer new infections per cell overall. This could lead to more cells being free from infection, hence fewer plumes. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutations leads to a higher chance of cross-infection, increasing the number of plumes.\n\nLet me think again. In pure lytic phage (only one mutation), all cells die, so no plumes. In pure lysogenic (only one mutation), the phages cause lysogeny, so some cells survive. When you mix the two, you get some cells that are lysogenic and also have the lytic mutation, which might allow them to survive better, thus more plumes. Or perhaps some cells become resistant to both phages due to recombination, allowing more phages to infect them.\n\nAlternatively, recombination could increase the probability that a cell is susceptible to both phages, thus potentially increasing the number of plumes because more phages can infect the same cells. Wait, no\u2014if a cell is susceptible to both, it might allow more phages to infect it, leading to more plumes. Or if recombination occurs, some cells might not be infected at all, leading to fewer plumes. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps another approach: the number of plumes observed should correspond to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Since each plume represents an infection, the total number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinant plumes would be pq, where p and q are the fractions of cells carrying each mutation. But since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, when mixed with the lytic, strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4. That suggests that the combination leads to more susceptibility than either individual, meaning that some cells are unaffected by both.\n\nWait, actually, when both mutants are present, the number of plumes decreases compared to when only one is present. Because the lytic phage kills the cells, but the lysogenic phage allows some cells to survive. If both are present, maybe some cells are resistant to both, meaning fewer infections. So the expectation would be lower when both are present.\n\nIn the experiment, when only lysogenic (assuming strain B is the one that becomes lyso despite having the lysogenic mutation?), wait no\u2014the problem says the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K. So when only lysogenic is present, strain B is affected. When both are present, some cells are affected more because the lysogenic phage is active, but maybe some are unaffected.\n\nWait, the initial statement says that the lytic phage (which only works when present alone) causes lyosis of strain B but not K. So when only one type is present, only one strain is affected. When both are present, strain B is partially affected because the lysogenic phage is active. So the total number of plumes on strain B is 40, which includes the 40 plumes from the lysogenic phage (since it's active enough to kill some cells) plus any that survive but don't lyse.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell; it just allows replication. So if the lysogenic phage is active, some cells will replicate without killing them, allowing the lytic phage (if present) to kill them. Therefore, the presence of lysogenic phages allows some cells to survive, but if both lysogenic and lytic are present, maybe some cells are resistant to both, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo when both are present, the total plumes should be less than when only one is present. In this case, when only lysogenic is present, all cells are susceptible except those killed by the lysogenic phage. Wait, no\u2014if only lysogenic is present, the phages cause some cells to lyse, so those cells are dead. The remaining cells are susceptible to lysogeny, so some will lyse as well? No, wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; it allows replication. So if only lysogenic is present, all cells are alive and susceptible to lysogeny, so all cells would lyse. Thus, when only lysogenic is present, all cells are affected, resulting in maximum plumes.\n\nWhen both lysogenic and lytic are present, some cells lyse (due to lysogeny), others may survive but don't lyse. The lytic phage kills the cells that replicate without lysogeny. So the cells that are lysogenic (from the lysogenic phage) will lyse, releasing phages that lyse other cells. Cells that are resistant to lysogeny but may replicate would remain, but if the lytic phage is present, they'd lyse regardless. Wait, no\u2014if only lysogenic is present, all cells replicate, so the lytic phage isn't needed. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to model it:\n\n- Lysogenic phage (L): causes lysogeny, allowing replication.\n- Lytic phage (Y): upon replication, lyses the cell and releases Y.\n- When only L is present:\n   - All cells replicate because L doesn't lyse.\n   - Y is present but doesn't lyse anything.\n   - So all cells are alive and susceptible to L.\n   - Resulting in maximum plumes.\n\n- When only Y is present:\n   - Y replicates within each cell, lysis occurs.\n   - So most cells die.\n   - Only cells resistant to replication without lysogeny (but that's rare) survive.\n   - Resulting in minimal plumes.\n\n- When both L and Y are present:\n   - Y replicates, lysis occurs, releasing Y which lyse the lysogenic cells.\n   - L cells lyse, releasing Y which lyse other cells.\n   - So some cells die, but others may be resistant to both L and Y, depending on their replication capacity.\n   - Resulting in a certain number of plumes.\n\nFrom the problem, when only L is present, strain B is affected, resulting in maximum plumes. When both L and Y are present, strain B is partially affected (40 plumes), but strain K is unaffected (4 plumes).\n\nWait, but according to the problem, when both types are present, strain B shows 40 plumes and strain K shows 4. So it seems like strain B is affected more, but why is strain K unaffected?\n\nHmm, maybe because the presence of both mutations in strain K leads to some resistance, whereas in strain B, even though both mutations are present, strain K remains unaffected. Or perhaps the combination leads to some cells being resistant to both, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the lytic phage that carries mutations in the genomic region rII can cause the lysis of strain B but not of strain K.\" So when only lytic is present (mutated), strain B dies, strain K survives. When both are present, strain B is affected (40 plumes) but strain K is not (4 plumes). So the presence of both mutations reduces the number of plumes on strain B, indicating some degree of interaction between the mutations.\n\nNow, to find the recombination rate. The formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes when both mutations are present is roughly the product of their frequencies. But since the experiment gives specific numbers, we can calculate it.\n\nAssuming that the presence of both mutations leads to some cells being resistant to both, thereby reducing the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain B to strain K can give us information about their frequencies.\n\nStrain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that strain B has 10 times as many plumes as strain K, which implies that strain K has mutations that reduce the susceptibility, whereas strain B has mutations that enhance it. But given that the problem asks for the recombination rate, let's focus on that.\n\nRecombination rate is the percentage of cells that carry both mutations. If R is the recombination rate, then the frequency of cells carrying both mutations is R. Each such cell can contribute to more plumes because both mutations allow replication and lysis.\n\nThe expected number of plumes when both mutations are present is proportional to R. However, the actual number of plumes depends on the interaction between the mutations. Without recombination, each mutation would act independently, but with recombination, some cells are unaffected by both.\n\nGiven that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that strain B has mutations that enhance susceptibility, while strain K has mutations that reduce it. But the problem asks for recombination, so maybe the ratio relates to the frequency of recombination.\n\nIf the recombination rate is low, say 1%, then the number of cells carrying both mutations is small, leading to fewer plumes. But in our case, strain B has more plumes than strain K, suggesting that strain B has higher susceptibility, implying more recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the formula for the number of plumes when both mutations are present: plumes = (p + q - 2R), assuming R is the recombination fraction. But this might be oversimplified.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes on a strain can be modeled as N = n * sqrt(pq), where n is the number of cells, p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way: when both mutations are present, the number of plumes is less than when only one is present. The decrease can be attributed to recombination. If there's no recombination, the number of plumes would be maximal. With recombination, some cells are resistant, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that, the decrease from maximal plumes (say, 80) to 40 on strain B suggests a significant reduction. Similarly, strain K goes from 80 to 4. The difference between 40 and 4 is 36 plumes on strain B and 76 on strain K. But this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. So if the recombination rate is high, the number of plumes would be lower. Given the numbers, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. Assuming that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, then R = 1/10 \u2248 0.1% (option D). But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes when both mutations are present is equal to the sum of plumes from each mutation minus twice the recombination plumes. So plumes = P_L + P_Y - 2R. Here, P_L is the plumes from lysogenic phage, P_Y from lytic, and R is the recombination plumes.\n\nBut in our case, when both are present, the total plumes are 40 on B and 4 on K. Without recombination, the maximum plumes would be when only one mutation is present. For example, if only lysogenic is present, max plumes = 80 (assuming 80 cells), but when both are present, the number decreases.\n\nHowever, without precise data on the individual contributions, it's tricky. But given the options, 0.1% seems plausible for recombination rate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " So if there are 4 on K and 40 on B, maybe that relates to how often the phages infect the bacteria. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations work together or independently. If they're independent, the probability that both mutations occur is the product of their individual probabilities. If they're linked, their occurrence might be dependent.\n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. Diluting 1:10^7 means that fewer bacteria are exposed to each phage. Similarly, 1:10^5 is less dilution. The number of plumes depends on the frequency of successful infections. For a mutation to cause a failure, say in the lysogenic phage, you'd get more plumes because it's less likely to succeed compared to the non-lysogenic one. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of their success probabilities.\n\nBut wait, in this case, all the lysogenic phages failed, while the non-lysogenic ones worked fine. That suggests that the lysogenic phage has a high mutation rate causing failure, but the non-lysogenic one doesn't. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning the lysogenic phage didn't fail as much. This could indicate that the two mutations are interacting or recombining, perhaps making the lysogenic phage's function dependent on another factor, like the presence of the non-lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, no, if they're independent, then the expectation should be lower for both failing. Since strain B shows almost all failures (40 vs. none from the non-lysed), perhaps the independent assumption isn't correct. Alternatively, if they're linked, the frequency would reflect a certain level of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in the absence of any mutation, all phages would work fine. With only the lysogenic phage, it fails, leading to higher plumes. With the non-lysogenic, it works, so plumes are low. When both are present, the combination leads to some interference. Maybe the recombination refers to the likelihood that a bacterium has either mutation, thereby affecting its susceptibility.\n\nIn the first condition, when only lysogenic is present, most of the phages die. In the second condition, when both are present, some of the lysogenic phages don't die as easily because they have interacted with the non-lysogenic ones. This suggests that the two mutations are working together, possibly through recombination, making the lysogenic phage less effective than expected.\n\nSo the idea is that without recombination, the lysogenic phage's effectiveness would depend solely on its mutation rate. However, with recombination, there's an additional factor\u2014like a second mutation\u2014that affects its activity. The number of plumes indicates the combined effect of both mutations.\n\nGiven that, we can model the expected number of plumes under independence and see how close it is to what was observed. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be based on the product of their frequencies. Let's denote p as the fraction of the population carrying the mutation that causes failure. Then, the expected number of plumes would be N * (1 - p)^2, where N is the total number of phages. But in reality, the lysogenic phage failed completely, meaning that (1 - p)^2 = 0, implying p=1. But that contradicts the data because strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage didn't fail entirely. Therefore, the mutations must be interacting, indicating recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\np = 1 - sqrt(fraction_of_failure)\n\nIf all lysogenic phages failed, the fraction would be 1, so p = 0% recombination. But in this case, the fraction isn't zero; it's very low (40/100 = 0.4). So,\n\np = 1 - sqrt(0.4)\np \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 \u2192 ~36.75% recombination.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 1.5%, which is too low. D is 0.1%, too low. J is 0.05%, too low. F is 0.3%. Wait, my calculation gave ~36.75%, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me rethink. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are independent would be (1 - p1)(1 - p2). If both have the same p, then (1 - p)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 1 - p = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 p \u2248 0.3675. So about 36.75% recombination. But the options don't include that. The closest is F: 0.3%, which is around 30%, still off. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual scenario is that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness is reduced due to the presence of the non-lysogenic phage, indicating some degree of recombination. The observed number of plumes on strain B is 40, which is 40 out of 100, so 40%. Comparing to the expected under independence (which would be (1 - p)^2 = 0.4, so p\u22480.6325), the observed failure rate is 40%, which is quite high. Therefore, the recombination must be high enough to reduce the failure rate significantly.\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n(1 - p)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 p\u22480.6325 \u2192 ~63.25% recombination. But this is way beyond the options provided. None of the choices are near 63%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The question states that \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Saturated means that the bacteria have been killed, so no new phage can infect. So, when the culture is split, half are susceptible, half are resistant. Then, half is treated with a 1:10^7 dilution, and the other half is treated with 1:10^5.\n\nAfter treatment, on strain B, 4 plumes appear. On strain K, 40. Wait, that seems contradictory because if strain B is mostly affected, it shouldn't show many plumes. Unless... Perhaps I got it reversed. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the dilutions are applied before plating. So, if the culture is split, half is treated with 1:10^7, and the other half with 1:10^5. Then, each half is plated on the respective strain's lawn.\n\nStrain B is primarily affected, showing 40 plumes, and Strain K shows 4. That seems counterintuitive because Strain B is more affected, so why would it have fewer plumes? Unless the recombination makes Strain B's lawn less sensitive, but that doesn't make sense because Strain B is already mostly affected.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the treatment wrong. If the non-lysed sample (treated with 1:10^7) is being tested against Strain K, and the lysed sample (treated with 1:10^5) is tested against Strain B. But that would mean that the lysed samples are more susceptible, and the non-lysed are more resistant. However, in the experiment, Strain B is mostly affected, and Strain K is unaffected. That doesn't align unless the recombination reduces the susceptibility.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. The key is determining the recombination rate between the two mutations. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = 1 - e^{-2q}\n\nWhere q is the allele frequency. But in our case, we have two alleles, each with a certain frequency. Alternatively, using the formula for linked genes:\n\nP = p1 * p2\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation. But in this case, we're looking for the percentage recombination, which is approximately equal to P.\n\nHowever, in the context of phage mutations, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRF = [ (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring) ] * 100%\n\nBut in our case, since it's two independent mutations, the RF would be 1 - sqrt(fraction of failed phages).\n\nBut earlier calculations showed RF \u2248 63.25%, which isn't among the options. The closest option is G: 0.5%, which is too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. If both mutations are present, and they interfere with each other, the overall susceptibility might decrease. The number of plumes indicates the combined effect. If the non-lysed sample (1:10^7) is used against Strain B, and the ly sed (1:10^5) against Strain K, the result is that Strain B has more plumes (40) and Strain K has fewer (4). This suggests that the non-lysed sample is more susceptible to the lysogenic phage, which shouldn't happen because Strain B is already mostly affected.\n\nWait, maybe I've mixed up the groups. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the non-lysed sample (1:10^7) is plated on Strain K's lawn, it shows 4 plumes. When the lyved sample (1:10^5) is plated on Strain B's lawn, it shows 40 plumes. So, Strain B is mainly affected, but Strain K is unaffected. This suggests that the non-lysed sample (more susceptible) is testing against Strain K, which is unaffected, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, the lyved sample (less susceptible) is testing against Strain B, which is mostly affected, leading to more plumes.\n\nThis implies that the non-lysed sample is more susceptible to the lysogenic phage, but when tested against Strain K, which is more resistant, the lysogenic phage doesn't lead to many plumes. On the other hand, when tested against Strain B, which is mostly affected, the lysogenic phage leads to more plumes.\n\nThis suggests that the non-lysed sample (higher susceptibility) interacts with the lysogenic phage in such a way that the interaction increases the number of plumes when tested against Strain K, but decreases it when tested against Strain B.\n\nHmm, perhaps this indicates that the two mutations are interacting, reducing the susceptibility of the non-lysed sample when tested against Strain K but increasing susceptibility when tested against Strain B. This is unusual because typically, the order matters, but here it seems the opposite happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is occurring such that the lysogenic phage's function is influenced by the presence of the non-lyged sample, leading to increased activity when tested against Strain K but decreased activity when tested against Strain B.\n\nIn any case, going back to calculating the recombination percentage. Using the formula:\n\np = 1 - sqrt(fraction of failure)\n\nFraction of failure is 40/100 = 0.4\n\nsqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325\n\np \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\n\nNone of the answer choices match this, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes reflects the combined effect of both mutations. If the non-lyged sample (1:10^7) is being tested against Strain K, which is unaffected, it results in fewer plumes, suggesting that the non-lyged sample is less susceptible. Conversely, when tested against Strain B, it's more susceptible, resulting in more plumes.\n\nThis could imply that the non-lyged sample is partially susceptible, but the exact mechanism requires considering the recombination. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's challenging. Given the options, the closest is F: 0.3%, which is approximately 30%, somewhat close to 36.75%, but not exactly matching. It's possible that the intended answer is F, assuming a miscalculation or rounding down.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes on Strain B (40) versus Strain K (4) suggests that the non-lyged sample (test against Strain K) shows lower susceptibility, and the lyved sample (test against Strain B) shows higher susceptibility. This could be due to the presence of the non-lyged sample acting as a suppressor or enhancer of the lysogenic phage's activity, depending on the recombination pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is 0.1%, which is option J. But 0.1% seems too low given the failure rates involved. Alternatively, maybe the recombination is 0.05%, option F.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected failure rate if the two mutations are independent. If the expected number of plumes is N*(1-p)^2, where N is the total number of phages. If the fraction of failure is 40/N, then solving for p gives us p = 1 - sqrt(failure_fraction). As I did earlier, which led to ~36.75% recombination. Again, no option matches this. The next best is F: 0.3%, which is roughly 30%, slightly lower than 36.75%. Maybe the intended answer is F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is calculated as (failure_fraction)/(1 - failure_fraction). But that wouldn't directly give the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when the two mutations interfere, the combined effect is less severe than expected. The number of plumes indicates the degree of interference. If the non-lyged sample (1:10^7) is tested against Strain K, which is unaffected, and shows fewer plumes, it suggests that the non-lyged sample is more susceptible, meaning the presence of the non-lyged sample enhances the lysogenic phage's activity. Conversely, when tested against Strain B, which is mostly affected, the non-lyged sample reduces susceptibility, leading to more plumes.\n\nThis indicates that the two mutations are interacting, perhaps via recombination, where the presence of one mutation suppresses the effect of the other. The degree of suppression can be quantified by the fraction of plumes, which in this case is 40 instead of the expected 1 - p^2. Solving for p gives us ~36.75%, which is not an option, so perhaps the intended answer is F: 0.3%, assuming a simplified approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: 5%, which is closer to 36.75% than F. But I'm not confident. Without further information, I'll go with F: 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 4 on K and 40 on B, maybe that relates to how often the phages infect the bacteria. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations work together or independently. If they're independent, the probability that both mutations occur is the product of their individual probabilities. If they're linked, their occurrence might be dependent.\n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. Diluting 1:10^7 means that fewer bacteria are exposed to each phage. Similarly, 1:10^5 is less dilution. The number of plumes depends on the frequency of successful infections. For a mutation to cause a failure, say in the lysogenic phage, you'd get more plumes because it's less likely to succeed compared to the non-lysogenic one. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of their success probabilities.\n\nBut wait, in this case, all the lysogenic phages failed, while the non-lysogenic ones worked fine. That suggests that the lysogenic phage has a high mutation rate causing failure, but the non-lysogenic one doesn't. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning the lysogenic phage didn't fail as much. This could indicate that the two mutations are interacting or recombining, perhaps making the lysogenic phage's function dependent on another factor, like the presence of the non-lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, no, if they're independent, then the expectation should be lower for both failing. Since strain B shows almost all failures (40 vs. none from the non-lysed), perhaps the independent assumption isn't correct. Alternatively, if they're linked, the frequency would reflect a certain level of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in the absence of any mutation, all phages would work fine. With only the lysogenic phage, it fails, leading to higher plumes. With the non-lysogenic, it works, so plumes are low. When both are present, the combination leads to some interference. Maybe the recombination refers to the likelihood that a bacterium has either mutation, thereby affecting its susceptibility.\n\nIn the first condition, when only lysogenic is present, most of the phages die. In the second condition, when both are present, some of the lysogenic phages don't die as easily because they have interacted with the non-lysogenic ones. This suggests that the two mutations are working together, possibly through recombination, making the lysogenic phage less effective than expected.\n\nSo the idea is that without recombination, the lysogenic phage's effectiveness would depend solely on its mutation rate. However, with recombination, there's an additional factor\u2014like a second mutation\u2014that affects its activity. The number of plumes indicates the combined effect of both mutations.\n\nGiven that, we can model the expected number of plumes under independence and see how close it is to what was observed. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be based on the product of their frequencies. Let's denote p as the fraction of the population carrying the mutation that causes failure. Then, the expected number of plumes would be N * (1 - p)^2, where N is the total number of phages. But in reality, the lysogenic phage failed completely, meaning that (1 - p)^2 = 0, implying p=1. But that contradicts the data because strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage didn't fail entirely. Therefore, the mutations must be interacting, indicating recombination.\n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\np = 1 - sqrt(fraction_of_failure)\n\nIf all lysogenic phages failed, the fraction would be 1, so p = 0% recombination. But in this case, the fraction isn't zero; it's very low (40/100 = 0.4). So,\n\np = 1 - sqrt(0.4)\np \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 \u2192 ~36.75% recombination.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 1.5%, which is too low. D is 0.1%, too low. J is 0.05%, too low. F is 0.3%. Wait, my calculation gave ~36.75%, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me rethink. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are independent would be (1 - p1)(1 - p2). If both have the same p, then (1 - p)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 1 - p = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 p \u2248 0.3675. So about 36.75% recombination. But the options don't include that. The closest is F: 0.3%, which is around 30%, still off. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual scenario is that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness is reduced due to the presence of the non-lysogenic phage, indicating some degree of recombination. The observed number of plumes on strain B is 40, which is 40 out of 100, so 40%. Comparing to the expected under independence (which would be (1 - p)^2 = 0.4, so p\u22480.6325), the observed failure rate is 40%, which is quite high. Therefore, the recombination must be high enough to reduce the failure rate significantly.\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n(1 - p)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 p\u22480.6325 \u2192 ~63.25% recombination. But this is way beyond the options provided. None of the choices are near 63%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The question states that \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Saturated means that the bacteria have been killed, so no new phage can infect. So, when the culture is split, half are susceptible, half are resistant. Then, half is treated with a 1:10^7 dilution, and the other half is treated with 1:10^5.\n\nAfter treatment, on strain B, 4 plumes appear. On strain K, 40. Wait, that seems contradictory because if strain B is mostly affected, it shouldn't show many plumes. Unless... Perhaps I got it reversed. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the dilutions are applied before plating. So, if the culture is split, half is treated with 1:10^7, and the other half with 1:10^5. Then, each half is plated on the respective strain's lawn.\n\nStrain B is primarily affected, showing 40 plumes, and Strain K shows 4. That seems counterintuitive because Strain B is more affected, so why would it have fewer plumes? Unless the recombination makes Strain B's lawn less sensitive, but that doesn't make sense because Strain B is already mostly affected.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the treatment wrong. If the non-lysed sample (treated with 1:10^7) is being tested against Strain K, and the lysed sample (treated with 1:10^5) is tested against Strain B. But that would mean that the lysed samples are more susceptible, and the non-lysed are more resistant. However, in the experiment, Strain B is mostly affected, and Strain K is unaffected. That doesn't align unless the recombination reduces the susceptibility.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. The key is determining the recombination rate between the two mutations. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = 1 - e^{-2q}\n\nWhere q is the allele frequency. But in our case, we have two alleles, each with a certain frequency. Alternatively, using the formula for linked genes:\n\nP = p1 * p2\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation. But in this case, we're looking for the percentage recombination, which is approximately equal to P.\n\nHowever, in the context of phage mutations, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRF = [ (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring) ] * 100%\n\nBut in our case, since it's two independent mutations, the RF would be 1 - sqrt(fraction of failed phages).\n\nBut earlier calculations showed RF \u2248 63.25%, which isn't among the options. The closest option is G: 0.5%, which is too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. If both mutations are present, and they interfere with each other, the overall susceptibility might decrease. The number of plumes indicates the combined effect. If the non-lysed sample (1:10^7) is used against Strain B, and the ly sed (1:10^5) against Strain K, the result is that Strain B has more plumes (40) and Strain K has fewer (4). This suggests that the non-lysed sample is more susceptible to the lysogenic phage, which shouldn't happen because Strain B is already mostly affected.\n\nWait, maybe I've mixed up the groups. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen the non-lysed sample (1:10^7) is plated on Strain K's lawn, it shows 4 plumes. When the lyved sample (1:10^5) is plated on Strain B's lawn, it shows 40 plumes. So, Strain B is mainly affected, but Strain K is unaffected. This suggests that the non-lysed sample (more susceptible) is testing against Strain K, which is unaffected, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, the lyved sample (less susceptible) is testing against Strain B, which is mostly affected, leading to more plumes.\n\nThis implies that the non-lysed sample is more susceptible to the lysogenic phage, but when tested against Strain K, which is more resistant, the lysogenic phage doesn't lead to many plumes. On the other hand, when tested against Strain B, which is mostly affected, the lysogenic phage leads to more plumes.\n\nThis suggests that the non-lysed sample (higher susceptibility) interacts with the lysogenic phage in such a way that the interaction increases the number of plumes when tested against Strain K, but decreases it when tested against Strain B.\n\nHmm, perhaps this indicates that the two mutations are interacting, reducing the susceptibility of the non-lysed sample when tested against Strain K but increasing susceptibility when tested against Strain B. This is unusual because typically, the order matters, but here it seems the opposite happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is occurring such that the lysogenic phage's function is influenced by the presence of the non-lyged sample, leading to increased activity when tested against Strain K but decreased activity when tested against Strain B.\n\nIn any case, going back to calculating the recombination percentage. Using the formula:\n\np = 1 - sqrt(fraction of failure)\n\nFraction of failure is 40/100 = 0.4\n\nsqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325\n\np \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\n\nNone of the answer choices match this, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes reflects the combined effect of both mutations. If the non-lyged sample (1:10^7) is being tested against Strain K, which is unaffected, it results in fewer plumes, suggesting that the non-lyged sample is less susceptible. Conversely, when tested against Strain B, it's more susceptible, resulting in more plumes.\n\nThis could imply that the non-lyged sample is partially susceptible, but the exact mechanism requires considering the recombination. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's challenging. Given the options, the closest is F: 0.3%, which is approximately 30%, somewhat close to 36.75%, but not exactly matching. It's possible that the intended answer is F, assuming a miscalculation or rounding down.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes on Strain B (40) versus Strain K (4) suggests that the non-lyged sample (test against Strain K) shows lower susceptibility, and the lyved sample (test against Strain B) shows higher susceptibility. This could be due to the presence of the non-lyged sample acting as a suppressor or enhancer of the lysogenic phage's activity, depending on the recombination pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is 0.1%, which is option J. But 0.1% seems too low given the failure rates involved. Alternatively, maybe the recombination is 0.05%, option F.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected failure rate if the two mutations are independent. If the expected number of plumes is N*(1-p)^2, where N is the total number of phages. If the fraction of failure is 40/N, then solving for p gives us p = 1 - sqrt(failure_fraction). As I did earlier, which led to ~36.75% recombination. Again, no option matches this. The next best is F: 0.3%, which is roughly 30%, slightly lower than 36.75%. Maybe the intended answer is F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination is calculated as (failure_fraction)/(1 - failure_fraction). But that wouldn't directly give the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when the two mutations interfere, the combined effect is less severe than expected. The number of plumes indicates the degree of interference. If the non-lyged sample (1:10^7) is tested against Strain K, which is unaffected, and shows fewer plumes, it suggests that the non-lyged sample is more susceptible, meaning the presence of the non-lyged sample enhances the lysogenic phage's activity. Conversely, when tested against Strain B, which is mostly affected, the non-lyged sample reduces susceptibility, leading to more plumes.\n\nThis indicates that the two mutations are interacting, perhaps via recombination, where the presence of one mutation suppresses the effect of the other. The degree of suppression can be quantified by the fraction of plumes, which in this case is 40 instead of the expected 1 - p^2. Solving for p gives us ~36.75%, which is not an option, so perhaps the intended answer is F: 0.3%, assuming a simplified approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: 5%, which is closer to 36.75% than F. But I'm not confident. Without further information, I'll go with F: 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But here, both types are present in different dilutions. On strain B's lawn, only the lysogenic phage did something, while on strain K's lawn, the lysogenic phage didn't do anything.

Then they split the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning that each cell has 10^7 more phages.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages affects the outcome. If the lysogenic phage from strain B is more likely to infect, then when you plate on strain K, which expects only lysogenic phages, you see less infection because the lysogenic phage from B is interfering. So in the first case, dilution 1:10^7 means each cell has 10^7 phages, so the probability of a phage being lysogenic is higher. When you plate on strain B's lawn, all phages should be lysogenic, but due to high concentration, there's a low chance of infection, hence more plumes. When you plate on strain K's lawn, you expect only lysogenic phages, but the presence of the lysogenic phage from B could reduce the total number of successful infections, resulting in fewer plumes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dilutions affect the likelihood of infection. Dilution 1:10^7 makes the concentration very high, so the chance of a phage being lysogenic is higher, leading to more successful infections. When plated on strain B, which requires all phages to be lysogenic for replication without lytic events, the high concentration reduces the number of successful infections, leading to more plumes. Plated on strain K, which expects only lysogenic phages, but the presence of a high concentration of lysogenic phages from B might lead to interference, thus fewer plumes.\n\nNow, the key point is determining the recombination rate between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occur independently or are linked. If they are linked, their occurrence increases; if independent, their probabilities multiply.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes would involve the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, in this case, we're dealing with probabilities of infection. Let's denote p as the frequency of the lysogenic mutation in the T_4 phage, and q as the frequency in another mutation. The expected number of plumes would depend on the overlap of these frequencies.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phage is plated on strain B's lawn, only lysogenic phages are expected to replicate. But because the phage from strain B is more numerous (due to the high dilution), the chance of any phage being lysogenic is higher, so the number of successful infections is lower, leading to more plumes. Conversely, when plated on strain K's lawn, which expects only lysogenic phages, the presence of the lysogenic phage from B might reduce the total number of successful infections, hence fewer plumes.\n\nLet's calculate the expected number of plumes based on the probabilities. Suppose the frequency of lysogenic phage in strain B is p, and in strain K is q. Since strain B is only affected when lysogenic phages are present, the difference in plume counts reflects the effect of recombination.\n\nWhen plated on strain B's lawn:\n- Expected plumes = (p)^2 * (total phages)\nBecause both mutations must occur for the phage to successfully infect and replicate without lytic fission.\n\nWhen plated on strain K's lawn:\n- Expected plumes = (q)^2 * (total phages) - (cross term) * (p*q)*(total phages)\n\nBut in the experiment, the plumes on strain B's lawn were much higher than those on strain K's.

    "rollout": " So if you have multiple infections, you get more plumes.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If the phages cause lytic fission, they would lyse the bacterial cells, leading to lysogeny. Lysogenic phages do not lyse the bacteria and replicate within them, maintaining their genetic information. So in this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B might be causing issues when it infects strain B again, leading to recombination with the existing mutation in the T_4 phage.\n\nWhen both types of phages are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage could cause the T_4 phage to lose its wild-type sequence and gain the lysogenic sequence, leading to recombination. This would reduce the number of susceptible strains because the phage would now have a different genetic makeup, making them less likely to lyse the bacteria.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, the E. coli strain B shows a high percentage of infections, meaning the lysogenic phage is more effective at causing issues. However, when only the lysogenic phage is used, the infection rate is lower, indicating that it doesn't interact well with the existing T_4 mutation. \n\nThe dilutions suggest that the effect of the phage is being diluted as the culture is plated. The ratio (1:10^n) indicates how much of the phage has been transferred to the bacteria. A higher n means a smaller concentration of phage, so the effect is diluted more.\n\nSo, the key here is to determine the recombination frequency or the probability that the lysogenic phage's mutation causes a change in the T_4 phage's sequence. Since the lysogenic phage affects the strain B but not K, it must be interacting with the T_4 mutation in strain B. \n\nThe number of plumes observed depends on the likelihood of recombination. Each time a phage infects a bacterium, it creates a new plume. If the phage's mutation leads to a loss of function, it will lyse the bacteria, increasing the chance of lysogeny and possibly recombining with the host's mutation.\n\nIf the recombination happened, then when the lysogenic phage infects strain B, it might cause recombination with the existing T_4 mutation, reducing the susceptibility. Conversely, when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, there's no T_4 mutation, so the lysogenic phage would just cause lysogeny without recombination.\n\nLooking at the data: when both types are present, half the culture was plated on strain B (resulting in 40 plumes), and half on strain K (with 4 plumes). That suggests that the effect of the phage type on the outcome depends on the host strain. Strain B seems to be more responsive to the lysogenic phage than strain K. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations, not the effect on individual strains. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages due to interaction. In this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B (which carries a mutation in the T_4 genome) interacts with the T_4 phage in strain B, causing a loss of function and possible recombination. \n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - F1)(1 - F2)\n\nWhere F1 and F2 are the frequencies of the two alleles. Alternatively, if we know the expected number of recombinant offspring, we can use that to find the frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution ratios: the first half is plated on strain B at 1:10^7, and the second half on strain K at 1:10^5. The number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4.\n\nSince both types of phages are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B suggests that it caused some recombination. The ratio of plumes on strain B (40) compared to strain K (4) suggests that the lysogenic phage had a greater effect on strain B, implying that recombination occurred with a higher probability in strain B.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes based on the probabilities of recombination. For example, if the recombination frequency is R, then when both types are present, the number of plumes should reflect that.\n\nHowever, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently. The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B leads to more infections, while in strain K, it doesn't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage can infect strain B but not K, implying that it causes recombination in strain B but not in K. Therefore, the recombination occurs in strain B but not in K.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can consider the number of times the lysogenic phage in strain B caused recombination with the T_4 mutation in B. Since the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing recombination, the number of plumes should correlate with the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that recombination happens in proportion to the product of the frequencies of the two alleles involved. But without knowing the exact allele frequencies, it's tricky. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated based on the observed plume distribution.\n\nGiven that when both phages are present, half the bacteria are plated on strain B (40 plumes) and half on strain K (4 plumes). The presence of recombination in strain B suggests that the lysogenic phage caused recombination, whereas in strain K, it didn't.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is related to the difference in plume counts between the two groups. If recombination occurred in strain B but not in K, the frequency would depend on how often the lysogenic phage caused recombination.\n\nAnother approach: The number of plumes (infections) is proportional to the probability of recombination. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of plumes would be proportional to R.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to look for the ratio of plumes. Since the strain B group had more plumes (40 vs 4), the recombination frequency is higher in B than in K. To estimate R, we can assume that the number of plumes reflects the recombination rate. So if R is the recombination fraction, then the expected number of plumes in the strain B group would be higher.\n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the recombination fraction. Then, the expected number of plumes in the strain B group would be proportional to R * total plumes. Similarly, in the strain K group, it would be proportional to (R + something else), depending on whether there was any other effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency can be determined by the ratio of plumes in the two groups. The strain B group had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. Assuming that the recombination frequency is R, then the expectation would be that the strain B group had R times more plumes than the strain K group. So 40 / 4 = 10 = R. But that can\u2019t be right because R is usually less than 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. If the recombination frequency is R, then the strain B group would have R times more plumes than the strain K group. So 40 / 4 = 10 = R. But R can't exceed 1. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency might be such that when both phages are present, the strain B has a higher incidence of recombination. Perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated based on the ratio of plumes in the two groups. So, if strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 10:1, suggesting that recombination occurred 10 times more frequently in strain B than in strain K. But again, R is typically less than 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle. The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B increases the number of plumes, indicating that the mutation caused by recombination is occurring. The fact that it doesn't affect strain K suggests that recombination did not occur there. Therefore, the recombination frequency in strain B is higher than in K.\n\nBut without specific allele frequencies, it's hard to compute R directly. However, the problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, given the experimental results. It might relate to the expected number of plumes based on recombination.\n\nIf recombination happens, each time the lysogenic phage infects a bacterium, it may cause recombination with the T_4 mutation. The probability of recombination per infection would depend on the interaction between the two phages.\n\nBut perhaps the recombination frequency can be inferred from the ratio of plumes. If strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, and assuming that recombination happened in strain B, then the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination frequency multiplied by the total number of infections.\n\nBut without knowing the number of infections, it's still challenging. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be approximated by the ratio of plumes, adjusted for dilution factors.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes is influenced by the dilution factor. When the phage is plated at a certain dilution, the probability of infection decreases, thus affecting the number of plumes. If the lysogenic phage causes recombination, the number of plumes should increase when the phage is more concentrated (higher dilution).\n\nIn this case, the first half is plated at 1:10^7, and the second half at 1:10^5. The strain B group is more affected, so the number of plumes is higher there. This suggests that recombination occurred in strain B, as the lysogenic phage caused more plumes there.\n\nNow, to find the recombination frequency, perhaps we can model it as follows: Let R be the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plumes in strain B would be proportional to R, and in strain K, it would be proportional to (R + something else). However, without knowing the baseline, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated based on the difference in plume numbers between the two groups. The strain B group had 40 plumes, and the strain K group had 4. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that recombination occurred 10 times more often in strain B than in strain K. But this might not directly translate to R.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to recall that when two mutations interfere (like recombination), the combined effect is additive. So if the recombination frequency is R, then the probability of recombination is R, and the probability of neither mutation is (1-R)^2. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes when both phages are present would be the sum of the plumes from each scenario: recombination, no recombination, etc. But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options provided, the answer is likely to be a small percentage, reflecting the low recombination frequency. Among the options, H is 5%, J is 0.05%, etc., but since the options are letters representing percentages, I need to choose between the given options.\n\nConsidering that the lysogenic phage in strain B causes recombination, and the effect is strong (more plumes), the recombination frequency is probably low. Looking at the options, G is 0.5% and D is 0.1%. Given the data, the recombination is happening, so it's probably a small fraction.\n\nBetween G and D, G is 0.5% and D is 0.1%. Since the effect is stronger in strain B, the recombination might be higher, closer to 0.5%. Alternatively, if the effect is moderate, it might be around 1%.\n\nWait, but the data shows that the lysogenic phage in strain B causes more recombination than in strain K, where there's no T_4 mutation. So the recombination is occurring, but the frequency is low because it's not very widespread.\n\nGiven the options, G is 0.5%, which seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",

    "rollout": " So if there are 40 plumes on strain B's lawn, that means 40 phages have infected B cells. Similarly, 4 on strain K. \n\nHmm, I think this relates to double mutation events where both mutations occur in the same phage. If recombination occurred, then more double mutants would form. Normally, without recombination, you'd expect fewer double mutants because each phage has its own set of mutations. But here, with recombination, perhaps more double mutants occur than expected under standard Mendelian inheritance. Let me recall how such experiments typically analyze recombination rates.\n\nIn genetic crosses involving recombinant offspring, we calculate the percentage of observed recombinant phenotypes compared to the total possible non-duplicated cases. In this scenario, the presence of 40 plumes on strain B suggests significant recombination because the number is much higher than expected for independent assortment. If there was no recombination, the number of double mutants should be low. Here, 40 out of 40 + 4 = 44? Wait, maybe not exactly that. Alternatively, let's consider the typical approach used in such experiments.\n\nTypically, if there's complete recombination, all double mutants would show up as either double mutant or non-recombinant cases. Without recombination, you'd see only non-mutant and non-recombinant cases. But in reality, sometimes the counts aren't perfect due to various factors like selection or other interactions. However, assuming that the data given reflects the correct calculation, I need to relate the observed plumes to the expected recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: when two mutations interfere (recombine), each mutation can cause issues independently. So the probability of a double mutant would depend on whether the mutations are independent or linked. If they're linked, their occurrence is dependent, so the probability changes. But in this case, the experiment shows that when both types are present, the effect is similar to having only one type, suggesting some recombination but not complete linkage.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the wild-type phage carries two mutations, say A and B, while the mutant carries mutation C. Wait, no, actually, in phages, the wild-type usually has two dominant mutations, A and B, which, when combined, cause lysis. The mutant phage has one dominant mutation, say C, which prevents lysis but allows replication. Now, if the mutant also has another mutation D, then combining C and D could lead to double mutants, whereas the wild-type would have a chance of being lysed or not depending on whether both A and B are present.\n\nBut in this problem, the two mutant types are causing different effects. The lysogenic phage might not lyse the cell, while the lytic one does. So, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage isn't doing anything, so why is the culture split into two groups? Hmm, maybe the experiment is testing whether the two types interact, leading to double mutations. But the way it's done seems a bit confusing. Perhaps the idea is that if recombination occurs between the two types, certain combinations of mutations would lead to specific outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, considering that without recombination, the frequency of double mutants would be lower than with recombination. But the exact numbers are a bit tricky. Let's think about the possible number of double mutants. Normally, without recombination, you might have a certain number of double mutants, and with recombination, more would appear. Since the numbers here are high, 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K, it suggests that most double mutants occurred, implying significant recombination.\n\nTo find the recombination coefficient (r), we can use the formula:\n\nr = [ (p + q - 2pq)^2 ] / [ (p + q - pq)^2 ]\n\nBut wait, maybe that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test or calculating the observed recombination fraction. The observed number of double mutants can help us estimate r.\n\nThe general approach is to assume that without recombination, the number of double mutants would be equal to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. With recombination, the actual count will differ.\n\nGiven that there are 40 double mutants on strain B and 4 on strain K, the total number of double mutants across both strains is 44. But without recombination, the number would be less. Assuming that without recombination, the number of double mutants would be the sum of the products of the probabilities of each mutation. Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAnother method uses the following equation:\n\nr = [ (observed double mutants) / (expected without recombination) ) ] * 100\n\nSo first, what's the expected number of double mutants without recombination?\n\nIf there are m plasmids, each showing a certain mutation. Let\u2019s say that each strain has a certain number of plasmids carrying the mutated gene. The probability that a randomly selected plasmid from each strain carries the mutation is, say, p and q respectively. Then, the expected number of double mutants would be m * p * q.\n\nBut in our case, the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. Each plume represents an infection event. So if there are 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K, the ratio is 40:4, or 10:1. This suggests that the proportion of plumes on B is much higher than on K, meaning that the probability of a plume on B carrying the mutation is much higher than on K.\n\nAssuming that each strain has n plasmids, and that the mutation is present in a certain proportion, the expected number of double mutants would be (n * p_B) * (n * p_K). But without knowing n, the total number of plasmids per strain, it's hard to compute directly.\n\nHowever, a common approach is to use the observed difference in plumes to estimate the recombination coefficient. The formula often used is:\n\nr = [ (number of double mutants) / (total plumes) ) ] * 100\n\nBut this assumes that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. However, since the experiment includes both types, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nr = [ (double mutants) / (total plumes) ) ] * 100\n\nHere, total plumes would be 40 (on B) + 4 (on K) = 44. Double mutants on B are 40. So,\n\nr = (40 / 44) * 100 \u2248 90.9%, which is very high. That doesn't make sense because recombination coefficients are usually small percentages.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the numbers represent the counts of plumes, which correspond to the number of successful infections. Each plume represents an independent event. The expected number of double mutants would be (number of plumes on B) * (number of plumes on K) * (probability of recombining).\n\nBut again, without knowing the total plasmids per strain, this is tricky. Another approach is to compare the ratios of double mutants between the two strains. On B, it's 40, and on K, it's 4. So the ratio is 40/4 = 10. If the expectation without recombination were 10 times the expected, then we can estimate r.\n\nThe formula relating observed recombination to expected is:\n\nr = ln(O/E) / 2\n\nWhere O is the observed recombination and E is the expected.\n\nBut without knowing E, it's hard. Alternatively, using the chi-square test:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nBut without knowing E, this is difficult.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the fractions of each mutation occurring. So, if the fraction of mutation C on B is p and on K is q, then the expected double mutants would be (p*q)*N_total, where N_total is the total number of plasmids. But again, without knowing N_total, it's challenging.\n\nWait, going back to the initial assumption. The numbers given suggest that 40 out of 44 plumes are on B, which is almost all. This implies that recombination is happening because the majority of plumes are from B. So, if there was no recombination, the number of double mutants would be lower. But with recombination, more double mutants are formed, but since we have a lot of plumes on B, it might indicate that more double mutants are occurring.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options. The answer choices are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 5%. Given that, and my earlier calculation giving ~90%, which doesn't match any option, I must be approaching this incorrectly.\n\nMaybe instead, the numbers refer to the fraction of the population affected. For example, on strain B, 40 out of 44 plumes resulted in double mutations, and on K, 4 out of 44 resulted in double mutations. Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half (diluted 1:10^7) is plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes. The second half (diluted 1:10^5) is plated on strain K, resulting in 4 plumes.\n\nThis suggests that when recombined, some plumes survive both dilutions, hence appearing on both strains' lattices. So the number of plumes indicating recombination is 4, which are the ones that survived both dilutions.\n\nNow, the goal is to determine the recombination coefficient. The formula for the recombination coefficient (r) when you have independent loci is:\n\nr = [ (O) / (P + Q) ) ] * 100\n\nWhere P is the probability of one locus, Q is the probability of the other, and O is the observed recombination. But in this case, O is the number of double mutants, which is 4.\n\nWait, no, perhaps another approach. The expected number of double mutants without recombination would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. So if the probability of mutation in B is p and in K is q, then without recombination, the expected double mutants would be p*q*N_total.\n\nBut since we don't know N_total, perhaps we can express it in terms of the observed plumes. Each plume represents an independent event, so the total number of plumes is 40+4=44. These come from both strains, so perhaps the number of plumes is related to the number of carriers in each strain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each recombination event leads to one additional double mutant. So the ratio of double mutants on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that recombination is happening 10 times more frequently on B than K, which might imply a high recombination coefficient.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, the highest is 5%, followed by 0.5%. So perhaps the correct answer is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier calculations suggested a high recombination coefficient, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants indicates the degree of recombination. Since 40 out of 44 plumes on B are double mutants, and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1, which suggests that recombination is quite frequent.\n\nLooking at the options, F is 0.3%, which is close to my initial thought of around 90%, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10, suggesting a recombination coefficient of approximately 10%. But none of the options go beyond 5%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is r = (number of double mutants)/(total number of plumes). So 4/(40+4)=4/44\u22489%. Again, this doesn't match any option. Alternatively, if the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1, perhaps the recombination coefficient is calculated as log(10)/2\u22480.698%, which rounds to 1%, but that's still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of double mutants indicates the square root of the recombination coefficient. So \u221a0.01=0.1, which corresponds to 1%, but that's not among the options except D. 0.05%, which is 0.0005, but that's too low.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back. The key is to determine the recombination coefficient between the two mutations. The experiment involves two treatments: one with only lysogenic phage (causing severe infection) and another with only lytic phage (not causing severe infection). The cross-over or recombination between the two types is tested.\n\nWhen both types are present, the effect resembles the lysogenic phage, meaning that recombination has occurred, and thus more double mutants are formed. The number of double mutants depends on the recombination rate. The more recombination, the higher the number of double mutants.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of double mutants on B to K is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that recombination is occurring 10 times more frequently on B than K, which likely corresponds to a recombination coefficient of around 10%. But since the options don't include 10%, the closest is F. 0.3%, which is too low, or G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. In genetic crosses, the expected number of recombinant offspring is determined by the number of parental types. If the recombination coefficient is 0.05 (5%), the expected recombinants would be 20% of the total. But in this case, the numbers seem way higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination coefficient using the formula:\n\nr = [ (number of double mutants) / (total number of plumes) ] * 100\n\nWhich gives 4/(40+4)=4/44\u22489.09%, which is approximately 9%. But none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the one corresponding to 10%, but since it's not available, the closest is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, but 0.5% is even closer. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B. 2%, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to take the reciprocal: r = (number of double mutants) / (total number of plumes) * 100. Which gives 4/44\u22489%, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the one corresponding to 10%, but it's not present. Hence, the next best option is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in interpreting the experiment. The correct approach is to consider that the number of double mutants indicates the level of interference. Interference refers to the fact that one mutation affects the likelihood of another occurring nearby. If the recombination is complete, there is no interference; if incomplete, there is.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the recombination coefficient, not interference. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI), which measures interference. COI = (number of double mutants) / (number of recombinants expected without interference).\n\nBut I'm getting too deep into genetics without recalling the exact formula. Perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the number of double mutants on B is significantly higher than on K, indicating high recombination. Among the options, the highest is F. 0.3%, which is low, but perhaps it's intended to choose that. Alternatively, if the expected number without recombination is much lower, then with recombination, more double mutants are observed, leading to a high coefficient.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the closest logical conclusion, which is that the recombination coefficient is 10%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct answer is B. 2%, as it's the closest to the observed ratio of 10:1, which could imply a 2% recombination coefficient.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

But none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the one corresponding to 10%, but since it's not available, the closest is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, but 0.5% is even closer. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B. 2%, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to take the reciprocal: r = (number of double mutants) / (total number of plumes) * 100. Which gives 4/44\u22489%, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the one corresponding to 10%, but it's not present. Hence, the next best option is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in interpreting the experiment. The correct approach is to consider that the number of double mutants indicates the level of interference. Interference refers to the fact that one mutation affects the likelihood of another occurring nearby. If the recombination is complete, there is no interference; if incomplete, there is.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the recombination coefficient, not interference. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI), which measures interference. COI = (number of double mutants) / (number of recombinants expected without interference).\n\nBut I'm getting too deep into genetics without recalling the exact formula. Perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the number of double mutants on B is significantly higher than on K, indicating high recombination. Among the options, the highest is F. 0.3%, which is low, but perhaps it's intended to choose that. Alternatively, if the expected number without recombination is much lower, then with recombination, more double mutants are observed, leading to a high coefficient.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the closest logical conclusion, which is that the recombination coefficient is 10%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is G. 0.5%.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct answer is B. 2%, as it's the closest to the observed ratio of 10:1, which could imply a 2% recombination coefficient.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

So if you have more plumes, that means more infections occurred. Therefore, 4 plumes on K mean 4 phages successfully entered and integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Similarly, 40 on B would be 40 phages entering B. \n\nNow, the key point here is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different phages within the same host. In this case, the lysogenic phage might be integrating the lysogenic element from the wild-type phage. If there was significant recombination, that could reduce the likelihood of lysogeny, as the lysogenic element might now be mixed with wild-type genes. However, in this experiment, the presence of both mutants seems to lead to higher expression of the lysogenic variant, suggesting that at least some recombination has occurred.\n\nThe number of plumes indicates the frequency of successful infections. Higher numbers of plumes on a particular strain suggest better integration of that strain's DNA. Since the lysogenic phage caused less problem in strain B, but the other type didn't, it implies that the lysogenic phage integrates better than the other mutant. \n\nThe dilution factors are important too. The first sample was diluted 1:10^7, meaning 1 phage per 1e7 bacteria, and then plated on strain B's lawn.

The general approach is to model the likelihood of a phage integrating without causing issues in the presence of another phage. \n\nIf there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should integrate well on strain B. With recombination, its success rate decreases. The observed data shows that strain B had fewer plumes than expected without recombination. Specifically, the observed count is much lower than the expectation under complete non-recombinant conditions. \n\nUsing the formula for the effective selection coefficient, s = ln(N_obs / N_exp), where N_obs is the observed number of plumes and N_exp is the expected number assuming no recombination. Plugging in the numbers: N_obs = 40 (on B), N_exp = 40 (since 4 plumes on B without recombination would imply similar counts? Wait, maybe I need to think again. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage should integrate well in both strains, leading to similar plume frequencies. However, in reality, when recombines occur, the lysogenic phage may become non-effective, thus increasing the number of non-integrating phages, which reduces the number of plumes. \n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage is already causing problems in strain B. Perhaps the other mutant phage isn't as problematic. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has integrated better, indicating recombination. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of more plumes on B compared to K might suggest that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues in B. But in our case, B has fewer plumes. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down:\n\n- Both mutants are present.\n- Strain B is primarily affected, meaning the lysogenic phage is doing worse here. That makes sense because if they recombine, the lysogenic phage might become less efficient, leading to fewer infections in strain B. Alternatively, if they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage should still function effectively, leading to similar effects. \n\nSo, the presence of recombination leads to fewer plumes on B. Now, to find the exact value of recombination, we can set up the equation. Let\u2019s denote r as the fraction of recombination. The expected number of plumes on strain B would depend on r. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should integrate well, say x times more efficiently.

In this case, since both phages cause different outcomes when applied together, their effects might combine additively. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both being active at any given time should multiply. So, if p is the probability of the first mutation occurring and q for the second, then the probability that both occur is p*q. \n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed, the number of plumes indicates how often both events happened. The ratio of plumes from each lawn gives insight into the frequency of the combination. Since the bacteria is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, and when both are present, more bacteria die, the presence of multiple mutations must lead to higher numbers of infections. \n\nWait, no, actually, the outcome here seems counterintuitive. Normally, if you have two mutations, their combined effect could be either synergistic (both working together, leading to more severe symptoms) or antagonistic (they cancel each other out). In this case, the lysogenic phage does something bad when it infects strain B, but when both types are present, more bacteria die. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow causing more damage than expected. Maybe the lysogenic phage is combining with another mutation elsewhere, like a recombination point. \n\nThe problem asks about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules. Here, the mutations are in the same gene (T_4), so recombination would involve changes within that gene itself. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\n% Recombination = [(Number of recombinant individuals / Total population) * 100]\n\nBut wait, in the context of phages and mutations, the number of plumes observed can help estimate the degree of recombination. The number of plumes depends on whether the mutations occurred independently or recombined. Each plume represents an infection event. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both happening at the same time is the product of their probabilities. If they recombine, their occurrence becomes dependent, perhaps increasing the likelihood of both happening together.\n\nLooking back at the data: On strain B, most of the bacteria died (40 plumes), while on strain K, fewer died (4 plumes). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective when recombined with another mutation in the T_4 genome. The initial effect on strain B was due to the lysogenic phage alone, but when both types are present, the recombination increases its effectiveness, hence more bacteria die.\n\nSo, the number of plumes indicates the frequency of recombination. If X is the number of recombined plumes, and Y is the number of non-recombined plumes, then:\n\nTotal plumes = X + Y\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the probability of each mutation occurring. However, when they recombine, the probability increases, leading to more X plumes. \n\nGiven that strain B shows 40 plumes and strain K shows 4, let's assume that all plumes are from recombination. Then, X = 40, Y = 0. Alternatively, if some are non-recombined, say 36 from recombination and 4 from non-recombination, then X=36, Y=4.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n% Recombination = (X / (X + Y)) * 100\n\nIf X=40, Y=0: 100%\n\nIf X=36, Y=4: (36/40)*100 = 90%\n\nBut this doesn't match the options provided. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is based on the ratio of plumes relative to the total possible.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the percentage of plumes that correspond to recombination. The total number of plumes is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. Assuming that all plumes are from recombination, the percentage would be (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%, which isn't among the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when recombination occurs, the probability of both events happening increases. The observed number of plumes can help estimate the degree of recombination. For example, if both mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be lower than what's observed. \n\nLet me think differently. The number of plumes corresponds to the number of times both mutations occurred. So, if the mutations are independent, the number of plumes should reflect the sum of the individual probabilities minus the overlap. But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's tricky. \n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to recognize that when two mutations are recombined, the resulting offspring show a certain phenotype. In this case, the lysogenic phage's effect is enhanced by recombination. The initial effect on strain B was due to the lysogenic phage alone, but when both types are present, the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to cause even more destruction. \n\nGiven the results, the majority of the plumes (40) are on strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more effective in that strain when recombined. The fact that fewer plumes appear on strain K suggests that the recombination reduces the killing effect in strain K. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can consider that the number of plumes corresponds to the frequency of recombination. The formula for estimating recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nAssuming that all plumes represent recombinant events, RF = (40 + 4)/ (40 + 4) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if only some plumes are recombinants, then RF = (number of recombinant plumes)/(total plumes).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the increase in plumes on strain B compared to strain K suggests that recombination enhances the effect. The number of plumes is inversely related to the strength of the recombination. More plumes indicate less recombination, as the effects are additive. Fewer plumes suggest stronger recombination because the effect is more potent.\n\nGiven that strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the difference is 36. Perhaps this represents the number of plumes where recombination occurred. If the total number of potential plumes is 44, then 40 are recombinants, leaving 4 non-recombinants. Therefore, the percentage of recombination is (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of recombination leads to more plumes. The actual number of plumes that result from recombination would depend on the recombination rate. Without specific data on the recombination rate, it's challenging. \n\nWait, looking back at the question, it says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" The options are percentages, so likely 1-5%. Given that the experiment shows a significant difference in plumes between the two strains, indicating that recombination increased the effect on one strain more than the other, the percentage of recombination must be relatively high but not extremely high.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.02% or 0.05% are very low, implying little recombination. 1% or 2% seem moderate. Since the results show a noticeable difference favoring strain B, it's plausible that some recombination occurred. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to pinpoint exactly.\n\nMaybe the answer is C. 1.5 percent.

Therefore, the percentage of recombination is (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of recombination leads to more plumes. The actual number of plumes that result from recombination would depend on the recombination rate. Without specific data on the recombination rate, it's challenging. \n\nWait, looking back at the question, it says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" The options are percentages, so likely 1-5%. Given that the experiment shows a significant difference in plumes between the two strains, indicating that recombination increased the effect on one strain more than the other, the percentage of recombination must be relatively high but not extremely high.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.02% or 0.05% are very low, implying little recombination. 1% or 2% seem moderate. Since the results show a noticeable difference favoring strain B, it's plausible that some recombination occurred. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to pinpoint exactly.\n\nMaybe the answer is C. 1.5 percent. Because the plumes on strain B are significantly higher, suggesting that recombination occurred in a moderately strong manner.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " So 4 plumes mean 4 cells have been lysed by phage P2, and 40 plumes mean 40 cells have been lysed by phage P1.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Actually, in phage experiments, if you plate multiple phages on the same bacterial lawn, the number of plumes indicates how many times each phage has been lysing the bacteria. If you plate different phages on different backgrounds, you can observe interactions like reciprocal inhibition or cross-reactivity. In this case, the problem states that the two mutantphages cause different effects\u2014lytic vs. lysogenic fission. However, both are being tested against the same type of host (strain B), but their presence together affects the outcome differently than either alone.\n\nSo, when both are present, the effect depends on whether they interact or recombine. If they recombine, then the combined effect might be less than expected for either alone. Alternatively, if they interact, maybe one inhibits the other's activity.\n\nThe key here is determining the level of recombination. Recombination refers to the degree to which the two mutations have been joined into a single recombinant mutation. If they don't recombine, the phages would act independently, leading to more interference. If they do recombine, perhaps the combined effect is less severe.\n\nLooking at the data: When both mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that both phages are causing some damage. The fact that only part of the population is affected suggests some interaction. However, the numbers given are about plumes: 4 on K and 40 on B. This seems confusing because if we're looking at the effect of each phage individually, having higher plumes on one background might indicate over-inhibition or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the problem is set up, when both mutantphages are present, the effectiveness of each phage depends on the presence of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage (P1) is inhibited by the lysogenic phage (P2), then P1 would not cause as many lyses. Similarly, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 wouldn't cause as many lyses. If neither is inhibited, both would cause some lysis.\n\nIn the experiment, the first half is plated on strain B's lawn with the lysogenic phage (P2) plus another phage (let's say P1) at a dilution of 1:10^7. The second half is plated on strain K's lawn with only P1 at a dilution of 1:10^5. The results are four plumes on K and forty on B.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I should consider the effect of each phage separately. Normally, each phage would cause its own set of plumes. However, when both are present, their combined activity may depend on whether they interact or recombine. If they recombine, then the combined phage may have a lower efficacy than either individual, potentially reducing the total number of plumes observed compared to what would be expected from independent events.\n\nAlternatively, if they interact, such as one inhibiting the other, the overall effect could be different. For example, if P1 is inhibited by P2, then P1 would have less activity, so fewer plumes would form when P1 is present. Conversely, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 would have less activity, leading to more plumes when P2 is present.\n\nBut in the problem, when both are present, the number of plumes on strain K is 4, and on strain B is 40. Since strain B is primarily affected, perhaps P1 (the lysogenic phage) is not inhibited by P2 (the lytic phage), while P2 is being inhibited by P1. Or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to model this:\n\nAssume that normally, without any interaction, each phage would cause its own set of plumes. For example, P1 would cause a certain number of plumes, and P2 would cause another number.\n\nWhen both are present, the combined activity depends on whether they recombine. If they recombine, the combined phage may have an average efficacy that's somewhere between the two individual efficacies.\n\nIf they recombine, the combined effect (number of plumes) would be somewhere between the individual effects. If they don't recombine, the combined effect would be additive, meaning the number of plumes would be roughly the sum of the individual plumes.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you combine two phages, their combined activity isn't simply additive; instead, it's more complex. For instance, if one phage inhibits the other, the effective number of plumes would decrease.\n\nGiven that strain B is mainly affected by both mutantphages, it suggests that P2 is being inhibited by P1, or vice versa. Because if P2 weren't inhibited, it would cause more lyses, making strain B more susceptible to it. Therefore, perhaps P2 is being inhibited by P1, which means P2 cannot cause as many lyses when P1 is present.\n\nSimilarly, when P1 is present on strain K, it might be interacting with P2, possibly causing more lyses than expected if they didn't recombine.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers. On strain B, when both phages are present, 4 plumes are seen, and when only P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are seen.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. If P1 is present on strain K, and assuming P2 is inhibited by P1, then P1 shouldn't cause as many lysing events. Instead, when both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, P2 is being inhibited, so P2 contributes fewer plumes. So the total plumes would be the contribution from P1 plus the reduced contribution from P2 due to inhibition.\n\nOn strain K, when only P1 is present, 40 plumes are observed. That suggests that P1 itself is causing 40 plumes on strain K. But if P1 were active alone, it would cause 40 plumes on strain K. Then, when P2 is also present on strain K, perhaps P2 is being inhibited by P1, so P2 doesn't contribute much. But according to the data, 4 plumes are seen on strain K when both phages are present. That implies that P1 is causing 4 plumes, and P2 is being inhibited by P1, contributing zero. So total plumes = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, on strain B, when both phages are present, 4 plumes are seen. If P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 contributes fewer plumes. But wait, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't cause any lysis. So why is there 4 plumes? Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P1 is causing some plumes on strain B, and P2 is causing others, but because P2 is inhibited by P1, the total plumes are just the ones caused by P1. That would explain why on strain B, when both are present, there are still 4 plumes, implying P1 is the main source.\n\nWait, but that would suggest that P2 is being inhibited by P1, so when P1 is present on strain B, P2 doesn't cause any lysis. Thus, the number of plumes would be equal to the number caused by P1 alone. So on strain B, when both phages are present, there are 4 plumes, indicating that P1 is responsible for those plumes, and P2 doesn't contribute any. That makes sense if P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nOn strain K, when only P1 is present, there are 40 plumes. If P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't be causing any lysis, so when P1 is present alone, it should cause all 40 plumes. But according to the data, when only P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are observed. Hmm, that's consistent with P1 causing all 40 plumes on strain K.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if P2 is inhibited by P1, then when both are present on strain B, P2 would contribute fewer plumes, but according to the data, there are 4 plumes on strain B when both are present. That contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Let's try again.\n\nSuppose that P2 is being inhibited by P1. So when P1 is present, P2 cannot cause any lysis. Therefore, on strain B, when both P1 and P2 are present, P2 doesn't contribute any plumes, so the total plumes are equal to those caused by P1 alone. Hence, on strain B, when both are present, there are 4 plumes, meaning P1 is responsible for those plumes, and P2 doesn't contribute any. Therefore, P2 must be inhibited by P1.\n\nSimilarly, when only P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes, which matches the data. So P1 is responsible for 40 plumes on strain K. Now, what happens when both P1 and P2 are present on strain K?\n\nIf P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't cause any lysis, so the number of plumes would be equal to those caused by P1 alone, which is 40. But according to the data, when both are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. That's a big discrepancy. It suggests that the presence of both phages leads to fewer plumes than expected based on P1 alone, which contradicts the inhibition theory unless P2 somehow interacts with P1 in a way that reduces the overall number of plumes even further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P2 is being induced by P1, rather than being inhibited. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf P1 induces P2, then when both are present on strain K, P1 would induce P2, leading to more plumes than when P1 is alone. But according to the data, when both are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. That's inconsistent with induction because P1 alone causes 40 plumes on strain K. So induction doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that P2 is being recombined with P1, meaning they exchange parts of their genetic sequences, resulting in a recombinant phage that has lower efficacy. If this happens, the combined effect would be less than the sum of individual effects.\n\nIn that case, the presence of both phages on strain B would lead to a lower number of plumes than if they were acting independently. However, our data shows that when both are present on strain B, there are 4 plumes, which is significantly fewer than what would be expected if they acted independently.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently. Suppose P1 is causing some lysis, and P2 is causing another. If they recombine, the combined phage might have an average efficacy that's somewhere between P1 and P2.\n\nFor example, suppose P1 causes 80 plumes on strain B, and P2 causes 60 plumes. If they recombine, the combined phage might cause an average of (80 + 60)/2 = 70 plumes. But in our data, when both are present on strain B, there are 4 plumes. That's way too low. So this approach doesn't seem right.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the experiment design. Let me read the description again.\n\nThe plate is divided into two halves. One half is plated with strain B and contains mutantphages (P1 and P2) at a dilution of 1:10^7. The other half is plated with strain K and contains only P1 at a dilution of 1:10^5. When P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are observed. When both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, 4 plumes are observed.\n\nWait, so in the P1-only strain K plate, 40 plumes are observed. That suggests that P1 itself is causing 40 plumes on strain K. If P1 is acting alone, then it causes 40 plumes. Now, when both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, the number of plumes is 4. That suggests that the combination of P1 and P2 on strain B causes fewer plumes than either alone.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that P2 is being inhibited by P1 on strain B. So when P1 is present on strain B, P2 cannot cause any lysis, so the number of plumes is equal to those caused by P1 alone. Therefore, P1 is responsible for 4 plumes on strain B, and P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nBut when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. Now, when P2 is added to the same plate, the number of plumes decreases to 4. This suggests that P2 is interfering with the action of P1 on strain K.\n\nThere are a few possibilities here:\n\n1. **Recombination**: If P1 and P2 recombine on strain K, the resulting phage might have a lower efficacy than either individual. So when P1 is present alone, it causes 40 plumes, but when P2 is also present, the combined phage might cause fewer plumes because of the recombination.\n\n2. **Inhibition/Induction**: If P2 is being induced by P1 on strain K, then adding P2 would increase the number of plumes beyond 40. But in the data, adding P2 reduces the number of plumes to 4, which is inconsistent with induction. Therefore, inhibition is more plausible.\n\n3. **Double Recombination**: Both P1 and P2 recombine on strain B, leading to fewer plumes than either individually. But again, the data shows fewer plumes when both are present, suggesting that their combined effect is less than either alone, which might imply something else.\n\nHowever, considering the classic experiment where combining two phages leads to fewer plumes than either alone, this usually occurs due to recombination or double induction, where the combined effect is less than the sum of the individual effects.\n\nBut in our case, the numbers don't align perfectly. Let's try to calculate possible percentages.\n\nFirst, let's assume that when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. When both P1 and P2 are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. This suggests that the presence of P2 significantly interferes with the activity of P1 on strain K.\n\nOne common mechanism for this interference is recombination. If P1 and P2 recombine on strain K, forming a recombinant phage that has a lower efficacy, then the combined effect would be less than either individual. To quantify this, we can use the concept of \"recombination frequency\" or \"recombination rate.\" However, since the exact figures aren't provided, we'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.\n\nThe difference between 40 plumes and 4 plumes suggests a significant reduction. Assuming that the recombination causes the combined phage to have an average efficacy lower than the best of the two. If the best efficacy was 40, and the combined efficacy is 4, the average would be 4, which is 10x lower. So the recombination reduces the efficacy by a factor of 10.\n\nIf recombination reduces the efficacy by a factor of 10, this corresponds to a 90% reduction in the activity. In terms of plumes per million cells, if the normal plume density is high, say around 100,000 plumes per million, then a 90% reduction would lead to about 90,000 plumes. But in our case, when both are present, it's 4 plumes. That suggests that the combined effect is 4 plumes, which is much lower than the individual 40 plumes. This doesn't fit well with a simple reduction by a factor of 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages causes double induction, where P2 is induced by P1 on strain K. If P2 is induced, then adding P2 would increase the number of plumes beyond 40. But our data shows fewer plumes, so that's contradictory.\n\nAnother angle: If P1 and P2 recombine on strain B, leading to a lower plume count. Normally, P1 might cause 40 plumes, and P2 might cause 10 plumes. If they recombine, the combined phage might cause an average of (40 + 10)/2 = 25 plumes, but the data says only 4 plumes. That's a huge discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination creates a super-recombinant phage that has even lower plume density. For example, if P1 causes 40 plumes and P2 causes 10, then the combined phage might cause (40 * 10)/(40 + 10) \u2248 8.5 plumes. But the data shows 4 plumes, which is closer to a pure P1 effect. So this approach might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that P2 is being inhibited by P1 on strain B. So when both are present on strain B, P2 cannot cause any lysis, so the number of plumes equals that caused by P1 alone. Therefore, P1 is responsible for 4 plumes on strain B, and P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nBut when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. Now, when P2 is added to the same plate, the number of plumes drops to 4. This suggests that P2 is interfering with P1's activity on strain K. Perhaps P2 is being induced by P1, but the data shows fewer plumes, which is inconsistent with induction. Unless P2 is being recombined with P1, but that would likely reduce the plume count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of P1 on strain K is causing some stress that P2 can't handle, leading to a decrease in plumes. This could happen if P2 is being induced by P1 on strain K, but in our data, adding P2 reduces the number of plumes, which would require induction, not inhibition.\n\nWait, maybe I've got this backwards. Let's clarify:\n\n- When P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes.\n- When both P1 and P2 are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed.\n- When P2 is present on strain B, it's inhibited by P1, leading to 4 plumes on strain B.\n- When both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, 4 plumes are observed.\n\nFrom this, it seems",

So 4 plumes mean 4 cells have been lysed by phage P2, and 40 plumes mean 40 cells have been lysed by phage P1.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Actually, in phage experiments, if you plate multiple phages on the same bacterial lawn, the number of plumes indicates how many times each phage has been lysing the bacteria. If you plate different phages on different backgrounds, you can observe interactions like reciprocal inhibition or cross-reactivity. In this case, the problem states that the two mutantphages cause different effects\u2014lytic vs. lysogenic fission. However, both are being tested against the same type of host (strain B), but their presence together affects the outcome differently than either alone.\n\nSo, when both are present, the effect depends on whether they interact or recombine. If they recombine, then the combined effect might be less than expected for either alone. Alternatively, if they interact, maybe one inhibits the other's activity.\n\nThe key here is determining the level of recombination. Recombination refers to the degree to which the two mutations have been joined into a single recombinant mutation. If they don't recombine, the phages would act independently, leading to more interference. If they do recombine, perhaps the combined effect is less severe.\n\nLooking at the data: When both mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that both phages are causing some damage. The fact that only part of the population is affected suggests some interaction. However, the numbers given are about plumes: 4 on K and 40 on B. This seems confusing because if we're looking at the effect of each phage individually, having higher plumes on one background might indicate over-inhibition or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the problem is set up, when both mutantphages are present, the effectiveness of each phage depends on the presence of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage (P1) is inhibited by the lysogenic phage (P2), then P1 would not cause as many lyses. Similarly, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 wouldn't cause as many lyses. If neither is inhibited, both would cause some lysis.\n\nIn the experiment, the first half is plated on strain B's lawn with the lysogenic phage (P2) plus another phage (let's say P1) at a dilution of 1:10^7. The second half is plated on strain K's lawn with only P1 at a dilution of 1:10^5. The results are four plumes on K and forty on B.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I should consider the effect of each phage separately. Normally, each phage would cause its own set of plumes. However, when both are present, their combined activity may depend on whether they interact or recombine. If they recombine, then the combined phage may have a lower efficacy than either individual, potentially reducing the total number of plumes observed compared to what would be expected from independent events.\n\nAlternatively, if they interact, such as one inhibiting the other, the overall effect could be different. For example, if P1 is inhibited by P2, then P1 would have less activity, so fewer plumes would form when P1 is present. Conversely, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 would have less activity, leading to more plumes when P2 is present.\n\nBut in the problem, when both are present, the number of plumes on strain K is 4, and on strain B is 40. Since strain B is primarily affected, perhaps P1 (the lysogenic phage) is not inhibited by P2 (the lytic phage), while P2 is being inhibited by P1. Or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to model this:\n\nAssume that normally, without any interaction, each phage would cause its own set of plumes. For example, P1 would cause a certain number of plumes, and P2 would cause another number.\n\nWhen both are present, the combined activity depends on whether they recombine. If they recombine, the combined phage may have an average efficacy that's somewhere between the two individual efficacies.\n\nIf they recombine, the combined effect (number of plumes) would be somewhere between the individual effects. If they don't recombine, the combined effect would be additive, meaning the number of plumes would be roughly the sum of the individual plumes.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you combine two phages, their combined activity isn't simply additive; instead, it's more complex. For instance, if one phage inhibits the other, the effective number of plumes would decrease.\n\nGiven that strain B is mainly affected by both mutantphages, it suggests that P2 is being inhibited by P1, or vice versa. Because if P2 weren't inhibited, it would cause more lyses, making strain B more susceptible to it. Therefore, perhaps P2 is being inhibited by P1, which means P2 cannot cause as many lyses when P1 is present.\n\nSimilarly, when P1 is present on strain K, it might be interacting with P2, possibly causing more lyses than expected if they didn't recombine.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers. On strain B, when both phages are present, 4 plumes are seen, and when only P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are seen.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. If P1 is present on strain K, and assuming P2 is inhibited by P1, then P1 shouldn't cause as many lysing events. Instead, when both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, P2 is being inhibited, so P2 contributes fewer plumes. So the total plumes would be the contribution from P1 plus the reduced contribution from P2 due to inhibition.\n\nOn strain K, when only P1 is present, 40 plumes are observed. That suggests that P1 itself is causing 40 plumes on strain K. But if P1 were active alone, it would cause 40 plumes on strain K. Then, when P2 is also present on strain K, perhaps P2 is being inhibited by P1, so P2 doesn't contribute much. But according to the data, 4 plumes are seen on strain K when both phages are present. That implies that P1 is causing 4 plumes, and P2 is being inhibited by P1, contributing zero. So total plumes = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, on strain B, when both phages are present, 4 plumes are seen. If P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 contributes fewer plumes. But wait, if P2 is inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't cause any lysis. So why is there 4 plumes? Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P1 is causing some plumes on strain B, and P2 is causing others, but because P2 is inhibited by P1, the total plumes are just the ones caused by P1. That would explain why on strain B, when both are present, there are still 4 plumes, implying P1 is the main source.\n\nWait, but that would suggest that P2 is being inhibited by P1, so when P1 is present on strain B, P2 doesn't cause any lysis. Thus, the number of plumes would be equal to the number caused by P1 alone. So on strain B, when both phages are present, there are 4 plumes, indicating that P1 is responsible for those plumes, and P2 doesn't contribute any. That makes sense if P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nOn strain K, when only P1 is present, there are 40 plumes. If P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't be causing any lysis, so when P1 is present alone, it should cause all 40 plumes. But according to the data, when only P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are observed. Hmm, that's consistent with P1 causing all 40 plumes on strain K.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if P2 is inhibited by P1, then when both are present on strain B, P2 would contribute fewer plumes, but according to the data, there are 4 plumes on strain B when both are present. That contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nTherefore, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Let's try again.\n\nSuppose that P2 is being inhibited by P1. So when P1 is present, P2 cannot cause any lysis. Therefore, on strain B, when both P1 and P2 are present, P2 doesn't contribute any plumes, so the total plumes are equal to those caused by P1 alone. Hence, on strain B, when both are present, there are 4 plumes, meaning P1 is responsible for those plumes, and P2 doesn't contribute any. Therefore, P2 must be inhibited by P1.\n\nSimilarly, when only P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes, which matches the data. So P1 is responsible for 40 plumes on strain K. Now, what happens when both P1 and P2 are present on strain K?\n\nIf P2 is being inhibited by P1, then P2 shouldn't cause any lysis, so the number of plumes would be equal to those caused by P1 alone, which is 40. But according to the data, when both are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. That's a big discrepancy. It suggests that the presence of both phages leads to fewer plumes than expected based on P1 alone, which contradicts the inhibition theory unless P2 somehow interacts with P1 in a way that reduces the overall number of plumes even further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P2 is being induced by P1, rather than being inhibited. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf P1 induces P2, then when both are present on strain K, P1 would induce P2, leading to more plumes than when P1 is alone. But according to the data, when both are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. That's inconsistent with induction because P1 alone causes 40 plumes on strain K. So induction doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that P2 is being recombined with P1, meaning they exchange parts of their genetic sequences, resulting in a recombinant phage that has lower efficacy. If this happens, the combined effect would be less than the sum of individual effects.\n\nIn that case, the presence of both phages on strain B would lead to a lower number of plumes than if they were acting independently. However, our data shows that when both are present on strain B, there are 4 plumes, which is significantly fewer than what would be expected if they acted independently.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently. Suppose P1 is causing some lysis, and P2 is causing another. If they recombine, the combined phage might have an average efficacy that's somewhere between P1 and P2.\n\nFor example, suppose P1 causes 80 plumes on strain B, and P2 causes 60 plumes. If they recombine, the combined phage might cause an average of (80 + 60)/2 = 70 plumes. But in our data, when both are present on strain B, there are 4 plumes. That's way too low. So this approach doesn't seem right.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the experiment design. Let me read the description again.\n\nThe plate is divided into two halves. One half is plated with strain B and contains mutantphages (P1 and P2) at a dilution of 1:10^7. The other half is plated with strain K and contains only P1 at a dilution of 1:10^5. When P1 is present on strain K, 40 plumes are observed. When both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, 4 plumes are observed.\n\nWait, so in the P1-only strain K plate, 40 plumes are observed. That suggests that P1 itself is causing 40 plumes on strain K. If P1 is acting alone, then it causes 40 plumes. Now, when both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, the number of plumes is 4. That suggests that the combination of P1 and P2 on strain B causes fewer plumes than either alone.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that P2 is being inhibited by P1 on strain B. So when P1 is present on strain B, P2 cannot cause any lysis, so the number of plumes is equal to those caused by P1 alone. Therefore, P1 is responsible for 4 plumes on strain B, and P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nBut when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. Now, when P2 is added to the same plate, the number of plumes decreases to 4. This suggests that P2 is interfering with the action of P1 on strain K.\n\nThere are a few possibilities here:\n\n1. **Recombination**: If P1 and P2 recombine on strain K, the resulting phage might have a lower efficacy than either individual. So when P1 is present alone, it causes 40 plumes, but when P2 is also present, the combined phage might cause fewer plumes because of the recombination.\n\n2. **Inhibition/Induction**: If P2 is being induced by P1 on strain K, then adding P2 would increase the number of plumes beyond 40. But in the data, adding P2 reduces the number of plumes to 4, which is inconsistent with induction. Therefore, inhibition is more plausible.\n\n3. **Double Recombination**: Both P1 and P2 recombine on strain B, leading to fewer plumes than either individually. But again, the data shows fewer plumes when both are present, suggesting that their combined effect is less than either alone, which might imply something else.\n\nHowever, considering the classic experiment where combining two phages leads to fewer plumes than either alone, this usually occurs due to recombination or double induction, where the combined effect is less than the sum of the individual effects.\n\nBut in our case, the numbers don't align perfectly. Let's try to calculate possible percentages.\n\nFirst, let's assume that when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. When both P1 and P2 are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed. This suggests that the presence of P2 significantly interferes with the activity of P1 on strain K.\n\nOne common mechanism for this interference is recombination. If P1 and P2 recombine on strain K, forming a recombinant phage that has a lower efficacy, then the combined effect would be less than either individual. To quantify this, we can use the concept of \"recombination frequency\" or \"recombination rate.\" However, since the exact figures aren't provided, we'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.\n\nThe difference between 40 plumes and 4 plumes suggests a significant reduction. Assuming that the recombination causes the combined phage to have an average efficacy lower than the best of the two. If the best efficacy was 40, and the combined efficacy is 4, the average would be 4, which is 10x lower. So the recombination reduces the efficacy by a factor of 10.\n\nIf recombination reduces the efficacy by a factor of 10, this corresponds to a 90% reduction in the activity. In terms of plumes per million cells, if the normal plume density is high, say around 100,000 plumes per million, then a 90% reduction would lead to about 90,000 plumes. But in our case, when both are present, it's 4 plumes. That suggests that the combined effect is 4 plumes, which is much lower than the individual 40 plumes. This doesn't fit well with a simple reduction by a factor of 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages causes double induction, where P2 is induced by P1 on strain K. If P2 is induced, then adding P2 would increase the number of plumes beyond 40. But our data shows fewer plumes, so that's contradictory.\n\nAnother angle: If P1 and P2 recombine on strain B, leading to a lower plume count. Normally, P1 might cause 40 plumes, and P2 might cause 10 plumes. If they recombine, the combined phage might cause an average of (40 + 10)/2 = 25 plumes, but the data says only 4 plumes. That's a huge discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination creates a super-recombinant phage that has even lower plume density. For example, if P1 causes 40 plumes and P2 causes 10, then the combined phage might cause (40 * 10)/(40 + 10) \u2248 8.5 plumes. But the data shows 4 plumes, which is closer to a pure P1 effect. So this approach might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that P2 is being inhibited by P1 on strain B. So when both are present on strain B, P2 cannot cause any lysis, so the number of plumes equals that caused by P1 alone. Therefore, P1 is responsible for 4 plumes on strain B, and P2 is inhibited by P1.\n\nBut when P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes. Now, when P2 is added to the same plate, the number of plumes drops to 4. This suggests that P2 is interfering with P1's activity on strain K. Perhaps P2 is being induced by P1, but the data shows fewer plumes, which is inconsistent with induction. Unless P2 is being recombined with P1, but that would likely reduce the plume count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of P1 on strain K is causing some stress that P2 can't handle, leading to a decrease in plumes. This could happen if P2 is being induced by P1 on strain K, but in our data, adding P2 reduces the number of plumes, which would require induction, not inhibition.\n\nWait, maybe I've got this backwards. Let's clarify:\n\n- When P1 is present on strain K, it causes 40 plumes.\n- When both P1 and P2 are present on strain K, only 4 plumes are observed.\n- When P2 is present on strain B, it's inhibited by P1, leading to 4 plumes on strain B.\n- When both P1 and P2 are present on strain B, 4 plumes are observed.\n\nFrom this, it seems",

    "chunk_removed": "So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So if 40 were found on B, that means 40 phages were detected on strain B's lawn, indicating that the original phage was compatible with strain B.",
    "rollout": " So if 40 were found on B, that means 40 phages were detected on strain B's lawn, indicating that the original phage was compatible with strain B. Similarly, 4 were found on strain K, meaning the original phage wasn't compatible with strain K. \n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the T_4 genome is recombined between the two mutants. Recombination would occur when the two mutations interact, leading to cross-inhibition or interference in replication. If there's no recombination, the two mutations would be independent, and the probabilities would simply add up. However, with recombination, the occurrence of one mutation affects the probability of another, often through interference.\n\nIn the experiment, the higher dilution (1:10^5 for K) is expected to have fewer detectable events because the phage is less concentrated. If there's significant recombination, the number of detectable events might increase at lower concentrations compared to higher concentrations where independence holds. This is known as the 'double reciprocal' test. \n\nGiven that there are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio of K to B plumes is 1:10. This suggests that when the concentration is low enough to detect, the probability of a phage being compatible with K is 1/10th of that with B. In such cases, recombination would cause the detection rate to decrease more significantly than expected under independence. \n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can use the formula related to the double-reciprocal test. The formula is:\n\n(1/(a + 1)) * 100% = recombination frequency,\n\nwhere 'a' is the ratio of the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration. Here, the ratio is 1:10, so a is 10. Plugging in:\n\n(1/(10 + 1)) * 100% \u2248 9.09%.\n\nBut wait, this seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination fraction using the observed data. Since at lower concentrations (dilution 1:10^5), the number of plumes increases by a factor of 10, suggesting that the chance of a phage being compatible with K is 1/10th of B. That would imply a recombination frequency of 1 - (1/10)\u00b2 = 1 - 1/100 = 99%. That's way too high, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency 'f' can be estimated using the equation:\n\nf = (1 - sqrt(a)) / (1 + sqrt(a))),\n\nwhere 'a' is the ratio of the number of recombinants at the lower concentration. In this case, the ratio is 10 (since 40 is ten times 4). So,\n\nf = (1 - sqrt(10)) / (1 + sqrt(10))).\n\nCalculating sqrt(10) \u2248 3.162,\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3.162 \u2248 -2.162\n\nDenominator: 1 + 3.162 \u2248 4.162\n\nThus,\n\nf \u2248 (-2.162)/(4.162) \u2248 -0.521.\n\nWait, a negative recombination frequency doesn't make sense. Maybe I should take the absolute value. So approximately 0.521, which is about 52%. But none of the options go that high. The highest option is F (0.3%). Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plumes indicates the effectiveness of each phage. At low concentrations, if there's recombination, the effective compatibility decreases. The observed ratio is 4 vs. 40. So the effective probability of a phage being compatible with K is 40/100000 (plumes per gram) = 0.0004, while with B it's 4/100000 = 0.00004. The ratio is 10, which implies that the probability of recombination is such that when combined, the effective probability is 0.00004.\n\nIf f is the recombination frequency, then the effective probability P = p + f*(1-p). Here, p is the probability without recombination, which is 0.00004 (for B). So,\n\nP = 0.00004 + f*(1 - 0.00004)\n\nWe know P is 0.00004, so:\n\n0.00004 = 0.00004 + f*(0.99996)\n\nSubtracting 0.00004 from both sides:\n\n0 = f*0.99996 \u2192 f=0.\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Perhaps the correct formula is different. Another approach is to use the formula for the double reciprocal test:\n\nr = (m / n) - (n / m),\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of coincidence, m is the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration, and n is at the higher concentration.\n\nHere, m=4, n=40.\n\nr = (4/40) - (40/4) = 0.1 - 10 = -9.9.\n\nNegative coefficient of coincidence usually indicates lack of interference, but here it's quite high. The coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant pairs at lower conc) / (total possible pairs) - (number at higher conc) / (total possible pairs).\n\nTotal possible pairs = m * (m-1)/2 + n * (n-1)/2.\n\nAt lower conc: total possible pairs = 4*3/2 = 6.\n\nNumber of recombinant pairs = r * total possible pairs? Not sure. Alternatively, if r=-9.9, then:\n\nC = (4)/6 - (40)/((40)(39)/2) = (0.666...) - (40)/(780) \u2248 0.666 - 0.051 \u2248 0.615.\n\nThis is positive, so some interference exists. But I'm not sure how to relate this directly to recombination frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of coincidence relates to the degree of interference. For example, a high C indicates little interference, whereas a low C indicates significant interference.\n\nHowever, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a simpler approach. The problem states that the ratio of plumes at the lower concentration is 10:1 (40 vs. 4). This suggests that when the concentration is low enough to detect, the chance of a phage being compatible with strain K is 10 times lower than with B. Which would mean that the probability of recombination is such that the overall probability becomes 1/10th. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency:\n\np = (1 - sqrt(r)),\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of coincidence. Wait, earlier I had r = -9.9, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, let me recall that in the double reciprocal test, the coefficient of coincidence C is given by:\n\nC = (m1 * m2) / (n1 * n2),\n\nwhere m1, m2 are the number of recombinant events at each concentration, and n1, n2 are the numbers of non-recombinant events. But I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to realize that if the ratio of plumes is 10:1, the number of viable phages at the lower concentration is 10 times higher. This suggests that the chance of recombination is high. The formula for the recombination frequency 'f' can be approximated using the ratio of plumes.\n\nGiven that, if the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of being compatible, and knowing that the probability at the lower concentration is 1/10th of the higher, the recombination frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is f, then the probability that a phage is compatible with B is p_B, and with K is p_K = p_B * (1 - f).\n\nFrom the experiment, at low concentration, the number of plumes is 1/10th of what's seen at higher concentration. So,\n\np_K = p_B / 10.\n\nSince p_K = p_B * (1 - f), we can write:\n\np_B / 10 = p_B * (1 - f)\n\nDivide both sides by p_B (assuming p_B \u2260 0):\n\n1/10 = 1 - f\n\nThus,\n\nf = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 = 0.9.\n\nBut this is a very high recombination frequency, which isn't among the answer choices. The closest is H (5%), but that's still too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio. Maybe the actual ratio is 10:1, but the effect is that the probability of recombination is such that the effective probability is 1/10th. \n\nLet me consider that the presence of recombination reduces the effective probability. Suppose that normally, the probability of compatibility with B is p, and with K is q. Then, due to recombination, the effective probability at the lower concentration is p + f*(1 - p). At the lower concentration, we see that the effective probability is 1/10th of what it would be without recombination. Wait, no, the number of plumes is 10 times lower. So, the effective probability is 1/10th.\n\nTherefore,\n\np + f*(1 - p) = (p + (1 - p)*q)/10.\n\nBut without knowing p and q individually, this complicates things. Alternatively, assuming that the probability at the lower concentration is 1/10th of the higher, which suggests that recombination has reduced the probability by a factor of 10. Thus, f = 1 - (1/10)^2 = 1 - 1/100 = 0.99, which again is too high.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is f = 1 - (a), where a is the ratio of plumes. Here, a = 40/4 = 10. So f = 1 - 10 = -9, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, f = (ratio - 1), so 10 - 1 = 9, which is even higher. This seems contradictory.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to compute f directly, I should look for a standard method. From what I remember, the double reciprocal test uses the formula:\n\nR = (m/n) - (n/m),\n\nwhere m is the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration and n at the higher. Then, R is used to estimate the recombination frequency 'f' via R = 1/f - (1 - f).\n\nSolving for f:\n\nR = 1/f - 1 + f\n\nMultiply both sides by f:\n\nR*f = 1 - f + f^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nf^2 - (1 + R)f + 1 = 0\n\nPlugging in R = (4/40) - (40/4) = 0.1 - 10 = -9.9,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\nf^2 - (1 - 9.9)f + 1 = 0 \u2192 f^2 + 8.9f + 1 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = (8.9)^2 - 4*1*1 \u2248 79.21 - 4 = 75.21\n\nSolutions:\n\nf = [-8.9 \u00b1 sqrt(75.21)] / 2\n\nsqrt(75.21) \u2248 8.67\n\nSo,\n\nf = (-8.9 + 8.67)/2 \u2248 (-0.23)/2 \u2248 -0.115\n\nOr,\n\nf = (-8.9 - 8.67)/2 \u2248 -17.57/2 \u2248 -8.785\n\nBoth solutions are negative, which doesn't make sense for recombination frequency. This suggests that either the approach is incorrect or the data doesn't fit the model well. \n\nPerhaps instead of using the double reciprocal test, I should consider the concept of interference. Interference occurs when the occurrence of one mutation makes the occurrence of another less likely. Coefficient of coincidence C is used to quantify interference. High C indicates little interference, low C indicates significant interference.\n\nThe formula for C is:\n\nC = (m1*m2) / (n1*n2),\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the number of recombinant events at each concentration, and n1, n2 are the non-recombinant events.\n\nHere, m1 = 4, m2 = 40; n1 = 396,600 (since 100,000 - 4 = 99,996); n2 = 39,960 (100,000 - 40 = 99,960).\n\nWait, actually, n1 and n2 are the counts of non-recombinant events, so m1 = 4, n1 = 99,996; m2 = 40, n2 = 99,960.\n\nSo,\n\nC = (4*40) / (99,996*99,960) \u2248 160 / (10^9) \u2248 1.6e-7.\n\nThis is a very small coefficient of coincidence, indicating significant interference, which is consistent with the presence of recombination. \n\nNow, the coefficient of coincidence C is related to the recombination frequency 'f' by:\n\nC \u2248 (1 - f) * e^{-f},\n\nbut for small f, this approximates to:\n\nC \u2248 e^{-f} - f \u2248 1 - f - f \u2248 1 - 2f.\n\nSetting this equal to our computed C:\n\n1 - 2f \u2248 1.6e-7 \u2192 2f \u2248 1 - 1.6e-7 \u2192 f \u2248 0.5e-7.\n\nWhich is extremely small, around 0.00005%, which doesn't match any of the answer choices. This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption about the relationship between the plume counts and recombination frequency is flawed.\n\nAnother angle: considering that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, implying that the probability of recombination is such that the effective probability is 1/10th. If p is the probability of compatibility with B, then the probability with K is p*K. Given that K has 10x fewer plumes, perhaps p*K = p/10. Assuming p remains constant, this implies that K's probability is 1/10th, which could suggest a recombination frequency of 1 - (1/10)^2 = 0.99, but again, that's too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is 0.05% (option G), which is 0.0005.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if 40 were found on B, that means 40 phages were detected on strain B's lawn, indicating that the original phage was compatible with strain B. Similarly, 4 were found on strain K, meaning the original phage wasn't compatible with strain K. \n\nThe key here is to determine how much of the T_4 genome is recombined between the two mutants. Recombination would occur when the two mutations interact, leading to cross-inhibition or interference in replication. If there's no recombination, the two mutations would be independent, and the probabilities would simply add up. However, with recombination, the occurrence of one mutation affects the probability of another, often through interference.\n\nIn the experiment, the higher dilution (1:10^5 for K) is expected to have fewer detectable events because the phage is less concentrated. If there's significant recombination, the number of detectable events might increase at lower concentrations compared to higher concentrations where independence holds. This is known as the 'double reciprocal' test. \n\nGiven that there are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio of K to B plumes is 1:10. This suggests that when the concentration is low enough to detect, the probability of a phage being compatible with K is 1/10th of that with B. In such cases, recombination would cause the detection rate to decrease more significantly than expected under independence. \n\nTo find the percentage recombination, we can use the formula related to the double-reciprocal test. The formula is:\n\n(1/(a + 1)) * 100% = recombination frequency,\n\nwhere 'a' is the ratio of the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration. Here, the ratio is 1:10, so a is 10. Plugging in:\n\n(1/(10 + 1)) * 100% \u2248 9.09%.\n\nBut wait, this seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination fraction using the observed data. Since at lower concentrations (dilution 1:10^5), the number of plumes increases by a factor of 10, suggesting that the chance of a phage being compatible with K is 1/10th of B. That would imply a recombination frequency of 1 - (1/10)\u00b2 = 1 - 1/100 = 99%. That's way too high, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency 'f' can be estimated using the equation:\n\nf = (1 - sqrt(a)) / (1 + sqrt(a))),\n\nwhere 'a' is the ratio of the number of recombinants at the lower concentration. In this case, the ratio is 10 (since 40 is ten times 4). So,\n\nf = (1 - sqrt(10)) / (1 + sqrt(10))).\n\nCalculating sqrt(10) \u2248 3.162,\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3.162 \u2248 -2.162\n\nDenominator: 1 + 3.162 \u2248 4.162\n\nThus,\n\nf \u2248 (-2.162)/(4.162) \u2248 -0.521.\n\nWait, a negative recombination frequency doesn't make sense. Maybe I should take the absolute value. So approximately 0.521, which is about 52%. But none of the options go that high. The highest option is F (0.3%). Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plumes indicates the effectiveness of each phage. At low concentrations, if there's recombination, the effective compatibility decreases. The observed ratio is 4 vs. 40. So the effective probability of a phage being compatible with K is 40/100000 (plumes per gram) = 0.0004, while with B it's 4/100000 = 0.00004. The ratio is 10, which implies that the probability of recombination is such that when combined, the effective probability is 0.00004.\n\nIf f is the recombination frequency, then the effective probability P = p + f*(1-p). Here, p is the probability without recombination, which is 0.00004 (for B). So,\n\nP = 0.00004 + f*(1 - 0.00004)\n\nWe know P is 0.00004, so:\n\n0.00004 = 0.00004 + f*(0.99996)\n\nSubtracting 0.00004 from both sides:\n\n0 = f*0.99996 \u2192 f=0.\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Perhaps the correct formula is different. Another approach is to use the formula for the double reciprocal test:\n\nr = (m / n) - (n / m),\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of coincidence, m is the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration, and n is at the higher concentration.\n\nHere, m=4, n=40.\n\nr = (4/40) - (40/4) = 0.1 - 10 = -9.9.\n\nNegative coefficient of coincidence usually indicates lack of interference, but here it's quite high. The coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant pairs at lower conc) / (total possible pairs) - (number at higher conc) / (total possible pairs).\n\nTotal possible pairs = m * (m-1)/2 + n * (n-1)/2.\n\nAt lower conc: total possible pairs = 4*3/2 = 6.\n\nNumber of recombinant pairs = r * total possible pairs? Not sure. Alternatively, if r=-9.9, then:\n\nC = (4)/6 - (40)/((40)(39)/2) = (0.666...) - (40)/(780) \u2248 0.666 - 0.051 \u2248 0.615.\n\nThis is positive, so some interference exists. But I'm not sure how to relate this directly to recombination frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of coincidence relates to the degree of interference. For example, a high C indicates little interference, whereas a low C indicates significant interference.\n\nHowever, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a simpler approach. The problem states that the ratio of plumes at the lower concentration is 10:1 (40 vs. 4). This suggests that when the concentration is low enough to detect, the chance of a phage being compatible with strain K is 10 times lower than with B. Which would mean that the probability of recombination is such that the overall probability becomes 1/10th. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency:\n\np = (1 - sqrt(r)),\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of coincidence. Wait, earlier I had r = -9.9, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, let me recall that in the double reciprocal test, the coefficient of coincidence C is given by:\n\nC = (m1 * m2) / (n1 * n2),\n\nwhere m1, m2 are the number of recombinant events at each concentration, and n1, n2 are the numbers of non-recombinant events. But I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to realize that if the ratio of plumes is 10:1, the number of viable phages at the lower concentration is 10 times higher. This suggests that the chance of recombination is high. The formula for the recombination frequency 'f' can be approximated using the ratio of plumes.\n\nGiven that, if the number of plumes is proportional to the probability of being compatible, and knowing that the probability at the lower concentration is 1/10th of the higher, the recombination frequency can be calculated as follows:\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is f, then the probability that a phage is compatible with B is p_B, and with K is p_K = p_B * (1 - f).\n\nFrom the experiment, at low concentration, the number of plumes is 1/10th of what's seen at higher concentration. So,\n\np_K = p_B / 10.\n\nSince p_K = p_B * (1 - f), we can write:\n\np_B / 10 = p_B * (1 - f)\n\nDivide both sides by p_B (assuming p_B \u2260 0):\n\n1/10 = 1 - f\n\nThus,\n\nf = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 = 0.9.\n\nBut this is a very high recombination frequency, which isn't among the answer choices. The closest is H (5%), but that's still too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio. Maybe the actual ratio is 10:1, but the effect is that the probability of recombination is such that the effective probability is 1/10th. \n\nLet me consider that the presence of recombination reduces the effective probability. Suppose that normally, the probability of compatibility with B is p, and with K is q. Then, due to recombination, the effective probability at the lower concentration is p + f*(1 - p). At the lower concentration, we see that the effective probability is 1/10th of what it would be without recombination. Wait, no, the number of plumes is 10 times lower. So, the effective probability is 1/10th.\n\nTherefore,\n\np + f*(1 - p) = (p + (1 - p)*q)/10.\n\nBut without knowing p and q individually, this complicates things. Alternatively, assuming that the probability at the lower concentration is 1/10th of the higher, which suggests that recombination has reduced the probability by a factor of 10. Thus, f = 1 - (1/10)^2 = 1 - 1/100 = 0.99, which again is too high.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is f = 1 - (a), where a is the ratio of plumes. Here, a = 40/4 = 10. So f = 1 - 10 = -9, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, f = (ratio - 1), so 10 - 1 = 9, which is even higher. This seems contradictory.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to compute f directly, I should look for a standard method. From what I remember, the double reciprocal test uses the formula:\n\nR = (m/n) - (n/m),\n\nwhere m is the number of recombinant events at the lower concentration and n at the higher. Then, R is used to estimate the recombination frequency 'f' via R = 1/f - (1 - f).\n\nSolving for f:\n\nR = 1/f - 1 + f\n\nMultiply both sides by f:\n\nR*f = 1 - f + f^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nf^2 - (1 + R)f + 1 = 0\n\nPlugging in R = (4/40) - (40/4) = 0.1 - 10 = -9.9,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\nf^2 - (1 - 9.9)f + 1 = 0 \u2192 f^2 + 8.9f + 1 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = (8.9)^2 - 4*1*1 \u2248 79.21 - 4 = 75.21\n\nSolutions:\n\nf = [-8.9 \u00b1 sqrt(75.21)] / 2\n\nsqrt(75.21) \u2248 8.67\n\nSo,\n\nf = (-8.9 + 8.67)/2 \u2248 (-0.23)/2 \u2248 -0.115\n\nOr,\n\nf = (-8.9 - 8.67)/2 \u2248 -17.57/2 \u2248 -8.785\n\nBoth solutions are negative, which doesn't make sense for recombination frequency. This suggests that either the approach is incorrect or the data doesn't fit the model well. \n\nPerhaps instead of using the double reciprocal test, I should consider the concept of interference.

Since the lysogenic phage caused lysis in strain B, but not K, perhaps the recombination increased the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage against K. \n\nLooking at the numbers, after dilution, the proportion of successful infections depends on the number of plasmids. Dilution affects how many phages are present per cell. A higher dilution (1:10^5 vs. 1:10^7) means fewer phages per cell, making it harder for them to replicate beyond a certain point. However, the presence of both mutation types suggests that even with lower dilution, some replication happened. \n\nThe experiment shows that the lysogenic phage was able to cause issues against strain K, implying that its mutation allowed it to replicate effectively against strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage had a mutation that combined with another mutation from the lysogenic phage to become more effective against strain K. \n\nSo, to find the recombination rate, we can calculate how many times the two mutations could combine. In E. coli, when two phages multiply, they can form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) product if they recombine. The probability of recombination is influenced by selection pressure\u2014the presence of the target phage. In this case, the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is selected due to its ability to lyse strain B) may have favored recombination, allowing the mutated lysogenic phage to better replicate and infect K. \n\nThe formula to estimate recombination frequency (RF) is RF = (m + n)/(m + n + p), where m, n, p represent different outcomes. Alternatively, sometimes it's calculated using the ratio of successful replication events. But in this context, since we're dealing with plasmid replication and the effect on the growth of the bacterial lawn, the presence of both mutations allows the phage to spread further than expected without recombination. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage caused lysis in strain B but not K, and considering the difference in dilution factors, we can infer that the recombination increased the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage against strain K. To determine the exact percentage, we might look at the number of recombined plasmids versus non-recombined ones. However, the answer choices suggest relatively small percentages, so likely around 0.1% or similar. \n\nWait, looking back, the options include 0.05%, 0.02%, etc., down to 0.02%. Since the results involve differences in plating efficiency, maybe the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%. But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes relates inversely to the square root of the dilution factor. For example, with a dilution factor of 1:10^5, the number of plumes would scale as sqrt(1e5) \u2248 316. Similarly, for 1:10^7, it's about 316 * sqrt(10) \u2248 968. The observed plumes are 40 and 4, respectively. \n\nIf recombination increases the number of plumes, then the decrease in plumes compared to expectation would indicate the level of recombination. Using the formula for plasmid density, plasmid density \u221d sqrt(dilution factor). The ratio of plasmid densities is (sqrt(1e5) / sqrt(1e7)) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316. So, the plasmid density in the first sample is about 0.316 times that of the second. \n\nSince the number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages (and thus the number of plasmids), the ratio of plumes should also be approximately the same. The observed plumes are 40 and 4, which is a ratio of 10. That seems high, indicating significant recombination. However, this contradicts the initial thought that recombination might be low. Maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is selected due to its ability to lyse strain B) favors recombination, the recombination frequency could be estimated based on the increase in plasmid density. If the recombination leads to more efficient replication, the plasmids replicate faster, allowing more plasmids to exist, hence more plumes. \n\nBut given the limited data and the need to choose from the provided options, I think the correct answer is probably D. 0.1 percent.

But in this context, since we're dealing with plasmid replication and the effect on the growth of the bacterial lawn, the presence of both mutations allows the phage to spread further than expected without recombination. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage caused lysis in strain B but not K, and considering the difference in dilution factors, we can infer that the recombination increased the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage against strain K. To determine the exact percentage, we might look at the number of recombined plasmids versus non-recombined ones. However, the answer choices suggest relatively small percentages, so likely around 0.1% or similar. \n\nWait, looking back, the options include 0.05%, 0.02%, etc., down to 0.02%. Since the results involve differences in plating efficiency, maybe the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%. But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes relates inversely to the square root of the dilution factor. For example, with a dilution factor of 1:10^5, the number of plumes would scale as sqrt(1e5) \u2248 316. Similarly, for 1:10^7, it's about 316 * sqrt(10) \u2248 968. The observed plumes are 40 and 4, respectively. \n\nIf recombination increases the number of plumes, then the decrease in plumes compared to expectation would indicate the level of recombination. Using the formula for plasmid density, plasmid density \u221d sqrt(dilution factor). The ratio of plasmid densities is (sqrt(1e5) / sqrt(1e7)) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316. So, the plasmid density in the first sample is about 0.316 times that of the second. \n\nSince the number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages (and thus the number of plasmids), the ratio of plumes should also be approximately the same. The observed plumes are 40 and 4, which is a ratio of 10. That seems high, indicating significant recombination. However, this contradicts the initial thought that recombination might be low. Maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is selected due to its ability to lyse strain B) favors recombination, the recombination frequency could be estimated based on the increase in plasmid density. If the recombination leads to more efficient replication, the plasmids replicate faster, allowing more plasmids to exist, hence more plumes. \n\nBut given the limited data and the need to choose from the provided options, I think the correct answer is probably D. 0.1 percent. It aligns with the idea that recombination isn't very high.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event.",

    "rollout": " So if there are more plumes on B than K, maybe that indicates how much of each mutation was present.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the number of plumes relates to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If you have two independent mutations, the probability that both occur in a single phage is the product of their individual probabilities. So if mutation A occurs in frequency x and mutation B in y, then the combined occurrence would be xy. In the context of phages, each mutation leads to a certain plume count per daughter phage. But wait, perhaps it's better to think about the ratio of plumes observed. Since the phages are being plated on different backgrounds (strain B vs. strain K), the distribution will reflect the likelihood of each mutation occurring together versus separately.\n\nIn the first scenario, where the phage is plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phage (which has the mutation causing lysis) survives. So any plumes here would come from this type. When plated on strain K, which doesn't have this mutation, all plumes should come from either the lysogenic or wild-type phages. However, the presence of more plumes on B might indicate that the lysogenic phage is less common in the population, meaning fewer recombinant mutants are present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The formula for calculating the expected number of plumes in each group is based on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. For example, if the frequency of the lysogenic phage is p and the wild-type is q, then the expected number of plumes on strain B (where only lysogenic survives) would be p*(q + r), assuming r is another mutation, but since we're dealing with two mutations, maybe it's simpler. Alternatively, the number of plumes would depend on the interference between the two mutations, but without interference, the expectation would be pq for each strain.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the number of plumes observed on each background tells us about the recombination. If both mutations occur together in a phage, it's considered a recombinant, whereas if they occur independently, it's a new mutation. The ratio of plumes observed on the two backgrounds can help determine the degree of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the frequency of the lysogenic phage as p and the wild-type as q. The lysogenic phage carries the mutation that allows lysis, while the wild-type doesn\u2019t. When plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phage survives, so the number of plumes would be proportional to p*q (assuming no interference). Plated on strain K, the lysogenic phage still survives, but now also the wild-type can replicate. The number of plumes would be p*q + p*r, where r is the frequency of the wild-type mutation. However, since strain K lacks the lysogenic phage mutation, the wild-type can survive, leading to more plumes on K.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage may have a lower frequency because of the lytic division defect, which makes it less likely to replicate beyond the initial replication. So when plated on strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the only survivors are the lysogenic phages, resulting in a high number of plumes. When plated on strain K, the lysogenic phages replicate and divide, leading to more plumes than just those from the lysogenic phages alone.\n\nGiven that there are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage is somewhat limiting its ability to replicate further, hence fewer plumes on strain B. To calculate the recombination frequency, we consider the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the expected number of plumes on strain B is pq, and on strain K is p(q + r), but without interference, it's approximately pq/(p) = q, but that seems off. Maybe it's better to look at the ratio of plumes.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the number of plumes depends on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the two mutations are independent, the number of plumes on strain B (only lysogenic survives) is p*q. On strain K, the lysogenic can replicate and produce additional phages that replicate and divide, leading to p*q (from lysogenic) plus p*r (from wild-type). Assuming that the wild-type mutation is rare, r is small. Therefore, the total plumes on K would be roughly p*q + p*r \u2248 p*q(1 + r/p). But without knowing r, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, focusing solely on the ratio of plumes: 40 on B and 4 on K. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is 1/10 as frequent on K as it is on B. If p is the frequency of the lysogenic phage, then on B, the plumes are due to p*q, and on K, they are due to p*q + p*r. Assuming r is negligible compared to p*q, the plumes on K would be approximately p*q*(1 + r/p). If r is zero, plumes on K would equal plumes on B, but since they don't, plumes on B are higher. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can estimate it using the ratio of plumes. If the expected number of plumes on strain B is p*q and on strain K is p*q + p*r, and we know the ratio is 40:4, or 10:1, then:\n\np*q / (p*q + p*r) = 40/40 + 4 \u2192 40/44 \u2248 0.909\n\nAssuming r is very small, this simplifies to p*q / p*q \u2248 1, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, considering that plumes on B are due to p*q, and on K due to p*q + p*r, the ratio of plumes on B to K is (p*q)/(p*q + p*r) = q/(q + r). Given q=1, r=0. Then q/(q + r)=1, which contradicts the ratio of 10:1. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps instead, considering that the lysogenic phage has a lower replication rate because it causes lytic fission, which means it's less likely to replicate beyond the first few generations. So the frequency of the lysogenic phage is lower when plated on strain B. Let\u2019s say the frequency on B is p, and on K is p'. We want to find the recombination frequency, which is the product p*p'.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on B is 40 and on K is 4, and the ratio is 10:1, we can model this as follows:\n\nNumber of plumes on B = p * q = p * (frequency of wild-type)\nNumber of plumes on K = p * q + p * r = p * (q + r)\n\nBut without knowing r, this isn't directly solvable. Alternatively, considering that the plumes on B are due only to the lysogenic phage, and on K, they are due to both lysogenic and wild-type. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, implying that the contribution from the wild-type is 9 times less on K than on B.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a frequency p on B, then on K, it would be p' = p * e^{something}, but without interference, it's tricky. Another approach is to note that the number of plumes is inversely related to the square root of the product of the frequencies. So if the ratio of plumes is sqrt(p'/p) = sqrt(4/40) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316. This implies that p' = p * (1/10)^{0.5} \u2248 p * 0.316. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be p' * p = p^2 * (1/10)^{0.5}. Without knowing p, this isn't directly solvable.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler way is to recall that the number of recombinant plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, then the product of the frequencies is reduced by a factor of 10. Assuming that the wild-type mutation contributes equally, the frequency of the recombinant mutation must be such that p*q = 10*p*q', where q' is the frequency of the wild-type mutation on K. But without more information, this isn't straightforward.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., up to 0.5%. The correct answer is likely to be around 2% because the difference in plumes reflects the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the recombination frequency is low, like 2%, then the product p*q would be relatively small, explaining why the plumes are distributed differently between the two backgrounds.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
