If there was no recombination, then the lysogenic phage should be equally effective against both strains. However, here, when both are present, only 4 are found on K, whereas 40 are on B. Wait, that seems contradictory unless recombination occurred. Let me think again. If recombination happened, then the lysogenic phage might not integrate as efficiently into the T_4 genome, leading to less activity against certain strains. Or perhaps it's the opposite\u2014if one phage integrates into the T_4, it affects the other. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both phages leads to interference in the lysogenic activity. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this using the concept of interference or cross-reactivity. The fact that only part of the population shows issues suggests that the phage with the mutation in strain B doesn't replicate efficiently against strain K. This could happen due to recombination where the phage's DNA integrates into the T_4 genome in a way that affects its ability to replicate or infect. Recombination reduces the probability of successful replication, thereby reducing the number of plasmids. Since the same phage is being tested against two different strains, if it's integrated differently into the T_4 genome, its activity against one strain would be reduced compared to the other. To quantify this, I can use the formula for double reciprocal assay: (m x n)/(p + q + m x n). Wait, perhaps that's not exactly right. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of plasmids under normal conditions and compare it with what's observed. Normally, without any mutations, you'd expect a certain number of plasmids. When mutations occur, especially through recombination, the actual number changes. The ratio of plasmids between the two strains can indicate the degree of recombination. The formula used is typically (number of plasmids in strain B / number in strain K) = [ (a/(a+b)) / (c/(c+d)) ], but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the fraction of plasmids showing activity in each strain can help determine the level of recombination. For example, if recombination is high, the lysogenic phage might be less active against one strain, leading to fewer plasmids.

This suggests that the lysogenic phage is less effective against strain K than it is against strain B. If recombination occurred, perhaps the lysogenic phage becomes less effective against one strain. The exact calculation would involve determining the probabilities of integration and how they affect the phage's activity.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe main observation is that when both mutantphages are present, half of the population (the half that was treated with the lower dilution) resulted in more infections (40 vs. 4), while the other half didn't show as many issues (only 4). This might indicate that the combination of the two mutants leads to a higher probability of infection than either alone. But wait, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning that when mixed, perhaps the phages interact, causing more or less lytic activity. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutants increases the chance of lysogeny formation, leading to more lytic fission events, hence more colonies forming.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the recombination rate. Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic sequences within a phage or between different phages. In this case, the two mutations in T_4 phage would be part of the same genome segment, specifically in the rII region. Recombination occurs when parts of the DNA are exchanged between homologous regions. The degree of recombination determines whether the two mutations function independently (no recombination) or together (recombined).\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutants likely allows them to interact, potentially combining their effects. However, since only strain B showed damage when both mutants were present, it suggests that the combination caused a change in the phenotype that wasn't observed when either mutation alone was present. This could happen through recombination, where the two mutations interact and produce a new effect. \n\nThe key here is that when both mutants are present, the number of colonies formed is higher than expected from either mutation alone. Normally, without any interaction, each mutation would contribute to the infection rate separately. With recombination, the combined effect might lead to increased or decreased probabilities. In this case, having both mutants might cause some resistance (since only B shows damage) or vice versa, depending on the nature of the mutations. \n\nWait, no. The question says that both mutantphages are present. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, but the lytic phage does. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage should still affect strain B, right? But according to the experiment, only half of the bacteria showed damage when treated with both mutants. That seems contradictory unless there's another mechanism at play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants causes a decrease in the lytic activity of the lysogenic phage, making it harder to lyse the cell. Or maybe the combination leads to more efficient lysogeny formation, resulting in more resistant bacteria. But the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, half the bacteria are susceptible, whereas when only one type is present, all or most are susceptible.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose each mutation has its own independent probability of causing an issue. Without recombination, the total probability of being affected would be the sum of the probabilities minus the product (to account for overlap). If both mutations occur independently, the total probability P = p + q - pq, where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. If there's complete independence, P would be less than p+q. If there's complete recombination, then the two mutations are in such a way that their occurrence is dependent, leading to P = max(p, q) or something else.\n\nBut in our case, when both mutants are present, only a subset of the bacteria is affected. Specifically, 40% of the bacteria are affected, compared to 100% when only one type is present. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the initial statement said that when both are present, the E. coli strain B is \"divided\" into two halves. One half is treated with a higher dilution (1:1e7), and the other with a lower (1:1e5). Then, the treated halves are plated on strain B's lawn and K's lawn respectively. The counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Wait, that might be misinterpreted. Maybe the two halves are split, and one is treated with 1:1e7 and plated on B, giving 40 plumes, and the other half is treated with 1:1e5 and plated on K, giving 4 plumes. Or perhaps the treatment on K's side had a higher dilution, leading to more plumes. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that when both mutant types are present, half of the bacteria are effectively \"activated,\" meaning they've been exposed to enough phages to form some plasmids. The number of plumes depends on the number of activated cells. When plated on strain B's lawn, which has normal phage vectors, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of activated phages. Similarly, when plated on strain K, which may have different phage vectors, the same number applies. \n\nIf both mutant types are present, they might allow the activation of more phages, thus producing more plumes on each lawn. However, the experiment shows that when both are present, only 40 plumes are found on B, which is significantly less than the maximum possible. That suggests that the presence of both mutants reduces the number of activated cells, possibly due to some interference or competition between the two mutations. Alternatively, the combination might lead to reduced lytic activity, making the phages less effective, hence fewer plumes.\n\nBut the question is about the recombination rate between the two mutations. To find recombination, we need to determine whether the two mutations are in a region that can exchange genetic material. Recombination typically occurs when homologous regions are present. Since both mutations are on the same T_4 phage, recombination would involve exchanging segments of DNA within the same phage or between different phages. \n\nThe key here is that the presence of both mutations might suggest that they are in a region where recombination is occurring. The amount of recombination would depend on the likelihood of such exchanges happening. For example, if the two mutations are in a region that's 10^-6 or similar in length, the probability of recombination would be high. \n\nLooking back at the numbers, when both mutants are present, the number of plumes on each lawn is lower than when only one mutation is present. This suggests that the presence of both mutations is reducing the effectiveness of the phages, possibly through some form of interference or competition. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nAlternatively, consider that without recombination, the two mutations would act independently. If recombination occurs, the mutations might interfere with each other, either enhancing or inhibiting their effects. In this case, the presence of both mutants causes a loss of effect (more plumes on one lawn), suggesting that their combined action is disrupting the phage's ability to infect. This disruption could be due to recombination, where the two mutations influence each other's behavior, possibly leading to a situation where the phages cannot lyse the target bacteria as effectively.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we'd need to know the proportion of time or the probability that the two mutations occurred in close proximity, allowing for exchange. Assuming that the recombination frequency (rf) is the measure of how often the two mutations are present near each other, which is related to the probability of recombination. rf is usually given as a percentage, like 1%, 5%, etc. The exact calculation would require knowing the length of the region where recombination is measured and applying the Hardy-Weinberg formula.\n\nGiven the options provided, the choices range from 0.01% to 0.5%. These are very low percentages, indicating that the recombination rate is minimal. So the answer is likely option J, 0.01 percent, or option F, 0.3 percent.

This might indicate that the two mutants are interacting in a way that reduces the overall number of successful infections. If they were completely independent, perhaps both would cause full lysis, leading to a higher proportion of lytic events. However, in reality, when both are present, the outcome isn't as straightforward. The fact that only half are lyse-yielding suggests that the interaction is significant.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: four plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Plumes represent individual infections, right? So if we have a lot more plumes on B, that means more infections occurred despite the presence of both mutants. But why is there such a discrepancy? Maybe the dilution factors affect the probability differently. The first sample was diluted 1:1e7, so each bacterium has a much lower chance of being infected. The second sample was 1:1e5, so a higher chance. Since the result showed more infections on B, it implies that the higher dilution factor (more plating density) resulted in more infections, possibly due to the phages combining in a way that increases their effectiveness.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of plumes indicates the number of successful infections. More plumes mean more successful infections. So if B had more plumes (40 vs. 4), that suggests that under higher dilution conditions (since 1:1e5 is more plating than 1:1e7), there were more infections. That would mean that the higher dilution condition is where the phages have a better chance of infecting the cells. So the interaction must be happening in a way that increases the chance of infection when the phages are in high concentrations.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this from another angle. The experiment uses a plate method where the media is divided into two equal parts. Each part is then treated with a certain dilution factor before being plated on the respective bacterial strains. If the two strains interact, their combined effect might reduce the overall number of infections compared to having them independently.\n\nLet me consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Independent Phages**: If the two mutants were acting independently without any interaction, the expected outcome would depend on whether they lyse or lyse. In this case, strain B is mainly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is dominant, or vice versa. But if they're acting independently, the overall success rate would be determined by their individual probabilities. However, in reality, when both are present, the outcome isn't just additive; there's interference.\n\n2. **Recombinant Phages**: If the two mutants are recombined, their combined effect might either enhance or inhibit the infectivity depending on the nature of the recombination. For instance, if they form a new prophage that integrates into the host genome, it might have different effects. However, in this context, the recombination likely affects the ability of the phages to infect the host cells effectively.\n\nGiven the results, the majority of the bacteria are lyse-yielding (B) even though both mutants are present. This suggests that the interaction between the two mutants is reducing the likelihood of full infection. Perhaps the phages interfere with each other's activity, making it harder for both to fully lyse the host cells.\n\nTo quantify the recombination, I think the concept of \"co-infection\" comes into play. Recombination between two genes typically leads to a change in the fitness effect of the genotype. In phage terms, if the two mutants are recombining, their combination might produce a phage that has a different lysogenicity versus lytic properties. The recombination frequency (RF) is often measured using statistical methods like the chi-squared test, but I don't recall the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the ratio of plasmids in the two samples could reflect the degree of interaction. The first sample (1:1e7) is less dense, so fewer plasmids, while the second (1:1e5) is more dense, allowing more plasmids to infect. The result showing more infections on B might suggest that the higher density allows for more phages to infect, potentially indicating a stronger interaction.\n\nBut I'm still unsure how to directly calculate the recombination percentage from this information. Maybe I need to use the formula for calculating the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to the occurrence of two independent events. The coefficient of coincidence C is given by:\n\nC = (number of observed coincidences) / (expected number of coincidences)\n\nExpected number of coincidences = (n1 * n2) / N\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the numbers of phages in each sample, and N is the total number of phages.\n\nIn our case, n1 = 1e7 and n2 = 1e5, so expected coincidences would be (1e7 * 1e5) / N, but N is the sum of both samples. Wait, actually, N is the total number of cells plated. Each sample is divided equally, so N is twice the number of cells in one sample.\n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating things. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence measures how often two events occur together relative to what would be expected if they were independent. If the coefficient is greater than 1, it suggests positive association (recombination), while less than 1 suggests negative association.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual counts or the number of plasmids, I might not be able to apply this correctly. Maybe instead, the problem is simpler, expecting a direct calculation based on the number of plumes observed.\n\nLooking back, the first sample has 4 plumes, and the second has 40. The dilutions are 1:1e7 and 1:1e5, respectively. The ratio of plumes could relate to the product of the dilution factors. Because the first dilution has a lower chance of infection, and the second has a higher chance, the number of plumes would increase accordingly. If the recombination is occurring, it might influence the effective dilution factor.\n\nWait, the ratio of plumes could be related to the inverse of the dilution factors. So plume count P1 : P2 = (1/dilution1) : (1/dilution2). Here, P1/P2 = (1/1e7)/(1/1e5) = 1e5 / 1e7 = 1/100. So P1 : P2 = 1 : 100. But in our case, P1 is 4 and P2 is 40, so 4:40 simplifies to 1:10, which is close to 1:100. Hmm, that suggests that the ratio matches approximately, which supports the idea that the recombination is happening.\n\nIf the recombination is affecting the probability of infection, the number of plumes observed would increase. The expected number of plumes without recombination would be proportional to the product of the dilution factors. Without recombination, the expected plume count would be N1 * N2 / N_total, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of coincidence could help determine the degree of recombination. The formula is C = (observed) / (expected). If C > 1, it suggests positive association (recombination).\n\nSo let's compute C:\n\nC = 40 / [(1e7 * 1e5) / (2*1e6)] \u2192 Wait, I'm not sure about the denominator. Actually, the expected number of coincidences is (n1 * n2) / N, where N is the total number of cells. Assuming that each sample has the same number of cells, say N/2 each.\n\nThen, expected coincidences = (N/2 * N/2) / N = N\u00b2/(4N) = N/4.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of plumes reflects the ratio of recombination frequencies.\n\nIf the recombination frequency (rf) is r, then the coefficient of coincidence C can be approximated as:\n\nC \u2248 rf + (1 - rf) * (p/q)\n\nwhere p and q are the probabilities of infection in each sample. But without knowing p and q, this might not work.\n\nAnother approach: the number of plumes on each sample is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So the plume density on B is 4, and on K is 40. Since dilution factor B is 1e7 and K is 1e5, the plume density is roughly 10 times higher on B. This suggests that the interaction is strong enough to allow more infections on B, which aligns with the observation that only half the bacteria are lyse-yielding.\n\nPutting this all together, the recombination frequency must be quite high. Looking at the options provided, the highest is 0.05%, followed by 0.02%. Given that the plume densities increased significantly from B (4) to K (40), which is a tenfold increase, it suggests a substantial degree of recombination, probably above 1%.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the closest answer is F. 0.3 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nThe key here is that when both types are present, the result is half being affected (lysed) and half not (lytic). This suggests that the interactions between the two mutants might be causing the difference in outcome. In phage genetics, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages. So if the two mutants share a common gene (like a promoter), their combination could lead to different outcomes when they infect the host. For example, in the case of the lysogenic and lytic phages, their presence together might cause interference in their infectivity.\n\nIn the experiment, the result shows that only half the bacteria are affected, meaning that both phages aren't leading to full infection in all cases.

    "rollout": " The initial result was that when both are present, half the bacteria are lysed, and the other half aren't. But then they split further: half is more concentrated (diluted 1e7), so less likely to be infected, leading to fewer plumes on K (since K is another strain). Wait, no, actually, when they plate on strain B's lawn, the half that's more dilute would have higher concentration, meaning more phages are present. So more phages should lead to more infections, but only the lysogenic phage would cause problems. Similarly, the other half is more concentrated (diluted 1e5), meaning even more phages, but perhaps less susceptible? Or maybe some combination occurs where the phages interfere with each other. \n\nThe key point here is that the number of plumes on K (the second half) is significantly higher than expected from just the lysogenic phage. Normally, without any recombination, the lysogenic phage alone would lyse some E. coli, but in this case, adding a different phage type seems to increase the effect. Since the first half (diluted 1e7) has fewer plumes, it's likely that this group has lower concentrations of phages, allowing more to lyse. However, the second half (diluted 1e5) has higher concentrations, leading to more plumes. This suggests that the recombination increases the probability of phage activity, as the presence of a recombined phage might interact differently with the target bacteria. \n\nThe formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination is often used in genetic experiments. It's something like (recombinant frequency) = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). In this context, the \"offspring\" could represent the outcomes of the phage infection events. If we consider that the lysogenic phage alone caused half the bacteria to lyse, but when combined, the number of plumes increased, indicating that the new phage type contributes to the lyse process. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions determining the recombination amount, which refers to the percentage of homologous recombination. Recombination rate is calculated using the formula: R = (number of recombinant individuals - number of non-recombinants)/total number of individuals. However, in phage experiments, sometimes the approach is to estimate the probability of recombination occurring at a specific site, which can be done by looking at the distribution of the resulting mutations. For example, in the T4 phage, mutations occur either in the transgene (T4a) or in the transgene plus the mutated gene (T4b), depending on whether there was recombination. \n\nIn this scenario, the two types of mutants are probably T4a and T4b, where T4b includes a mutation in the transgene. The presence of the lysogenic phage (T4b) would lyse the bacteria, while the wild-type phage (T4a) wouldn't. However, when both types are present, their combinations might lead to increased susceptibility. \n\nThe experiment shows that when only T4b is present, half the bacteria are lysed (as expected). When both T4a and T4b are present, more bacteria are lysed, specifically 40% compared to the original 25%. Wait, actually, the description says that when the first half (diluted 1e7) is plated on strain B's lawn, the other half is plated on strain K's lawn. The results were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, but the wording is a bit confusing. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the first half (diluted 1e7) is treated on strain B's lawn, and the second half (diluted 1e5) is treated on strain K's lawn. Then, in the first half, only the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) would lyse some of the E. coli, while the wild-type phage would not. The second half, when treated on strain K, would show more plumes because the phages are more concentrated. \n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you plate the phages on the E. coli, the number of phages affects the outcome. Dilution factor determines how many cells are plated. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of each phage causing an infection is lower. Conversely, a lower dilution factor means more cells are plated, increasing the chance of multiple infections. \n\nSo, in the first part, the phages are diluted 1e7 (so few cells are plated), and then the bacteria are plated on strain B. The second part, the same phages are diluted 1e5 (more cells plated), and then the bacteria are plated on strain K. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage (let's say it's Type X) causes lysis, it would lyse some cells. If the wild-type phage (Type Y) doesn't lyse, it would die. Now, when you mix both, Type X and Type Y, the phages may interact. If there's recombination, the combination might lyse differently. \n\nIn the initial experiment, when only Type X is present, half the E. coli are lysed. That makes sense because Type X would lyse some of them. When both Type X and Type Y are present, more E. coli are lysed. Specifically, 40% on strain B and 4% on strain K. Wait, that doesn't add up. The description says four plumes on K and 40 on B. Each plume represents an infection event. So if you plate 1e5 cells (more cells) on strain B, you expect more infections, hence more plumes. Similarly, on strain K, 1e7 cells would give more plumes. \n\nBut the actual counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. So on strain B, which had higher dilution factor (1e7), you see fewer plumes (4 vs. 40 on K). That suggests that the combination of both types led to more infections, implying that some kind of interaction occurred. \n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T4 phage. Recombination typically refers to changes in the DNA sequence due to recombination events. In this context, the T4 phage has a transgene where mutations can occur. The lysogenic phage has a transgene plus a mutation (T4b), while the wild-type phage has only the transgene (T4a). Recombination would involve a change in the transgene sequence, such as swapping a segment. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, you might use the formula: R = (number of recombinant individuals - number of non-recombinants)/total. However, in phage experiments, it's often determined by observing the difference in plating efficiency or the distribution of mutations. Alternatively, the fraction of recombinant phages can indicate the degree of recombination. \n\nAnother approach is to look at the ratio of lysogeny in the mixture. If both types of phages lyse the same number of cells, their combination would lyse twice as many. But here, the result was 40% on B and 4% on K. That's a 10-fold difference, suggesting some interaction. \n\nSince the initial result was that only the lysogenic phage (Type X) causes lysis, and when combined with Type Y, more infections occur, it implies that Type Y interacts with Type X. If recombination occurs, the combination might lyse cells differently. \n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the proportion of each type of phage. If the phages are equally represented, the probability of recombination would depend on how much the mutation affects the lysogenic fission. However, given that the experiment resulted in more infections when both types are present, the recombination must contribute to increased susceptibility. \n\nAssuming that the recombination leads to increased susceptibility, and knowing that the ratio of lysing cells depends on the product of the fractions of each phage type, we can set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency. If both types are present in equal amounts, the total fraction of lysogenic phages would be (1 + r)/2, assuming r is the proportion of recombined phages. \n\nHowever, in phage experiments, the observed distribution often indicates the presence of recombination. The formula to determine the likelihood of recombination is based on the ratio of plasmid frequencies. If the plasmids are more likely to lyse when recombined, the recombination rate would be higher. \n\nGiven the data, the number of plumes on K is much lower than on B, indicating that the combination of phages is more effective. This suggests that the combination leads to increased lysing, possibly due to recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can compare the expected number of plumes under normal conditions (only one type) versus the observed. \n\nUnder normal conditions, only one type (say, Type X) would lyse cells. When combined with another type (Type Y), the fraction of lysing cells would increase. The observed increase suggests that recombination has occurred. The recombination frequency can be estimated by comparing the observed plumes to the expected ones. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 + r)/2, assuming both types are present equally. However, in this case, the number of plumes on K is much lower, suggesting that the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of the combined phages. Therefore, the recombination must have reduced the likelihood of lysing, implying that recombination decreased the fraction of lysogenic phages. \n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of lysing cells, the presence of recombination would create a situation where the product of the fractions of each phage type is higher, leading to more lysing. Given that the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40, the ratio is 1:10. Assuming that recombination decreases the lysing efficiency, the ratio of lysing cells would reflect the change due to recombination. \n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, all lysogenic phages (Type X) would lyse cells, giving a certain number of plumes. With recombination, some of the lysogenic phages become wild-type (Type Y), reducing the number of lysing phages. The ratio of lysing cells becomes (Y * (1 - r)) / (X * (1 + r)), assuming recombination affects the lysogenic fission. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Instead, I'll recall a simpler approach: when two types of phages are mixed, the number of lysing cells is approximately the sum of the products of their frequencies. If there's complete recombination, the number of lysing cells would decrease because some phages lose their lysogenic property. \n\nGiven the counts of plumes, we can infer the relative contributions. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. This suggests that the combination of both types caused 40% of the cells to lyse, whereas only Type X alone caused 25% (assuming equal representation). Thus, the addition of Type Y decreased the lysing efficiency by a factor of 4. \n\nThis decrease can be attributed to recombination. The reduction in lysing efficiency can be modeled as (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. If the combined effect reduces the lysing by a factor of 4, then (1 - r) = 1/4, so r = 0.75.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The initial result was that when both are present, half the bacteria are lysed, and the other half aren't. But then they split further: half is more concentrated (diluted 1e7), so less likely to be infected, leading to fewer plumes on K (since K is another strain). Wait, no, actually, when they plate on strain B's lawn, the half that's more dilute would have higher concentration, meaning more phages are present. So more phages should lead to more infections, but only the lysogenic phage would cause problems. Similarly, the other half is more concentrated (diluted 1e5), meaning even more phages, but perhaps less susceptible? Or maybe some combination occurs where the phages interfere with each other. \n\nThe key point here is that the number of plumes on K (the second half) is significantly higher than expected from just the lysogenic phage. Normally, without any recombination, the lysogenic phage alone would lyse some E. coli, but in this case, adding a different phage type seems to increase the effect. Since the first half (diluted 1e7) has fewer plumes, it's likely that this group has lower concentrations of phages, allowing more to lyse. However, the second half (diluted 1e5) has higher concentrations, leading to more plumes. This suggests that the recombination increases the probability of phage activity, as the presence of a recombined phage might interact differently with the target bacteria. \n\nThe formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination is often used in genetic experiments. It's something like (recombinant frequency) = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). In this context, the \"offspring\" could represent the outcomes of the phage infection events. If we consider that the lysogenic phage alone caused half the bacteria to lyse, but when combined, the number of plumes increased, indicating that the new phage type contributes to the lyse process. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions determining the recombination amount, which refers to the percentage of homologous recombination. Recombination rate is calculated using the formula: R = (number of recombinant individuals - number of non-recombinants)/total number of individuals. However, in phage experiments, sometimes the approach is to estimate the probability of recombination occurring at a specific site, which can be done by looking at the distribution of the resulting mutations. For example, in the T4 phage, mutations occur either in the transgene (T4a) or in the transgene plus the mutated gene (T4b), depending on whether there was recombination. \n\nIn this scenario, the two types of mutants are probably T4a and T4b, where T4b includes a mutation in the transgene. The presence of the lysogenic phage (T4b) would lyse the bacteria, while the wild-type phage (T4a) wouldn't. However, when both types are present, their combinations might lead to increased susceptibility. \n\nThe experiment shows that when only T4b is present, half the bacteria are lysed (as expected). When both T4a and T4b are present, more bacteria are lysed, specifically 40% compared to the original 25%. Wait, actually, the description says that when the first half (diluted 1e7) is plated on strain B's lawn, the other half is plated on strain K's lawn. The results were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, but the wording is a bit confusing. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the first half (diluted 1e7) is treated on strain B's lawn, and the second half (diluted 1e5) is treated on strain K's lawn. Then, in the first half, only the lysogenic phage (which causes lysis) would lyse some of the E. coli, while the wild-type phage would not. The second half, when treated on strain K, would show more plumes because the phages are more concentrated. \n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you plate the phages on the E. coli, the number of phages affects the outcome. Dilution factor determines how many cells are plated. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of each phage causing an infection is lower. Conversely, a lower dilution factor means more cells are plated, increasing the chance of multiple infections. \n\nSo, in the first part, the phages are diluted 1e7 (so few cells are plated), and then the bacteria are plated on strain B. The second part, the same phages are diluted 1e5 (more cells plated), and then the bacteria are plated on strain K. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage (let's say it's Type X) causes lysis, it would lyse some cells. If the wild-type phage (Type Y) doesn't lyse, it would die. Now, when you mix both, Type X and Type Y, the phages may interact. If there's recombination, the combination might lyse differently. \n\nIn the initial experiment, when only Type X is present, half the E. coli are lysed. That makes sense because Type X would lyse some of them. When both Type X and Type Y are present, more E. coli are lysed. Specifically, 40% on strain B and 4% on strain K. Wait, that doesn't add up. The description says four plumes on K and 40 on B. Each plume represents an infection event. So if you plate 1e5 cells (more cells) on strain B, you expect more infections, hence more plumes. Similarly, on strain K, 1e7 cells would give more plumes. \n\nBut the actual counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. So on strain B, which had higher dilution factor (1e7), you see fewer plumes (4 vs. 40 on K). That suggests that the combination of both types led to more infections, implying that some kind of interaction occurred. \n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T4 phage. Recombination typically refers to changes in the DNA sequence due to recombination events. In this context, the T4 phage has a transgene where mutations can occur. The lysogenic phage has a transgene plus a mutation (T4b), while the wild-type phage has only the transgene (T4a). Recombination would involve a change in the transgene sequence, such as swapping a segment. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, you might use the formula: R = (number of recombinant individuals - number of non-recombinants)/total. However, in phage experiments, it's often determined by observing the difference in plating efficiency or the distribution of mutations. Alternatively, the fraction of recombinant phages can indicate the degree of recombination. \n\nAnother approach is to look at the ratio of lysogeny in the mixture. If both types of phages lyse the same number of cells, their combination would lyse twice as many. But here, the result was 40% on B and 4% on K. That's a 10-fold difference, suggesting some interaction. \n\nSince the initial result was that only the lysogenic phage (Type X) causes lysis, and when combined with Type Y, more infections occur, it implies that Type Y interacts with Type X. If recombination occurs, the combination might lyse cells differently. \n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the proportion of each type of phage. If the phages are equally represented, the probability of recombination would depend on how much the mutation affects the lysogenic fission. However, given that the experiment resulted in more infections when both types are present, the recombination must contribute to increased susceptibility. \n\nAssuming that the recombination leads to increased susceptibility, and knowing that the ratio of lysing cells depends on the product of the fractions of each phage type, we can set up an equation. Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency. If both types are present in equal amounts, the total fraction of lysogenic phages would be (1 + r)/2, assuming r is the proportion of recombined phages. \n\nHowever, in phage experiments, the observed distribution often indicates the presence of recombination. The formula to determine the likelihood of recombination is based on the ratio of plasmid frequencies. If the plasmids are more likely to lyse when recombined, the recombination rate would be higher. \n\nGiven the data, the number of plumes on K is much lower than on B, indicating that the combination of phages is more effective. This suggests that the combination leads to increased lysing, possibly due to recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can compare the expected number of plumes under normal conditions (only one type) versus the observed. \n\nUnder normal conditions, only one type (say, Type X) would lyse cells. When combined with another type (Type Y), the fraction of lysing cells would increase. The observed increase suggests that recombination has occurred. The recombination frequency can be estimated by comparing the observed plumes to the expected ones. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (1 + r)/2, assuming both types are present equally. However, in this case, the number of plumes on K is much lower, suggesting that the presence of recombination reduces the effectiveness of the combined phages. Therefore, the recombination must have reduced the likelihood of lysing, implying that recombination decreased the fraction of lysogenic phages. \n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of lysing cells, the presence of recombination would create a situation where the product of the fractions of each phage type is higher, leading to more lysing. Given that the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40, the ratio is 1:10. Assuming that recombination decreases the lysing efficiency, the ratio of lysing cells would reflect the change due to recombination. \n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, all lysogenic phages (Type X) would lyse cells, giving a certain number of plumes. With recombination, some of the lysogenic phages become wild-type (Type Y), reducing the number of lysing phages. The ratio of lysing cells becomes (Y * (1 - r)) / (X * (1 + r)), assuming recombination affects the lysogenic fission. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Instead, I'll recall a simpler approach: when two types of phages are mixed, the number of lysing cells is approximately the sum of the products of their frequencies. If there's complete recombination, the number of lysing cells would decrease because some phages lose their lysogenic property. \n\nGiven the counts of plumes, we can infer the relative contributions. On strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. This suggests that the combination of both types caused 40% of the cells to lyse, whereas only Type X alone caused 25% (assuming equal representation). Thus, the addition of Type Y decreased the lysing efficiency by a factor of 4. \n\nThis decrease can be attributed to recombination. The reduction in lysing efficiency can be modeled as (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency. If the combined effect reduces the lysing by a factor of 4, then (1 - r) = 1/4, so r = 0.75. However, this assumes linear effects, which might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency, but this is speculative. \n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is C. 1.5 percent, but I'm not entirely confident.

That's odd because the lysogenic phage shouldn't affect strain K. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results.

Or maybe the presence of both types leads to some kind of interaction where the lysogenic phage somehow affects strain K, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both types allows for some mechanism that causes the lysogenic phage to have an effect on strain K, but that's not typical. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The key information is that when both types are present, only strain K is affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage didn't do anything to strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage and the T_4 phage are compatible, meaning that their mutations don't interfere. However, the fact that when both are present, strain B is mostly affected (with 40 plumes) compared to the half on strain K (4 plumes) indicates that the lysogenic phage is somehow dominant here, but that contradicts my previous thought. \n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the experiment. It's stated as: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Then four plumes are found on K, and 40 on B. So, in total, the number of plumes depends on the number of phages that successfully infected the cells. If the half on strain B has 4 plumes, that means 4 phages successfully infected B. Similarly, the half on strain K has 40 plumes, meaning 40 phages successfully infected K. \n\nNow, considering that both types are present, it's possible that some of the phages from both types interact. For example, if the lysogenic phage (Type X) is able to infect strain K (Type Y), it might lead to some disruption, making strain K be affected. However, normally, lysogenic phages should not lyse E. coli, so they shouldn't affect strain K unless there's a specific condition or mutation. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both types allows for some recombination where the lysogenic phage integrates its mutation into the T_4 genome, creating a recombinant phage that could affect strain K. \n\nIf that's the case, the number of plumes on strain K (40) compared to strain B (4) suggests a high degree of recombination. Since strain K is more affected, and assuming that the lysogenic phage integrated its mutation into the T_4 genome, the likelihood increases. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of successful infections, which correlates with the number of phages that have successfully integrated their mutations. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nIn this case, the number of recombinant individuals would correspond to the number of phages that integrated their mutations affecting strain K. Since strain K is more affected, and assuming that the presence of both types leads to more integration, the number of recombinants would be significant. \n\nGiven the numbers: 40 plumes on K vs. 4 on B, the ratio is 10 times higher. Assuming that the recombination frequency is directly related to the ratio of affected strains, a 10x difference could suggest a high level of recombination. Typically, a 1% recombination frequency corresponds to a 99% success rate, which would mean that 99% of the phages have integrated their mutations, resulting in very few non-integrated ones. However, in this case, 40 out of 404 (since 40 + 364 = 404?) might not fit neatly. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the proportion of recombinants relative to the total number of phages. \n\nAnother approach is to model the expected number of recombinants. If x is the recombination frequency (as a fraction), then the probability that a phage integrates a mutation is x. Therefore, the expected number of recombinants in the population would be proportional to x. Given that strain K is more affected, the number of recombinants is higher, indicating a higher x. \n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1. If we assume that all phages have a certain mutation rate, and the presence of both types leads to some integration, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that only a small fraction of the phages have integrated their mutations. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the ratio of plumes. If strain K is more affected, the number of recombinants is higher. The ratio is 40/4 = 10. So, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1%, which is option A. Because a 1% recombination frequency would mean that 99% of the phages are non-recombinant, and 1% are recombinant. In that case, the number of recombinants would be much smaller compared to the non-recombinants. But in our case, strain K is more affected, so the majority are recombinants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinants. If there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the total number of phages is roughly 404 (4 + 400?). Then, the proportion of recombinants is 40/404 \u2248 0.099 or 9.9%. So that's approximately 1%. That aligns with option A. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Typically, a 1% recombination frequency corresponds to a 99% success rate, which would mean that 99% of the phages have integrated their mutations, resulting in very few non-integrated ones. However, in this case, 40 out of 404 (since 40 + 364 = 404?) might not fit neatly. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the proportion of recombinants relative to the total number of phages. \n\nAnother approach is to model the expected number of recombinants. If x is the recombination frequency (as a fraction), then the probability that a phage integrates a mutation is x. Therefore, the expected number of recombinants in the population would be proportional to x. Given that strain K is more affected, the number of recombinants is higher, indicating a higher x. \n\nGiven that there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10:1. If we assume that all phages have a certain mutation rate, and the presence of both types leads to some integration, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that only a small fraction of the phages have integrated their mutations. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the ratio of plumes. If strain K is more affected, the number of recombinants is higher. The ratio is 40/4 = 10. So, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1%, which is option A. Because a 1% recombination frequency would mean that 99% of the phages are non-recombinant, and 1% are recombinant. In that case, the number of recombinants would be much smaller compared to the non-recombinants. But in our case, strain K is more affected, so the majority are recombinants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the number of recombinants. If there are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the total number of phages is roughly 404 (4 + 400?). Then, the proportion of recombinants is 40/404 \u2248 0.099 or 9.9%. So that's approximately 1%. That aligns with option A. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",

    "rollout": " In the first case, where only lysogenic phages are present, all should die off because they don't lyse the cell. But in reality, the E. coli strain B isn't completely cleared; instead, half is cleared, then further treated with different dilutions. That probably indicates that some of the phages didn't interact properly and died off.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the key point is that when both types are present, the effect depends on whether they interfere with each other. Since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause lytic fission) affects strain B, but the lytic phage (which does) doesn't affect strain B. So why did strain B not get cleared? Maybe because the presence of the lysogenic phage caused some change in the lysogenic phage itself, leading to more activity. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate better into the host genome, causing more efficient replication and thus more lytic fission events. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might be under an antibiotic stress, like the presence of an inducer like ciprofloxacin, which would allow the lysogenic phage to replicate despite being less active.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half of the E. coli is cleared, then further treatment with different dilutions. Then, when both types are present, only half is cleared, then treated at 1:1e7, resulting in 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, wait, the number of plumes seems low. Normally, the number of plumes expected without any interference would be around sqrt(N), where N is the total number of phages. But here, we're seeing multiple plumes on each strain, which suggests that some phages are infecting both strains. This could happen if the two mutations interfere with each other, causing some phages to have both mutations. Alternatively, the presence of the lysogenic phage might interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to lyse, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me approach this methodically. The key points from the problem:\n\n- Two types of mutantphages: lysogenic (causes lysogenic fission) and non-lytic (lytic).\n- Infection of E. coli strain B: only the lysogenic phage causes death.\n- When both are present, the E. coli strain B is partially cleared, suggesting that some phages survived both.\n- After clearing, the first half was treated with 1:1e7 and placed on strain B's lawn, resulting in 4 plumes.\n- The second half was treated with 1:1e5 and placed on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes.\n- Total plumes on K: 4 + 40 = 44?\nWait, no, the user says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So each half is treated separately. So half is 4 plumes on B's lawn, and the other half is 40 plumes on K's lawn. So total plumes on K: 40.\n\nSimilarly, the first half is 4 plumes on B's lawn, and the second half is 40 on K's lawn. Wait, no, the way it's written is \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" And \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Hmm, I'm confused now. Maybe I misread it.\n\nLet me parse the original problem again:\n\n\"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nWait, no, correction: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" No, that's not correct. It says: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" Wait, that can't be right because both would require the same dilution. Maybe it's a typo, and one is 1:1e5 and the other is 1:1e7. Let me assume that one is 1:1e5 and the other is 1:1e7. But the initial description said \"plated on strain B\" and \"strain K\", so probably the dilutions are different.\n\nSo, half of the population is treated as follows:\n\nHalf is 4 plumes on strain B's lawn (since they used 1:1e7 and saw 4 plumes).\n\nHalf is 40 plumes on strain K's lawn (since they used 1:1e5 and saw 40 plumes).\n\nTotal plumes: 4 (on B) + 40 (on K) = 44?\n\nBut the question is asking about the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two mutations. The presence of double mutants (both mutations) suggests that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination. The number of double mutants observed is important in determining the level of recombination.\n\nIn experiments with recombinant DNA, the number of recombinant fragments (double mutants) is proportional to the square of the number of crossing-over events. However, in this case, it's a bit different because it's a bacterial experiment. The formula for estimating crossover frequency (recombination rate) is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (number of double mutants / total number of possible combinations)\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent, the maximum number of double mutants would be 4 (two possibilities: mutation A followed by mutation B, and mutation B followed by mutation A). Here, we observe 40 double mutants on strain K and 4 on strain B.\n\nBut wait, the data given is confusing. Let's clarify:\n\nAfter treating the first half (with 1:1e7 dilution) with strain B's lawn, 4 plumes appeared. Similarly, the other half was treated with 1:1e5 dilution with strain K, yielding 40 plumes.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of double mutants, then:\n\nFor strain B: 4 double mutants (both mutations present)\nFor strain K: 40 double mutants\n\nBut the total number of possible double mutants is limited by the number of possible interactions. Since there are two mutations, the maximum possible double mutants would be 4 (AB and BA). However, in reality, it's often assumed that AB and BA are identical, so the maximum is 2 (if considering AB as double mutant). But the numbers here suggest a high recombination rate because 40 double mutants on K and 4 on B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of each type of double mutant. Let's consider that the recombination frequency can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIf R is the recombination frequency,\n\nR = (number of double mutants) / (total number of possible double mutants)\n\nAssuming that the mutations are linked, the number of possible double mutants is 2 (AB and BA). But sometimes, especially in experiments, the number of double mutants observed is considered as the count of each type. For example, if you have four double mutants, it could be either AB or BA, depending on the cross-over direction.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nFirst, determine the total number of possible double mutants:\n\nSince there are two mutations, the possible double mutants are AB and BA. Assuming that the two mutations are linked, the number of AB and BA double mutants should be equal. However, in this case, on strain B, we have 4 double mutants, and on strain K, 40. That's a significant difference, which suggests that most double mutants are on strain K, implying that the recombination occurred frequently.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nR = (number of double mutants on target)/(total number of possible double mutants)\n\nAssuming that the number of possible double mutants is 2 (each mutation can pair with the other once), but in reality, it's often expressed as:\n\nNumber of double mutants = 2 * n * (1 - r)\n\nWhere n is the number of individuals and r is the recombination frequency. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the chi-squared test to see if the observed frequencies fit a model of no recombination. However, given the complexity, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the ratio of double mutants on the two strains reflects the recombination fraction. If the two strains produce double mutants in a 1:10 ratio, that suggests that recombination occurred at approximately 10%, but that's speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers are percentages from 0.01% up to 5%. Given that recombination rates in bacteria are typically measured in fractions, a 1% recombination rate would correspond to a 1/99 chance, but in terms of observed double mutants, it would translate to a certain percentage.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation is as follows:\n\nThe recombination frequency is calculated by comparing the number of double mutants on each strain. The expected number under no recombination (where the two mutations are independent) would be:\n\nIf there are m plotes on strain B and n plotes on strain K, and assuming that double mutants occur when both mutations are present, then the expected number of double mutants on each strain would depend on the number of combinations.\n\nHowever, given the confusion in interpretation, perhaps a better approach is to look at the ratio of double mutants between the two strains.\n\nOn strain B: 4 double mutants\nOn strain K: 40 double mutants\n\nThis suggests that almost all double mutants are on strain K, indicating a high recombination frequency. The ratio is 40:4 = 10:1, meaning that 10 times more double mutants appear on strain K than on strain B. \n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the following approximation:\n\nRecombination frequency \u2248 (number of double mutants on K) / (total number of double mutants)\n\nHere, total double mutants = 40 (K) + 4 (B) = 44.\n\nThus, R \u2248 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier thought that the answer might be lower. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the recombination frequency is calculated differently.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the number of double mutants observed can be used to estimate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nR = (number of double mutants on target) / (total number of double mutants)\n\nWhich in this case is 40 / (40 + 4) = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909, which is about 91%. But this seems very high, and none of the options go beyond 5%, which suggests I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the data. The problem states that after treating the first half with 1:1e7 and placing on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes appeared. The second half was treated with 1:1e5 and placed on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. So, perhaps each half contains 10000 plotes, and 4 on B, 40 on K.\n\nBut the exact numbers aren't clear. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of double mutants on each strain, which is 4 on B and 40 on K.\n\nAssuming that, the total double mutants are 44. If most are on K, that suggests a high recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula R = (number of double mutants on target) / (total number of double mutants), we get 40 / 44 \u2248 91%, which is not among the options. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the data.\n\nPerhaps the numbers represent the count of each mutation type on each strain. That is, on strain B, 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y, while on strain K, it's different.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the resultally split into two halves, with half treated on B and half on K. Each half had varying plote counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of each mutation type on each strain. For example, on strain B, 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y, and on strain K, 4 phages with mutation Z and 40 with mutation W. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The key is that when both mutation types are present, the number of plotes on each strain gives information about their interaction. The ratio of plotes on the two strains can indicate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to recall that in such experiments, the number of double mutants observed can help estimate the recombination frequency. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of double mutants on target) / (Total number of double mutants)\n\nIn this case, the target is strain K, so RF = 40 / (40 + 4) = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. But this is much higher than any of the options provided, which range from 0.01% to 5%.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the numbers represent the number of each mutation type on each strain, rather than the number of double mutants. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose on strain B, there are 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y. On strain K, there are 4 phages with mutation Z and 40 with mutation W. However, this doesn't directly relate to recombination unless X and Z are the same mutation, etc. But this seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of each mutation type on each strain, and the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of the number of double mutants to the product of the individual mutation frequencies. However, this requires knowing the frequencies before recombination, which may not be straightforward.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the high number of double mutants on K compared to B suggests a high recombination frequency. Among the options, 2% (B) and 1% (D) are the smallest, whereas 10% and 15% would be moderate. However, the calculated 90% is not an option, so perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants is related to the square of the number of recombination events. However, without knowing the exact mathematical relationship, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer, even though the calculations lead to 90%, might be D (0.01%) or B (2%). But considering that recombination rates are usually small in bacterial systems, 1% seems more reasonable. However, the calculation suggests a much higher frequency, which doesn't align with typical bacterial recombination practices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of double mutants on one strain suggests that recombination occurred, and the number of double mutants on each strain relates to the recombination frequency. For instance, if R is the recombination frequency, the expected number of double mutants on the target strain would be (number of phages) * (1 - R)^2, assuming independent assortment. But without knowing the total number of phages, this becomes difficult.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity and time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial calculation that leads to a recombination frequency of approximately 90%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the lowest option, which is 1% (D). However, this contradicts the expectation of recombination being low in bacteria.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants on each strain is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency. Thus, if strain K has significantly more double mutants, it implies a high recombination frequency, which would suggest a lower RF value. However, the options do not include a value close to 90%.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest plausible answer is 2% (B), as it represents a moderate recombination frequency, even though the calculation suggests otherwise.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first case, where only lysogenic phages are present, all should die off because they don't lyse the cell. But in reality, the E. coli strain B isn't completely cleared; instead, half is cleared, then further treated with different dilutions. That probably indicates that some of the phages didn't interact properly and died off.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the key point is that when both types are present, the effect depends on whether they interfere with each other. Since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause lytic fission) affects strain B, but the lytic phage (which does) doesn't affect strain B. So why did strain B not get cleared? Maybe because the presence of the lysogenic phage caused some change in the lysogenic phage itself, leading to more activity. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to integrate better into the host genome, causing more efficient replication and thus more lytic fission events. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might be under an antibiotic stress, like the presence of an inducer like ciprofloxacin, which would allow the lysogenic phage to replicate despite being less active.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, half of the E. coli is cleared, then further treatment with different dilutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the recombination frequency is calculated differently.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the number of double mutants observed can be used to estimate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nR = (number of double mutants on target) / (total number of double mutants)\n\nWhich in this case is 40 / (40 + 4) = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909, which is about 91%. But this seems very high, and none of the options go beyond 5%, which suggests I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the data. The problem states that after treating the first half with 1:1e7 and placing on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes appeared. The second half was treated with 1:1e5 and placed on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. So, perhaps each half contains 10000 plotes, and 4 on B, 40 on K.\n\nBut the exact numbers aren't clear. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of double mutants on each strain, which is 4 on B and 40 on K.\n\nAssuming that, the total double mutants are 44. If most are on K, that suggests a high recombination frequency.\n\nUsing the formula R = (number of double mutants on target) / (total number of double mutants), we get 40 / 44 \u2248 91%, which is not among the options. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the data.\n\nPerhaps the numbers represent the count of each mutation type on each strain. That is, on strain B, 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y, while on strain K, it's different.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the resultally split into two halves, with half treated on B and half on K. Each half had varying plote counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of each mutation type on each strain. For example, on strain B, 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y, and on strain K, 4 phages with mutation Z and 40 with mutation W. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The key is that when both mutation types are present, the number of plotes on each strain gives information about their interaction. The ratio of plotes on the two strains can indicate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to recall that in such experiments, the number of double mutants observed can help estimate the recombination frequency. The formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of double mutants on target) / (Total number of double mutants)\n\nIn this case, the target is strain K, so RF = 40 / (40 + 4) = 40 / 44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. But this is much higher than any of the options provided, which range from 0.01% to 5%.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the numbers represent the number of each mutation type on each strain, rather than the number of double mutants. Let's consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose on strain B, there are 4 phages with mutation X and 40 with mutation Y. On strain K, there are 4 phages with mutation Z and 40 with mutation W. However, this doesn't directly relate to recombination unless X and Z are the same mutation, etc. But this seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the count of each mutation type on each strain, and the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of the number of double mutants to the product of the individual mutation frequencies. However, this requires knowing the frequencies before recombination, which may not be straightforward.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that the high number of double mutants on K compared to B suggests a high recombination frequency. Among the options, 2% (B) and 1% (D) are the smallest, whereas 10% and 15% would be moderate. However, the calculated 90% is not an option, so perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants is related to the square of the number of recombination events. However, without knowing the exact mathematical relationship, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer, even though the calculations lead to 90%, might be D (0.01%) or B (2%). But considering that recombination rates are usually small in bacterial systems, 1% seems more reasonable. However, the calculation suggests a much higher frequency, which doesn't align with typical bacterial recombination practices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of double mutants on one strain suggests that recombination occurred, and the number of double mutants on each strain relates to the recombination frequency. For instance, if R is the recombination frequency, the expected number of double mutants on the target strain would be (number of phages) * (1 - R)^2, assuming independent assortment. But without knowing the total number of phages, this becomes difficult.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity and time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial calculation that leads to a recombination frequency of approximately 90%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the lowest option, which is 1% (D). However, this contradicts the expectation of recombination being low in bacteria.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of double mutants on each strain is inversely proportional to the recombination frequency. Thus, if strain K has significantly more double mutants, it implies a high recombination frequency, which would suggest a lower RF value. However, the options do not include a value close to 90%.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest plausible answer is 2% (B), as it represents a moderate recombination frequency, even though the calculation suggests otherwise.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Let me clarify: Each half has been treated separately. Half was plated at 1:1e7, so each well would have, say, 1e6 cells, and the other half at 1:1e5 would have 1e5 cells. When plated on strain B, all the cells from the first half (plated at 1:1e7) would be exposed to the phages from both mutation types. Similarly, the second half (plated at 1:1e5) would also be exposed to both phages. Since both mutation types cause different outcomes (lytic vs. lysogenic), their interactions might lead to certain patterns. But perhaps the key here is to determine how much recombination there is. Recombination refers to the mixing of alleles from different sources within the same gene locus. In phages, especially T_4, which typically have a dominant mutation causing lysis and a recessive mutation causing lysogeny, recombination could occur if the mutations interact. However, in this case, the phages are mutant and may have their own mutations within the T_4 genome. Wait, but T_4 phages usually have a dominant mutation (like R) that causes lysis and a recessive mutation (like S) that causes lysogeny. If there's recombination, then the presence of both mutations might result in either lysogeny or lysis depending on where they occurred. Alternatively, without recombination, the order matters. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach this systematically. The problem states that the T_4 phages carrying mutations in regions rII can cause lysosis in strain B but not in strain K. So in region rII, the mutation (say, R) causes lysis, while another mutation (say, S) doesn't. Now, the plate has two types of mutantphages: one with R and another with S. When mixed, the outcome is that strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the combination of R and S somehow leads to the lysogenic effect. That implies that the combination caused a change in the mutation. Perhaps the R and S mutations recombine within the T_4 genome, leading to new combinations. This would explain why strain B, which already has a lysogenic mutation (S), remains mostly affected even with the R mutation. On the other hand, strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation (it might have a dominant mutation like T that doesn't interfere), gets affected more because the R mutation somehow combines with its existing T mutation to cause lysogeny. Wait, but in the experiment, strain B is being plated with both the R and S mutants, whereas strain K is being plated with only the S mutants? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me read again: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So half is treated with the R and S mutants (because they're both mutantphages?), and the other half is treated with only the S mutants. Because strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, any R mutation would cause lysogeny, which would affect strain K. But according to the results, 40 plumes are found on B, which probably means that the R mutation combined with the S mutation led to lysogeny in some of the cases. Meanwhile, on K, 4 plumes were found, suggesting that only the R mutation caused lysogeny. Therefore, the recombination likely occurs, as the combination of R and S mutations resulted in lysogeny. Now, the question is about the amount of recombination. To find this, we consider the likelihood of recombination given the observed results. If there was complete recombination, all the cells would have the recombinant mutation. If there was no recombination, all would have the original mutations. The probability of recombination can be estimated based on the observed distribution of plumes. However, without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps we can estimate it using the frequency of plumes. For example, if there's a 25% chance of recombination, then half the cells would have the recombined mutation, contributing to the lysogeny effect. Alternatively, the results indicate that the R and S mutations recombine because only a subset of the cells are affected in strain B. Maybe the recombination fraction can be calculated as the ratio of recombinant to total cells. But without specific data, perhaps we can use the observed numbers to infer the recombination rate. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the initial concentrations of the mutantphages. Given that the first half (plated at 1:1e7) would have fewer cells, and the second half at 1:1e5 would have more, the presence of more phages in the second half might suggest more opportunities for recombination. However, this line of reasoning isn't very precise. Instead, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the fact that the R and S mutations recombine explains the differing levels of lysogeny seen in strains B and K. Specifically, the lack of recombination in strain K would imply that the R mutation alone causes lysogeny, whereas the presence of recombination allows for some lysogeny despite the absence of the lysogenic mutation in the original strain. Therefore, the recombination must be happening within the T_4 phage's DNA. The options provided are percentages ranging from 0.01% to 5%. Based on standard genetic theory, the probability of recombination between two loci can often be around 1-2%, but sometimes higher.

Looking back at the answer choices, option F is 0.3 percent, which seems plausible. Alternatively, option G is 0.5 percent, which is closer. Without more precise calculations, I might lean towards F or G. However, I recall that in such experiments, the recombination fraction can be approximated by the ratio of the differences in dilution factors or the difference in expression of the mutations.

The fact that only strain B is affected suggests that the lysogenic phage might be dominant or that it's combining with another mutation. However, the problem states that both types of mutantphage are present, so perhaps their combination leads to some interference. \n\nThe key here is to determine how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different genes located in the same DNA molecule. Since both mutations are in the T_4 phage's genome, their recombination would affect whether they interact or interfere with each other. If they recombine, they might produce a new variant that could cause different effects. In the experiment, when both phages are present, only strain B is affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) is the dominant type, possibly due to some sort of competition or interference from the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a stronger effect, making the lysogenic phage dominant even though both are present.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the lysogenic phage was plated on strain B's lawn, it caused a failure (lyses), while the other half, which had the lysogenic phage combined with the recombined mutation, was successful (did not lyse). Wait, no\u2014the description says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning only the lysogenic phage did something wrong. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is the dominant one, and the recombined phage doesn't do anything, hence it isn't detected as a failure. Therefore, the presence of the recombined phage didn't lead to a failure, implying that it didn't interact with the lysogenic phage in a way that caused failure.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me clarify: when both mutantphages are present, only strain B is affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is the dominant one, and any recombination between its mutation and another mutation doesn't affect the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, maybe the recombination doesn't allow the lysogenic phage to replicate or cause failure. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nThe problem mentions that the recombination determines the outcome. If there's recombination, it might alter the fitness of the offspring genotype. In this case, the lysogenic phage (non-lysed) is good, while the other type (lysogenic) is bad. If recombination occurs, the offspring could have a different phenotype, which affects the number of plasmids formed. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would dominate, leading to failure (lysis) in strain B. With recombination, perhaps the offspring don't fail, meaning recombination reduces the failure rate. \n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is present alone, all colonies die (only strain B is affected). When the other half contains a recombined mutation, only 4 plumes are found on strain K, which suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't fail, indicating that the recombination didn't allow the lysogenic phage to replicate successfully. Therefore, the recombination must prevent the lysogenic phage from replicating, thus avoiding failure. Conversely, when the other half (recombined) is placed on strain K, which presumably has a different mutation (maybe the lysogenic mutation?), the lysogenic phage still doesn't fail, but the other mutation may cause failure. However, in the data, 40 plumes are found on strain B and 4 on K. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the plate for strain B is treated with 1:1e7 dilution and placed on strain B's lawn. Strain K is treated with 1:1e5 and placed on strain K's lawn. The results are 4 on K and 40 on B. Since 1:1e5 is more dilution than 1:1e7, the probability of each plasmid forming a successful infection is higher. So if the lysogenic phage is successful, it would form 100% plasmids on strain B's lawn. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, with 1:1e5, the lysogenic phage would also survive better, but if the recombination allows it to replicate, then maybe it would form more plasmids.\n\nBut according to the data, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Hmm. Maybe the recombination makes the lysogenic phage unable to replicate, hence only 4 plumes on K where it didn't fail. Wait, no\u2014strain K's lawn is treated with 1:1e5, so the chance of each plasmid being successful is higher. If the lysogenic phage can't replicate, it wouldn't form plasmids, but the recombination might make it so that the lysogenic phage cannot replicate. Alternatively, the recombination might prevent the lysogenic phage from replicating, leading to less plating on strain B, but in our case, 40 plumes on B, which is higher than expected if the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate. Alternatively, maybe the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to structure my thoughts:\n\n1. When only the lysogenic phage is present:\n   - All colonies die (lysis).\n   - Only strain B is affected.\n   \n2. When the other half (with recombination) is placed on strain B's lawn:\n   - Only 4 plumes are found (so, 4 successful infections).\n   - These plumes likely originate from the recombination mutation, as the lysogenic phage alone failed all.\n\n3. When the other half is placed on strain K's lawn:\n   - 4 plumes are found.\n   - Assuming the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate, we'd expect more plumes on strain K, but instead, there are fewer. Alternatively, if recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, we might get fewer plumes on strain K.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, when the other half is on strain B's lawn, which is the same as the original scenario, only the lysogenic phage fails, so 40 plumes on B indicate that 40 plasmids were successfully replicated. On the other hand, when the same recombination mutation is placed on strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes are found. Now, considering that 1:1e5 is a higher dilution than 1:1e7, the chance of successful replication is higher. If recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, then there would be fewer plumes on strain K. Alternatively, if recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate, more plumes would show up on strain K.\n\nGiven that on strain B, 40 plumes are found, and on strain K, 4 are found, and considering that 1:1e5 is a higher dilution, the number of plumes indicates the frequency of successful infections. If recombination prevented the lysogenic phage from replicating, then fewer plumes would appear on strain K compared to strain B. Hence, the difference of 36 plumes (from 40 to 4) supports the idea that recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, thereby reducing the number of plumes on strain K.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination allowed the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively, we would see more plumes on strain K, but here we see fewer. Therefore, recombination must be occurring in such a way that it prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, resulting in fewer plumes on strain K.\n\nNow, to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is given by:\n\n rf = (p * q * N) / (N + p*q)\n\nwhere p is the frequency of the wildtype allele, q is the frequency of the mutant allele, and N is the total number of cells. However, in this context, since we're dealing with plasmids and not actual alleles, the approach might differ. Instead, we can use the concept that the presence of the recombination mutation reduces the likelihood of successful replication of the lysogenic phage.\n\nAssuming that recombination reduces the success of the lysogenic phage by a certain percentage, say x%, then the observed number of plumes on strain K would reflect this reduction. Given that the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), it suggests that the replication efficiency was reduced by 95% (since 1/10 is 0.1, or 10%). Therefore, the recombination must account for this reduction.\n\nIf the recombination reduces the replication efficiency by r%, then the fraction of successful plasmids would be (1 - r/100). The observed number of plumes on strain K is 4, whereas on strain B it's 40. Assuming that the replication efficiency without recombination is high (say, 80%), then the presence of recombination reduces it further. Let\u2019s denote the replication efficiency as e. Then, e = (number of plumes) / (total potential plumes). For strain B, e_B = 40 / 40 = 1 (100%). For strain K, e_K = 4 / (40 * e_recomb) )? Not sure. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40=0.1, suggesting that the replication efficiency is 10% of normal. Therefore, the recombination accounts for a reduction of 90%. So, recombination frequency is approximately 10%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest match is option J: 0.05 percent. However, 10% is much larger than the provided options. It seems I've made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated differently. The recombination frequency can be estimated using the number of recombinant plasmids observed. If the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4:40, simplifying to 1:10, that suggests that the replication efficiency on K is 10% of B's. If the recombination frequency is small, say 0.05%, then the replication efficiency would decrease significantly. Alternatively, the recombination frequency might be related to the square root of the ratio of plumes, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the difference in plume counts reflects the difference in replication efficiencies. If the replication efficiency on strain K is 10% of B's, and assuming that recombination contributes to this reduction, then the recombination frequency would correspond to a reduction of 90% in replication efficiency. Using the formula for recombination frequency, which relates to the likelihood of recombination events, a significant reduction would imply a moderate recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the options, the closest fit is D: 0.1 percent, which is 0.001 in decimal terms, corresponding to a recombination frequency of about sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is low, say 0.05%, then the replication efficiency would drop by a significant amount, leading to the observed ratio of plumes.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct answer is B: 2 percent, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the answer might be C: 1.5 percent, but again, I'm unsure. Given the experimental setup and the results, the most plausible answer is B: 2 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In E. coli, especially in regions like T_4, when multiple mutations occur, they can either interfere with each other or coexist without causing issues. The fact that only strain B is affected suggests that the lysogenic phage might be dominant or that it's combining with another mutation. However, the problem states that both types of mutantphage are present, so perhaps their combination leads to some interference. \n\nThe key here is to determine how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different genes located in the same DNA molecule. Since both mutations are in the T_4 phage's genome, their recombination would affect whether they interact or interfere with each other. If they recombine, they might produce a new variant that could cause different effects. In the experiment, when both phages are present, only strain B is affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) is the dominant type, possibly due to some sort of competition or interference from the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a stronger effect, making the lysogenic phage dominant even though both are present.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the lysogenic phage was plated on strain B's lawn, it caused a failure (lyses), while the other half, which had the lysogenic phage combined with the recombined mutation, was successful (did not lyse). Wait, no\u2014the description says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning only the lysogenic phage did something wrong. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is the dominant one, and the recombined phage doesn't do anything, hence it isn't detected as a failure. Therefore, the presence of the recombined phage didn't lead to a failure, implying that it didn't interact with the lysogenic phage in a way that caused failure.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me clarify: when both mutantphages are present, only strain B is affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is the dominant one, and any recombination between its mutation and another mutation doesn't affect the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, maybe the recombination doesn't allow the lysogenic phage to replicate or cause failure. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nThe problem mentions that the recombination determines the outcome. If there's recombination, it might alter the fitness of the offspring genotype. In this case, the lysogenic phage (non-lysed) is good, while the other type (lysogenic) is bad. If recombination occurs, the offspring could have a different phenotype, which affects the number of plasmids formed. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would dominate, leading to failure (lysis) in strain B. With recombination, perhaps the offspring don't fail, meaning recombination reduces the failure rate. \n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is present alone, all colonies die (only strain B is affected). When the other half contains a recombined mutation, only 4 plumes are found on strain K, which suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't fail, indicating that the recombination didn't allow the lysogenic phage to replicate successfully. Therefore, the recombination must prevent the lysogenic phage from replicating, thus avoiding failure. Conversely, when the other half (recombined) is placed on strain K, which presumably has a different mutation (maybe the lysogenic mutation?), the lysogenic phage still doesn't fail, but the other mutation may cause failure. However, in the data, 40 plumes are found on strain B and 4 on K. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the plate for strain B is treated with 1:1e7 dilution and placed on strain B's lawn. Strain K is treated with 1:1e5 and placed on strain K's lawn. The results are 4 on K and 40 on B. Since 1:1e5 is more dilution than 1:1e7, the probability of each plasmid forming a successful infection is higher. So if the lysogenic phage is successful, it would form 100% plasmids on strain B's lawn. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, with 1:1e5, the lysogenic phage would also survive better, but if the recombination allows it to replicate, then maybe it would form more plasmids.\n\nBut according to the data, 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Hmm. Maybe the recombination makes the lysogenic phage unable to replicate, hence only 4 plumes on K where it didn't fail. Wait, no\u2014strain K's lawn is treated with 1:1e5, so the chance of each plasmid being successful is higher. If the lysogenic phage can't replicate, it wouldn't form plasmids, but the recombination might make it so that the lysogenic phage cannot replicate. Alternatively, the recombination might prevent the lysogenic phage from replicating, leading to less plating on strain B, but in our case, 40 plumes on B, which is higher than expected if the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate. Alternatively, maybe the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to structure my thoughts:\n\n1. When only the lysogenic phage is present:\n   - All colonies die (lysis).\n   - Only strain B is affected.\n   \n2. When the other half (with recombination) is placed on strain B's lawn:\n   - Only 4 plumes are found (so, 4 successful infections).\n   - These plumes likely originate from the recombination mutation, as the lysogenic phage alone failed all.\n\n3. When the other half is placed on strain K's lawn:\n   - 4 plumes are found.\n   - Assuming the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate, we'd expect more plumes on strain K, but instead, there are fewer. Alternatively, if recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, we might get fewer plumes on strain K.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, when the other half is on strain B's lawn, which is the same as the original scenario, only the lysogenic phage fails, so 40 plumes on B indicate that 40 plasmids were successfully replicated. On the other hand, when the same recombination mutation is placed on strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes are found. Now, considering that 1:1e5 is a higher dilution than 1:1e7, the chance of successful replication is higher. If recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, then there would be fewer plumes on strain K. Alternatively, if recombination allows the lysogenic phage to replicate, more plumes would show up on strain K.\n\nGiven that on strain B, 40 plumes are found, and on strain K, 4 are found, and considering that 1:1e5 is a higher dilution, the number of plumes indicates the frequency of successful infections. If recombination prevented the lysogenic phage from replicating, then fewer plumes would appear on strain K compared to strain B. Hence, the difference of 36 plumes (from 40 to 4) supports the idea that recombination prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, thereby reducing the number of plumes on strain K.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination allowed the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively, we would see more plumes on strain K, but here we see fewer. Therefore, recombination must be occurring in such a way that it prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating, resulting in fewer plumes on strain K.\n\nNow, to calculate the percentage recombination. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is given by:\n\n rf = (p * q * N) / (N + p*q)\n\nwhere p is the frequency of the wildtype allele, q is the frequency of the mutant allele, and N is the total number of cells. However, in this context, since we're dealing with plasmids and not actual alleles, the approach might differ. Instead, we can use the concept that the presence of the recombination mutation reduces the likelihood of successful replication of the lysogenic phage.\n\nAssuming that recombination reduces the success of the lysogenic phage by a certain percentage, say x%, then the observed number of plumes on strain K would reflect this reduction. Given that the number of plumes decreased by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), it suggests that the replication efficiency was reduced by 95% (since 1/10 is 0.1, or 10%). Therefore, the recombination must account for this reduction.\n\nIf the recombination reduces the replication efficiency by r%, then the fraction of successful plasmids would be (1 - r/100). The observed number of plumes on strain K is 4, whereas on strain B it's 40. Assuming that the replication efficiency without recombination is high (say, 80%), then the presence of recombination reduces it further. Let\u2019s denote the replication efficiency as e. Then, e = (number of plumes) / (total potential plumes). For strain B, e_B = 40 / 40 = 1 (100%). For strain K, e_K = 4 / (40 * e_recomb) )? Not sure.

However, the fact that only half the population shows full infection (or none) might indicate whether the mutations are independent or linked. \n\nThe user mentioned that the result showed a division where half is split into different concentrations and then plated on different bacterial strains. The half that's more concentrated (1:10^7) is likely to be on strain B's lawn, and the less concentrated is on strain K. The number of plumes found on each indicates how effective the phage was in causing infection. If the phage carries mutations, their ability to infect depends on whether the mutations are present in the host. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, its presence could lead to lysogeny, but if the phage has a mutation, it might affect replication or integration. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't doing anything bad, while the other type is. Maybe the mutations are on the same gene or nearby genes affecting the phage's ability to replicate or integrate into the host DNA.\n\nWhen both types are present, the effect depends on the recombination between the mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phages. If the mutations are independent (no recombination), the probability of both mutations occurring in a phage is the product of their individual probabilities. If they are recombined (some overlap), the probability changes. In this scenario, since only some of the phages from the mixed culture led to infection on strain B, it suggests that when both mutations were present, the phages still had some chance to infect, but in combination, they caused some issues. However, since the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, it implies that when both mutations were present, the phages were less likely to infect, indicating that at least one mutation must be present in all cells to allow infection. This suggests that the mutations are not recombining; otherwise, they would sometimes lead to phages without either mutation, allowing them to infect. Therefore, the mutations are probably on separate loci or non-recombinant.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K. Plumes represent the number of new colonies formed when phages infect bacteria. A high number like 40 on strain B might indicate that the phages from the mixed culture were more likely to infect, but since the majority showed no infection, it suggests that the presence of both mutation types reduces their effectiveness. Alternatively, if the mutations prevent the phages from infecting, then the presence of both mutations would decrease the likelihood of infection. So the observed data supports the idea that the mutations are on separate regions, not recombining.\n\nBut wait, another angle: when both mutations are present, the phages might have a reduced chance of infecting because they carry both mutations, possibly making them more efficient or less stable. If the mutations are recombined, their combined effect could be different. However, if the mutations are independent, the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is the product of their individual probabilities. Let's say the frequency of the first mutation is p and the second is q. Normally, the chance of a phage having neither mutation is (1-p)(1-q). But since we see that when both mutations are present, the phages don't infect as much, it suggests that when both are present, the phage has a lower chance of infecting. This could happen if the mutations are on separate genes, meaning they're independent. Alternatively, if they are on the same gene, recombination wouldn't occur, and their effects would add up multiplicatively.\n\nGiven that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, it suggests that when both mutations were present, the phages didn't get enough time to infect. Or perhaps the mutations are such that even with both present, the phage cannot effectively replicate or integrate. This could imply that the mutations are in separate regions, not recombining. If they were recombining, they might have more opportunities to find compatible sites on the host DNA, leading to more successful infections, which contradicts the observation.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Rate = (p + q - pq) / (1 - pq)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. However, since the problem states that the result \"divided in half,\" suggesting equal distribution, and the recombination is being tested across the entire region, perhaps we should consider the expected number of recombinants versus non-combiners.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the phage has a lower chance of infecting. This might indicate that the recombination allows for better replication, thus reducing the chance of failure. So, if the recombination rate is zero, the mutations are independent, and the chance of both mutations being present in a phage is (1-p)(1-q). If the recombination rate is non-zero, the chance increases, potentially lowering the overall success rate.\n\nGiven that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, this suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the chance of infection. Thus, the recombination rate is low. To estimate the recombination rate, we can look at the ratio of recombinants to non-recombinants. If recombination is minimal, the proportion of recombinant phages would be small, leading to a lower chance of both mutations being present in a phage.\n\nIn the given experiment, the plates were split into two groups: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and one with lower (1:10^5). Each group was plated on different bacterial strains. The result was 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K. Assuming that the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is proportional to the dilution factor, we can set up equations to solve for the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the recombination rate. Then, the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is R * (1-p)*(1-q). However, without knowing p and q individually, it's tricky. Another approach is to assume that the total number of possible combinations is related to the dilutions. For example, higher dilution (more cells per well) corresponds to lower p*q, implying less recombination. Given that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, it suggests that the combination of mutations leads to reduced infectivity, supporting low recombination.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate is very low, say r, then the number of recombinant phages would be r times the total number of phages. However, without specific values for p and q, it's challenging. Perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that when both mutations are present, the chance of both being present decreases. This could indicate that recombination occurs infrequently, hence the recombination rate is low.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the answer choices are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 5%. Based on the reasoning above, the recombination rate seems to be low, but the exact value isn\u2019t directly calculated here. However, typically, recombination rates in phage genomes are quite low, often less than 1%, especially in rapidly evolving regions. Among the options, 0.02% and 0.05% are very low, but 0.1% and above are considered moderate. However, the calculation needs to be precise.\n\nAnother way is to note that the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K. Since the dilution factors are inversely related to the number of cells plated, a higher dilution (lower number of cells) corresponds to a higher concentration of phages. If the phages from the mixed culture have a lower chance of infecting strain B, it might suggest that the presence of both mutations reduces their infectivity, possibly due to reduced efficiency in replication or integration. This could imply that recombination occurs infrequently, leading to a low recombination rate.\n\nConsidering that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, the recombination rate is likely very low. Among the options, 0.02% and 0.05% are very low, but perhaps closer examination reveals that the correct answer is 0.05%, corresponding to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

If the recombination rate is non-zero, the chance increases, potentially lowering the overall success rate.\n\nGiven that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, this suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the chance of infection. Thus, the recombination rate is low. To estimate the recombination rate, we can look at the ratio of recombinants to non-recombinants. If recombination is minimal, the proportion of recombinant phages would be small, leading to a lower chance of both mutations being present in a phage.\n\nIn the given experiment, the plates were split into two groups: one with higher dilution (1:10^7) and one with lower (1:10^5). Each group was plated on different bacterial strains. The result was 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K. Assuming that the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is proportional to the dilution factor, we can set up equations to solve for the recombination rate.\n\nLet\u2019s denote R as the recombination rate. Then, the probability of a phage carrying both mutations is R * (1-p)*(1-q). However, without knowing p and q individually, it's tricky. Another approach is to assume that the total number of possible combinations is related to the dilutions. For example, higher dilution (more cells per well) corresponds to lower p*q, implying less recombination. Given that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, it suggests that the combination of mutations leads to reduced infectivity, supporting low recombination.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate is very low, say r, then the number of recombinant phages would be r times the total number of phages. However, without specific values for p and q, it's challenging. Perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that when both mutations are present, the chance of both being present decreases. This could indicate that recombination occurs infrequently, hence the recombination rate is low.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the answer choices are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 5%. Based on the reasoning above, the recombination rate seems to be low, but the exact value isn\u2019t directly calculated here. However, typically, recombination rates in phage genomes are quite low, often less than 1%, especially in rapidly evolving regions. Among the options, 0.02% and 0.05% are very low, but 0.1% and above are considered moderate. However, the calculation needs to be precise.\n\nAnother way is to note that the number of plumes on strain B is four times that on strain K. Since the dilution factors are inversely related to the number of cells plated, a higher dilution (lower number of cells) corresponds to a higher concentration of phages. If the phages from the mixed culture have a lower chance of infecting strain B, it might suggest that the presence of both mutations reduces their infectivity, possibly due to reduced efficiency in replication or integration. This could imply that recombination occurs infrequently, leading to a low recombination rate.\n\nConsidering that the majority of the colonies on strain B showed no infection, the recombination rate is likely very low. Among the options, 0.02% and 0.05% are very low, but perhaps closer examination reveals that the correct answer is 0.05%, corresponding to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of lysogenic phages increases the likelihood of another mutation occurring. \n\nWait, the experiment shows that when both types are present, the number of plumes (infections) on strain K is much higher than expected if they were independent. Normally, if they're independent, their combined effect might be additive. For example, if each mutation has a certain rate, the probability that either mutation occurs could be calculated using the formula 1 - (1-p)(1-q), where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation. However, in this case, the presence of one type affects the outcome of the other. \n\nLooking at the numbers: When only lysogenic phages are used, all the phages die, so the entire population should be cleared. But when both types are present, only half the bacteria are lysogenic, and the other half are normal. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phages are causing some damage, but perhaps the normal phages don't do anything because they're not mutated. Or maybe the lysogenic phages are causing some lethality, while the normal phages are still alive but don't affect the lysogenic ones. \n\nBut the key part is the dilution factors and the resulting plausibility. Let me recall that in such experiments, the number of phages in the plating media determines the probability of infection. The higher the dilution factor (lower concentration), the less likely each phage will infect the target cell. So in the first case, when only lysogenic phages are used (and presumably their mutation doesn't affect this?), wait, no\u2014wait, the first scenario is when only lysogenic phages are used, right? Because only the lysogenic phage does something. So when they use only lysogenic phages, they kill all the E. coli in that half. Then they dilute it 1:1e7 and plate on strain B's lawn. Since all the phages are lysogenic and cause death, the entire population should die, leading to a high number of plumes on strain B's lawn. But the second experiment uses a mix of both mutation types. \n\nIn the second case, the half is diluted 1:1e5, meaning more cells are plated. Some of these cells may contain both types of phages. Now, when both types are present, they might interact. For instance, the lysogenic phage could induce the mutation in the normal phage, or vice versa. But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage was responsible for causing the lytic fission in strain B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage induces the mutation in the normal phage, making it lysogenic as well, thus becoming a double mutation. But if both are present, the lysogenic phage might also lead to the same result, killing the cell, whereas the normal phage isn't mutated, so it remains normal. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of lysogenic phages could increase the chances that the normal phages become lysogenic due to some interaction. For example, the lysogenic phage could mutate the normal phage's gene, causing it to become lysogenic. If that happens, then the normal phage would also lyse the E. coli, causing more death. But the problem states that only the lysogenic phage caused the lytic fission in strain B. So maybe the normal phage wasn't affected, but when mixed with the lysogenic phage, the normal phage becomes lysogenic, leading to more death. \n\nNow, looking at the data: On strain K's lawn, there were 4 plumes, and on strain B's lawn, 40. The total number of plumes depends on the dilution factor. The half that was plated on strain B had a dilution factor of 1:1e7, so the concentration is 1e-7 M. The other half was plated on strain K with 1:1e5, so 1e-5 M. \n\nThe number of plumes observed relates to the number of phages in the plating area. The formula is plumes = (concentration) * N, where N is the number of viable phages in the area. Assuming that both mutation types are present equally, the concentration is the average of the two plating areas. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. \n\nIf the two mutations are linked (recombined), then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is higher than if they were independent. In the first experiment, only lysogenic phages were used, so any mutation from the normal phage wouldn't occur. Therefore, when both are present, the chance of a phage having both mutations is higher than independently having each mutation. \n\nSo, in the first case, only lysogenic phages (mutant) are present. They die, so all cells die. Hence, the entire sample dies. In the second case, when both types are present, the mixture includes both lysogenic and normal phages. The lysogenic phages must have induced mutations in the normal phage. \n\nLet me consider the possible outcomes. Each phage has a certain chance of carrying each mutation. Suppose the probability of a phage being lysogenic (mutant) is p, and the probability of being normal (wild-type) is q=1-p. The combined probability of a phage having both mutations is pq. \n\nWhen only lysogenic phages are present (which they are in the first experiment), the probability that a phage has both mutations is zero because lysogenic phages cannot have double mutations. However, in reality, the lysogenic phage itself cannot have double mutations; it's just a single mutation. So when mixed with normal phages, the chance of a phage having both mutations is pq. \n\nIn the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, they kill all cells. Therefore, the entire population dies, so the number of plumes on strain B's lawn should be very high, potentially 100% if all cells are dead. \n\nIn the second experiment, when both types are present, only half the cells have both types. Some of these cells now have double mutations. The lysogenic phages, even though they are single mutants, might not necessarily have double mutations unless induced. Wait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phage caused the lytic fission in strain B. So perhaps the normal phage wasn't affected, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't cause the mutation in the normal phage. But if the normal phage was already lysogenic, it would die regardless. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the lysogenic phage is inducing the mutation in the normal phage. So the normal phage, which is normally wild-type, gains a mutation upon interaction with the lysogenic phage. This makes it a double mutant. Now, when this double mutant is present, it can lyse the E. coli. So in the first experiment, only lysogenic phages were present, which couldn't cause this double mutation. Therefore, in the first experiment, all cells died, leading to a high number of plumes. \n\nIn the second experiment, when both types are present, some cells have both mutations, others have only the lysogenic mutation. Cells without either mutation remain uninfected. So the total number of plumes depends on the proportion of cells with both mutations. \n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a mutation rate (say, \u03b1) and the normal phage has a mutation rate (\u03b2), the probability of both mutations is \u03b1\u03b2. However, in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage is present, so \u03b2 is zero (since lysogenic phages are single mutants). Therefore, in the first experiment, the number of plumes would depend solely on the lysogenic phage's mutation rate. \n\nBut in the second experiment, when both types are present, the cells with both mutations will lyse the E. coli, leading to more plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain K compared to strain B gives us information about the mutation rates. \n\nGiven that four plumes were found on strain K and 40 on strain B, we can infer that the number of cells with both mutations is much smaller than those with only lysogenic phages. So the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This implies that 10 times fewer cells have both mutations than have only lysogenic phages. \n\nAssuming that the mutation rates are independent, the fraction of cells with both mutations is \u03b1\u03b2. The fraction with only lysogenic is (1-\u03b1), and the fraction with only normal is (1-\u03b2). However, since \u03b2 is small (because lysogenic phages don't cause mutations in themselves), we can approximate the fraction of cells with both mutations as approximately \u03b1(1-\u03b2) \u2248 \u03b1. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B is \u03b1 : (1-\u03b1). Given that 40 plumes on B correspond to 1-\u03b1, and 4 plumes on K correspond to \u03b1. So \u03b1/(1-\u03b1) = 4/40 = 1/10. Solving this:\n\n\u03b1 = (1/10)(1 - \u03b1)\n10\u03b1 = 1 - \u03b1\n11\u03b1 = 1\n\u03b1 \u2248 1/11 \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 9%, so maybe my assumptions are off. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the number of cells plated is different. The first half is plated at 1:1e7, so 1e-7 M. The second half is plated at 1:1e5, so 1e-5 M. \n\nThe number of phages in the first half is N1 = C1 * n, where C1 is concentration (1e-7 M) and n is the number of cells plated. Similarly, N2 = C2 * n, where C2 is 1e-5 M. \n\nThe total number of phages is N_total = N1 + N2. The number of successful infections is N_total * p, where p is the probability of a phage carrying both mutations. \n\nThe number of plumes on strain B is proportional to the number of successful infections. So:\n\nPlumes_B = k * p * N1\nPlumes_K = k * p * N2\n\nWhere k is a constant of proportionality. Dividing Plumes_K / Plumes_B:\n\n(Plumes_K)/(Plumes_B) = (p * N2) / (p * N1) ) = N2/N1\n\nN2 is the number of phages plated on strain K (1e-5 M), N1 is 1e-7 M. So N2/N1 = (1e-5)/(1e-7) = 100. \n\nBut we observed Plumes_K = 4, Plumes_B = 40. So 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But according to the calculation, it should be 100x. So discrepancy arises. Perhaps the assumption that both mutations are rare is incorrect. Alternatively, the actual ratio might be influenced by the exact mutation rates. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage was present, leading to complete death of cells, while in the second experiment, a mixture leads to some death. The number of plumes on strain K is 4, on B is 40. So the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the number of cells with both mutations is 1/10th of those with only the lysogenic phage. \n\nIf we assume that the mutation rates are such that the probability of both mutations is negligible, except when combined with the lysogenic phage, then the ratio would reflect the relative frequencies. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability of both mutations given the observed plume counts. \n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the concentrations are 1e-7 and 1e-5. The number of phages in each area is 1e-7 * n and 1e-5 * n, respectively. The number of successful infections is proportional to the product of the concentration and the number of phages. Thus, the number of plumes on B is proportional to (1e-7 * n) * (probability of lysogenic phage carrying both mutations). Similarly, on K, it's (1e-5 * n) * same probability. \n\nThus, Plumes_B / Plumes_K = (1e-7 / 1e-5) = 0.01, which is 1%. But our observation is 4 vs 40, giving 10%. So again, discrepancy. Maybe the actual probability is higher due to the presence of both types. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage's mutation causes the normal phage to become double mutant, the probability of both mutations is the product of the individual probabilities. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation rate \u03b1, and the normal phage has a mutation rate \u03b2, then the double mutant has probability \u03b1\u03b2. \n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage's mutation rate is higher than the normal phage's. From the experiment, when both are present, the number of plumes on K is much lower than on B. So the cells with double mutants are fewer than those with only lysogenic phages. \n\nLet\u2019s denote P_double = \u03b1\u03b2. The probability that a phage is only lysogenic is (1-\u03b1), only normal is (1-\u03b2). The total probability of any mutation is (1-\u03b1)(1-\u03b2) + \u03b1\u03b2 = 1 - \u03b1 - \u03b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2. But in our case, most cells die, so probably only the double mutant survives. \n\nHowever, the observed number of plumes indicates that most cells die, suggesting that the double mutants are rare. So P_double is low, and (1-\u03b1)(1-\u03b2) is nearly 1. \n\nFrom the experiment, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 1/10, indicating that the number of cells with double mutants is 10% of those with only lysogenic phages. So the probability of a cell being a double mutant is 10% of being a single lysogenic. \n\nIf P_double = 0.1 * P_single, and P_single = (1-\u03b1), then 0.1*(1-\u03b1) = \u03b1\u03b2. Also, since the double mutants make the cells die, the overall survival rate is (1-P_double)*P_single + P_double*1 = (1 - 0.1*(1-\u03b1)) * (1-\u03b1) + 0.1*(1-\u03b1). But this seems complicated. Instead, focusing on the ratio: Plumes_K / Plumes_B = [\u03b1\u03b2 * (number of cells with both)] / [(1-\u03b1)*(number of cells with only lysogenic)] ] = [\u03b1\u03b2 * x] / [(1-\u03b1)x] = \u03b1\u03b2 / (1-\u03b1). We know this equals 4/40 = 0.1. So \u03b1\u03b2 / (1-\u03b1) = 0.1. \n\nAssuming that the mutation rates are small, so \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, then 1-\u03b1 \u2248 1, and \u03b1\u03b2 \u2248 0.1. But without knowing whether \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, this assumption might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, solving \u03b1\u03b2 = 0.1*(1-\u03b1). Let's suppose \u03b1 is 0.05, then \u03b2 = 0.1*(1-0.05)/0.05 = 0.1*0.95/0.05 = 0.18. So \u03b2\u224818%, which seems too high. Alternatively, if \u03b1 is 0.02, then \u03b2=0.1*(0.98)/0.02= 0.1*0.98/0.02=4.9. Still high. If \u03b1 is 0.01, \u03b2=0.1*(0.99)/0.01\u22489.9. Still high. If \u03b1 is 0.05, \u03b2=0.1*(0.95)/0.05=1.9. Still high. It seems like the required \u03b2 is quite high, around 20%, which might indicate a significant recombination. \n\nBut none of the options give a percentage above 20%. The highest option is F.0.3 percent. So perhaps my approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that the number of plumes relates to the square root of the product of the concentrations. Because the number of phages in each area is C * n, and the number of successful infections is proportional to sqrt(C1*C2), assuming Poisson statistics. \n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio of plumes would be sqrt((C1)/(C2)) = sqrt(1e-7 /1e-5)=sqrt(0.01)=0.1, which matches the 4/40=0.1 ratio. \n\nSo if the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(C1*C2), then the ratio Plumes_K / Plumes_B = sqrt((C1/C2)) = sqrt(1e-7 /1e-5)=sqrt(0.01)=0.1. Which aligns with our observation. \n\nThis suggests that the relationship is multiplicative under square roots. So the product of the concentrations is proportional to the square of the number of plumes. \n\nBut this complicates things further. However, given the answer choices, and considering that the closest match to a moderate recombination rate (not extremely high) is perhaps G.0.5 percent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, thinking back, if the recombination frequency is r, then the probability that a phage has both mutations is r * p, where p is the mutation rate of the normal phage. If p is small, say 0.01, then r needs to be ~10% to get the observed plume ratio. But none of the options have exactly 10%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, implying that the probability of a phage being a double mutant is 1/10th of being a single lysogenic. If the double mutants have a probability of 1/10th of single lysogenic, and assuming that the mutations are independent, then the probability of double mutants is p*q = (\u03b1)(\u03b2). And the probability of single lysogenic is (1-\u03b1) + (1-\u03b2). But this line of reasoning is unclear. \n\nMaybe a simpler approach: The experiment showed that the presence of both types leads to a decrease in plumes on K compared to B",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first case, only lysogenic phages cause death, so all those would die, leaving strain B mostly intact.

The total number of plumes depends on the dilution factor. The half that was plated on strain B had a dilution factor of 1:1e7, so the concentration is 1e-7 M. The other half was plated on strain K with 1:1e5, so 1e-5 M. \n\nThe number of plumes observed relates to the number of phages in the plating area.

So when mixed with normal phages, the chance of a phage having both mutations is pq. \n\nIn the first experiment, when only lysogenic phages are present, they kill all cells. Therefore, the entire population dies, so the number of plumes on strain B's lawn should be very high, potentially 100% if all cells are dead. \n\nIn the second experiment, when both types are present, only half the cells have both types. Some of these cells now have double mutations. The lysogenic phages, even though they are single mutants, might not necessarily have double mutations unless induced. Wait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phage caused the lytic fission in strain B. So perhaps the normal phage wasn't affected, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't cause the mutation in the normal phage. But if the normal phage was already lysogenic, it would die regardless. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the lysogenic phage is inducing the mutation in the normal phage. So the normal phage, which is normally wild-type, gains a mutation upon interaction with the lysogenic phage. This makes it a double mutant. Now, when this double mutant is present, it can lyse the E. coli. So in the first experiment, only lysogenic phages were present, which couldn't cause this double mutation. Therefore, in the first experiment, all cells died, leading to a high number of plumes. \n\nIn the second experiment, when both types are present, some cells have both mutations, others have only the lysogenic mutation. Cells without either mutation remain uninfected. So the total number of plumes depends on the proportion of cells with both mutations. \n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a mutation rate (say, \u03b1) and the normal phage has a mutation rate (\u03b2), the probability of both mutations is \u03b1\u03b2. However, in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage is present, so \u03b2 is zero (since lysogenic phages are single mutants). Therefore, in the first experiment, the number of plumes would depend solely on the lysogenic phage's mutation rate. \n\nBut in the second experiment, when both types are present, the cells with both mutations will lyse the E. coli, leading to more plumes. The ratio of plumes on strain K compared to strain B gives us information about the mutation rates. \n\nGiven that four plumes were found on strain K and 40 on strain B, we can infer that the number of cells with both mutations is much smaller than those with only lysogenic phages. So the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This implies that 10 times fewer cells have both mutations than have only lysogenic phages. \n\nAssuming that the mutation rates are independent, the fraction of cells with both mutations is \u03b1\u03b2. The fraction with only lysogenic is (1-\u03b1), and the fraction with only normal is (1-\u03b2). However, since \u03b2 is small (because lysogenic phages don't cause mutations in themselves), we can approximate the fraction of cells with both mutations as approximately \u03b1(1-\u03b2) \u2248 \u03b1. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B is \u03b1 : (1-\u03b1). Given that 40 plumes on B correspond to 1-\u03b1, and 4 plumes on K correspond to \u03b1. So \u03b1/(1-\u03b1) = 4/40 = 1/10. Solving this:\n\n\u03b1 = (1/10)(1 - \u03b1)\n10\u03b1 = 1 - \u03b1\n11\u03b1 = 1\n\u03b1 \u2248 1/11 \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 9%, so maybe my assumptions are off. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the number of cells plated is different. The first half is plated at 1:1e7, so 1e-7 M. The second half is plated at 1:1e5, so 1e-5 M. \n\nThe number of phages in the first half is N1 = C1 * n, where C1 is concentration (1e-7 M) and n is the number of cells plated. Similarly, N2 = C2 * n, where C2 is 1e-5 M. \n\nThe total number of phages is N_total = N1 + N2. The number of successful infections is N_total * p, where p is the probability of a phage carrying both mutations. \n\nThe number of plumes on strain B is proportional to the number of successful infections. So:\n\nPlumes_B = k * p * N1\nPlumes_K = k * p * N2\n\nWhere k is a constant of proportionality. Dividing Plumes_K / Plumes_B:\n\n(Plumes_K)/(Plumes_B) = (p * N2) / (p * N1) ) = N2/N1\n\nN2 is the number of phages plated on strain K (1e-5 M), N1 is 1e-7 M. So N2/N1 = (1e-5)/(1e-7) = 100. \n\nBut we observed Plumes_K = 4, Plumes_B = 40. So 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. But according to the calculation, it should be 100x. So discrepancy arises. Perhaps the assumption that both mutations are rare is incorrect. Alternatively, the actual ratio might be influenced by the exact mutation rates. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage was present, leading to complete death of cells, while in the second experiment, a mixture leads to some death. The number of plumes on strain K is 4, on B is 40. So the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the number of cells with both mutations is 1/10th of those with only the lysogenic phage. \n\nIf we assume that the mutation rates are such that the probability of both mutations is negligible, except when combined with the lysogenic phage, then the ratio would reflect the relative frequencies. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability of both mutations given the observed plume counts. \n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the concentrations are 1e-7 and 1e-5. The number of phages in each area is 1e-7 * n and 1e-5 * n, respectively. The number of successful infections is proportional to the product of the concentration and the number of phages. Thus, the number of plumes on B is proportional to (1e-7 * n) * (probability of lysogenic phage carrying both mutations). Similarly, on K, it's (1e-5 * n) * same probability. \n\nThus, Plumes_B / Plumes_K = (1e-7 / 1e-5) = 0.01, which is 1%. But our observation is 4 vs 40, giving 10%. So again, discrepancy. Maybe the actual probability is higher due to the presence of both types. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage's mutation causes the normal phage to become double mutant, the probability of both mutations is the product of the individual probabilities. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation rate \u03b1, and the normal phage has a mutation rate \u03b2, then the double mutant has probability \u03b1\u03b2. \n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage's mutation rate is higher than the normal phage's. From the experiment, when both are present, the number of plumes on K is much lower than on B. So the cells with double mutants are fewer than those with only lysogenic phages. \n\nLet\u2019s denote P_double = \u03b1\u03b2. The probability that a phage is only lysogenic is (1-\u03b1), only normal is (1-\u03b2). The total probability of any mutation is (1-\u03b1)(1-\u03b2) + \u03b1\u03b2 = 1 - \u03b1 - \u03b2 + 2\u03b1\u03b2. But in our case, most cells die, so probably only the double mutant survives. \n\nHowever, the observed number of plumes indicates that most cells die, suggesting that the double mutants are rare. So P_double is low, and (1-\u03b1)(1-\u03b2) is nearly 1. \n\nFrom the experiment, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 1/10, indicating that the number of cells with double mutants is 10% of those with only lysogenic phages. So the probability of a cell being a double mutant is 10% of being a single lysogenic. \n\nIf P_double = 0.1 * P_single, and P_single = (1-\u03b1), then 0.1*(1-\u03b1) = \u03b1\u03b2. Also, since the double mutants make the cells die, the overall survival rate is (1-P_double)*P_single + P_double*1 = (1 - 0.1*(1-\u03b1)) * (1-\u03b1) + 0.1*(1-\u03b1). But this seems complicated. Instead, focusing on the ratio: Plumes_K / Plumes_B = [\u03b1\u03b2 * (number of cells with both)] / [(1-\u03b1)*(number of cells with only lysogenic)] ] = [\u03b1\u03b2 * x] / [(1-\u03b1)x] = \u03b1\u03b2 / (1-\u03b1). We know this equals 4/40 = 0.1. So \u03b1\u03b2 / (1-\u03b1) = 0.1. \n\nAssuming that the mutation rates are small, so \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, then 1-\u03b1 \u2248 1, and \u03b1\u03b2 \u2248 0.1. But without knowing whether \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, this assumption might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, solving \u03b1\u03b2 = 0.1*(1-\u03b1). Let's suppose \u03b1 is 0.05, then \u03b2 = 0.1*(1-0.05)/0.05 = 0.1*0.95/0.05 = 0.18. So \u03b2\u224818%, which seems too high. Alternatively, if \u03b1 is 0.02, then \u03b2=0.1*(0.98)/0.02= 0.1*0.98/0.02=4.9. Still high. If \u03b1 is 0.01, \u03b2=0.1*(0.99)/0.01\u22489.9. Still high. If \u03b1 is 0.05, \u03b2=0.1*(0.95)/0.05=1.9. Still high. It seems like the required \u03b2 is quite high, around 20%, which might indicate a significant recombination. \n\nBut none of the options give a percentage above 20%. The highest option is F.0.3 percent. So perhaps my approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that the number of plumes relates to the square root of the product of the concentrations. Because the number of phages in each area is C * n, and the number of successful infections is proportional to sqrt(C1*C2), assuming Poisson statistics. \n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio of plumes would be sqrt((C1)/(C2)) = sqrt(1e-7 /1e-5)=sqrt(0.01)=0.1, which matches the 4/40=0.1 ratio. \n\nSo if the number of plumes is proportional to sqrt(C1*C2), then the ratio Plumes_K / Plumes_B = sqrt((C1/C2)) = sqrt(1e-7 /1e-5)=sqrt(0.01)=0.1. Which aligns with our observation. \n\nThis suggests that the relationship is multiplicative under square roots. So the product of the concentrations is proportional to the square of the number of plumes. \n\nBut this complicates things further. However, given the answer choices, and considering that the closest match to a moderate recombination rate (not extremely high) is perhaps G.0.5 percent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, thinking back, if the recombination frequency is r, then the probability that a phage has both mutations is r * p, where p is the mutation rate of the normal phage. If p is small, say 0.01, then r needs to be ~10% to get the observed plume ratio. But none of the options have exactly 10%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, implying that the probability of a phage being a double mutant is 1/10th of being a single lysogenic. If the double mutants have a probability of 1/10th of single lysogenic, and assuming that the mutations are independent, then the probability of double mutants is p*q = (\u03b1)(\u03b2). And the probability of single lysogenic is (1-\u03b1) + (1-\u03b2). But this line of reasoning is unclear. \n\nMaybe a simpler approach: The experiment showed that the presence of both types leads to a decrease in plumes on K compared to B",

    "rollout": " But wait, the first scenario says that when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. With both types present, only strain K shows issues, which implies that the lysogenic phages might be causing some effect, possibly through recombination. \n\nThe results showed that half of the population was plated at 1:10^7 (so fewer cells, less chance of infection), resulting in 40 plumes on strain B. The other half was plated at 1:10^5 (more cells, higher chance of infection), leading to 4 plumes on strain K. Hmm, wait, that seems counterintuitive because if you plate fewer cells, you should get fewer infections, but here the number of plumes on B is much higher than on K. That suggests that the half plated at 1:10^7 had higher recombination rates, meaning the phages were combining more effectively, perhaps causing more damage. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutations leads to some interference where only certain combinations cause disruption. \n\nWait, no, in the case of two mutant phages, when both are present, their interactions could affect replication. Maybe the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host DNA, creating a recombinant phage. In such cases, sometimes the phage has a better chance of infecting cells because the phage copy number increases. So if the lysogenic phage integrates, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to more successful infections when plated at lower concentrations. That would explain why the half plated at 1:10^7 had more plumes (higher recombination rate) compared to the half plated at 1:10^5. This suggests that the presence of both mutations increased the likelihood of successful infection due to the increase in phage copy number upon integration. \n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Since both mutations are involved in causing lytic fission (because strain B is affected), the recombination likely refers to whether the phages integrated into the host DNA. If the lysogenic phage integrated, then they would have a higher chance of replicating and infecting more cells, hence more plumes. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. However, when both are present, only strain K is affected. So that suggests that in the presence of lysogenic phages, strain B is affected, but when another mutation is present, like a different lysogenic phage or a recombined phage, strain K becomes susceptible. This indicates that the recombination occurs within the lysogenic phage, and when the other mutation is introduced, it disrupts the original phage, making the lysogenic phage ineffective against strain K. \n\nSo the key here is that the presence of both mutations allows the lysogenic phage to replicate better, leading to more successful infections when plated at lower concentrations. To quantify the recombination level, we need to calculate the fraction of double-stranded regions where the two mutations coexist. \n\nIn phage genetics, the effective number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by two mutations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEffective DSBs = n1 + n2 - n1*n2/(2^n)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the copy numbers of each mutation, and n is the number of plasmid copies available. However, in reality, when dealing with phages, especially in experiments, the calculation might simplify. Since both mutations are acting as lysogens, and assuming the same number of plasmids, the effective number of DSBs would depend on whether the two mutations are independent or not. \n\nAlternatively, the probability that two mutations occur together (recombination) can be estimated by comparing the observed frequency of double mutants to the expected frequency under random occurrence. In this case, without any recombination, the chance of having both mutations would be zero. However, in our experiment, both mutations happened together in the lysogenic phage, leading to increased efficiency. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the following approach: Assume that the expected number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If both mutations occurred together, the probability would be higher. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p1 as the proportion of cells where the first mutation occurs.\n- p2 as the proportion of cells where the second mutation occurs.\nAssuming independence, the probability of both occurring together is p1*p2. \n\nFrom the experiment, when both mutations are present, the effective DSBs are higher, indicating that the two mutations co-exist, leading to more efficient replication. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high. \n\nGiven that the result showed that when both mutations are present, only strain K was affected, implying that the combination caused a disruption, while strain B remained unaffected. This suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is significant enough to cause the lysogenic phage to become non-viable against strain K, but still affects strain B. \n\nTo estimate the percentage of recombination, we can consider that when the two mutations are present together, they create more efficient replication, leading to higher efficiency when plated at lower concentrations. Assuming that each mutation occurs at a certain frequency, the combined recombination would be the product of their individual frequencies. \n\nHowever, without exact data on the frequencies, it's challenging to compute the precise percentage. But given the options provided, and considering that the presence of both mutations led to a significant disruption, but not complete, the recombination level must be moderate. \n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest option is G (0.5%), followed by F (0.3%), then D (0.1%), C (1.5%), etc. Considering that the disruption is noticeable but not severe, a moderate recombination level might correspond to around 0.5% or slightly higher. \n\nBut wait, in phage experiments, often the recombination level is expressed as the percentage of double-stranded regions where the two mutations occur. For example, if the recombination frequency is 0.1%, that would imply that only 0.1% of the phages have both mutations. Conversely, if the recombination frequency is 0.5%, it means 0.5% of the phages have both mutations, but also considering that some phages may have only one mutation. \n\nAlternatively, the observed effect (strain K being susceptible) might indicate that the double mutant forms are viable, whereas the single mutants are not. This suggests that the double mutants are more common than the singles, which aligns with higher recombination levels. \n\nConsidering all this, and given the options, the most reasonable choice is likely G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since the disruption is noticeable but not complete, a recombination frequency of approximately 0.5% makes sense. \n\nWait, but looking again, the experiment showed that half the cells were plated at 1:1e7 (lower concentration, more plumes), and the other half at 1:1e5 (higher concentration, fewer plumes). But the actual counts were 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's a huge difference, suggesting that the half plated at 1:1e7 had more plumes. If the recombination increased the efficiency, then the presence of both mutations would make the phage more effective, leading to more plumes. \n\nTherefore, the recombination level must be sufficient to cause this increase. Without knowing the exact calculations, but considering the options, the closest plausible answer is probably G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Given that the effect is significant but not extreme, 0.5% seems reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. But wait, the first scenario says that when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. With both types present, only strain K shows issues, which implies that the lysogenic phages might be causing some effect, possibly through recombination. \n\nThe results showed that half of the population was plated at 1:10^7 (so fewer cells, less chance of infection), resulting in 40 plumes on strain B. The other half was plated at 1:10^5 (more cells, higher chance of infection), leading to 4 plumes on strain K. Hmm, wait, that seems counterintuitive because if you plate fewer cells, you should get fewer infections, but here the number of plumes on B is much higher than on K. That suggests that the half plated at 1:10^7 had higher recombination rates, meaning the phages were combining more effectively, perhaps causing more damage. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both mutations leads to some interference where only certain combinations cause disruption. \n\nWait, no, in the case of two mutant phages, when both are present, their interactions could affect replication. Maybe the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host DNA, creating a recombinant phage. In such cases, sometimes the phage has a better chance of infecting cells because the phage copy number increases. So if the lysogenic phage integrates, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to more successful infections when plated at lower concentrations. That would explain why the half plated at 1:10^7 had more plumes (higher recombination rate) compared to the half plated at 1:10^5. This suggests that the presence of both mutations increased the likelihood of successful infection due to the increase in phage copy number upon integration. \n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Since both mutations are involved in causing lytic fission (because strain B is affected), the recombination likely refers to whether the phages integrated into the host DNA. If the lysogenic phage integrated, then they would have a higher chance of replicating and infecting more cells, hence more plumes. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that when only lysogenic phages are present, strain B is affected. However, when both are present, only strain K is affected. So that suggests that in the presence of lysogenic phages, strain B is affected, but when another mutation is present, like a different lysogenic phage or a recombined phage, strain K becomes susceptible. This indicates that the recombination occurs within the lysogenic phage, and when the other mutation is introduced, it disrupts the original phage, making the lysogenic phage ineffective against strain K. \n\nSo the key here is that the presence of both mutations allows the lysogenic phage to replicate better, leading to more successful infections when plated at lower concentrations. To quantify the recombination level, we need to calculate the fraction of double-stranded regions where the two mutations coexist. \n\nIn phage genetics, the effective number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by two mutations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEffective DSBs = n1 + n2 - n1*n2/(2^n)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the copy numbers of each mutation, and n is the number of plasmid copies available. However, in reality, when dealing with phages, especially in experiments, the calculation might simplify. Since both mutations are acting as lysogens, and assuming the same number of plasmids, the effective number of DSBs would depend on whether the two mutations are independent or not. \n\nAlternatively, the probability that two mutations occur together (recombination) can be estimated by comparing the observed frequency of double mutants to the expected frequency under random occurrence. In this case, without any recombination, the chance of having both mutations would be zero. However, in our experiment, both mutations happened together in the lysogenic phage, leading to increased efficiency. \n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we can use the following approach: Assume that the expected number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If both mutations occurred together, the probability would be higher. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p1 as the proportion of cells where the first mutation occurs.\n- p2 as the proportion of cells where the second mutation occurs.\nAssuming independence, the probability of both occurring together is p1*p2. \n\nFrom the experiment, when both mutations are present, the effective DSBs are higher, indicating that the two mutations co-exist, leading to more efficient replication. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high. \n\nGiven that the result showed that when both mutations are present, only strain K was affected, implying that the combination caused a disruption, while strain B remained unaffected. This suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is significant enough to cause the lysogenic phage to become non-viable against strain K, but still affects strain B. \n\nTo estimate the percentage of recombination, we can consider that when the two mutations are present together, they create more efficient replication, leading to higher efficiency when plated at lower concentrations. Assuming that each mutation occurs at a certain frequency, the combined recombination would be the product of their individual frequencies. \n\nHowever, without exact data on the frequencies, it's challenging to compute the precise percentage. But given the options provided, and considering that the presence of both mutations led to a significant disruption, but not complete, the recombination level must be moderate. \n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest option is G (0.5%), followed by F (0.3%), then D (0.1%), C (1.5%), etc. Considering that the disruption is noticeable but not severe, a moderate recombination level might correspond to around 0.5% or slightly higher. \n\nBut wait, in phage experiments, often the recombination level is expressed as the percentage of double-stranded regions where the two mutations occur. For example, if the recombination frequency is 0.1%, that would imply that only 0.1% of the phages have both mutations. Conversely, if the recombination frequency is 0.5%, it means 0.5% of the phages have both mutations, but also considering that some phages may have only one mutation. \n\nAlternatively, the observed effect (strain K being susceptible) might indicate that the double mutant forms are viable, whereas the single mutants are not. This suggests that the double mutants are more common than the singles, which aligns with higher recombination levels. \n\nConsidering all this, and given the options, the most reasonable choice is likely G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Since the disruption is noticeable but not complete, a recombination frequency of approximately 0.5% makes sense. \n\nWait, but looking again, the experiment showed that half the cells were plated at 1:1e7 (lower concentration, more plumes), and the other half at 1:1e5 (higher concentration, fewer plumes). But the actual counts were 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That's a huge difference, suggesting that the half plated at 1:1e7 had more plumes. If the recombination increased the efficiency, then the presence of both mutations would make the phage more effective, leading to more plumes. \n\nTherefore, the recombination level must be sufficient to cause this increase. Without knowing the exact calculations, but considering the options, the closest plausible answer is probably G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Given that the effect is significant but not extreme, 0.5% seems reasonable.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Or wait, no\u2014strain B is primarily affected because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse it. So the presence of another mutation might affect its ability to infect strain B, causing more plumes. Alternatively, the interaction between the two mutations could lead to some effect where the combined presence leads to more or fewer infections than expected. \n\nWait, the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage is dominant. Now, looking at the results: half of the plates (let's say n) are plated on B and half on K. On B, 4 plumes are found; on K, 40. But wait, the initial division was into two equal parts, so each part has n/2 cells. Wait, maybe the dilutions are important here. The first group is diluted 1:10^7, so each well has 1 phage per 10^7 cells. The second group is 1:10^5, so each well has 1 phage per 10^5 cells. When you plate these on a lawn, the number of plumes depends on the density of the phage and the efficiency of replication. In a normal scenario without any interactions, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the phage concentrations and the efficiency of replication. However, if there's recombination between two mutations, it might increase or decrease the number of plumes. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage (which is the one that does damage to strain B) is more likely to replicate efficiently, while the lysogenic phage with another mutation might have reduced replication efficiency. So if both types are present, maybe the combination reduces the number of successful infections compared to just one mutation type. Or vice versa. \n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the two mutations are independent. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability of the first mutation occurring, q as the probability of the second mutation occurring. Since the mutations are mutually exclusive (a phage can\u2019t have both mutations unless there's recombination), the total probability of either mutation occurring is p + q. But wait, if there's recombination, then the probabilities might be related, such that q = p * r, where r is the rate of recombination. So the total recombination coefficient would be r, which is the fraction of cases where both mutations occur together.\n\nNow, the number of plumes observed is influenced by the replication efficiency of each phage. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage (mutation A) has replication efficiency \u03b1, and mutation B has replication efficiency \u03b2. With recombination, their efficiencies multiply, so the combined efficiency is \u03b1\u03b2. But wait, in reality, if the mutations are recombined, the effective efficiency becomes \u03b1\u03b2/(\u03b1 + \u03b2 - \u03b1\u03b2), assuming some interference. This complicates things, but perhaps we can simplify by considering that the presence of both mutations decreases the overall replication efficiency. \n\nWhen both mutations are present, the number of successful infections would depend on the product of their individual replication efficiencies. However, in our experiment, the outcome isn't clear-cut. Strain B shows a high number of plumes (40) relative to strain K (4). That suggests that strain B is more susceptible to the combined effects of both mutations. Alternatively, the presence of strain K's mutation might influence the outcome differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the dilution factors. If the first group is plated at 1:10^7, and the second at 1:10^5, the ratio of dilutions is 100:1. When you plate on strain B, the higher dilution factor allows more cells to be plated, potentially increasing the number of plumes. Similarly, on strain K, the lower dilution factor means more plumes. But why is there a difference?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple mutations might lead to less efficient replication, reducing the number of plumes. For example, if the lysogenic phage with a mutation has lower replication efficiency, it would replicate fewer times, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, the lysogenic phage without the mutation would replicate more efficiently. \n\nBut the main point is about the recombination between the two mutations. The recombination coefficient measures the degree of genetic linkage between two loci. It ranges from 0% (no recombination) to 100% (completely linked). The amount of recombination can be determined using the formula:\n\nr = (q - pq)/p\n\nwhere q is the frequency of the second mutation, and p is the frequency of the first mutation. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the percentage of recombinant alleles. But in this context, since the mutations are linked, the recombination coefficient would indicate how often the two mutations occur together. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage with one mutation is more likely to replicate efficiently, and the one without is less efficient, the presence of recombination might reduce the replication efficiency further. So, if both mutations are present, the combined efficiency is \u03b1\u03b2/(\u03b1 + \u03b2 - \u03b1\u03b2), but this is getting too detailed. Instead, perhaps the key is to determine the ratio of plumes and see how it relates to the recombination coefficient. \n\nLooking back at the data: On strain B, 4 plumes are found, whereas on strain K, 40 are found. If strain B is mostly affected, it might mean that the lysogenic phage with one mutation (the recombining one) is more efficient, thus resulting in fewer plumes. Conversely, strain K might have a different mutation that increases the replication efficiency, leading to more plumes. But wait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations, so perhaps the way they interact affects the number of plumes. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plumes is inversely related to the square root of the dilution factor. So, with a higher dilution factor, fewer plumes are expected because fewer cells are plated, making it harder to get enough phages to infect them. If both mutations are present, the combined effect might lead to a lower number of plumes than expected for either mutation alone. \n\nThe formula for the expected number of plumes under random dilution is N = (n)(p)(q), where n is the number of plasmids per cell. Assuming normal conditions, the number of plumes should be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. However, when mutations interfere, the effective number of plumes can change. \n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be N = n * (p + q). But if they are recombined, the effective number of plumes is reduced. The exact relationship depends on the degree of recombination. \n\nIn our case, since the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain K than on strain B, perhaps the recombination reduces the replication efficiency, leading to more plumes being detected on strain K. Alternatively, if the recombination is significant, the number of plumes might vary depending on which mutation is present. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the numbers. On strain B, 4 plumes are found, and on strain K, 40 are found. If the same number of plasmids were used on both strains, the higher number on K might suggest that the K strain's mutation contributes to more plumes. However, since both mutations are present, perhaps the recombination affects the replication efficiency, leading to more plumes on K. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of recombination might make the lysogenic phage with the mutation replicate more efficiently, leading to more plumes. So, if both mutations are present, the combined effect could lead to more plumes on the strain where the mutation with better replication efficiency is present. \n\nBut the question is about the recombination between the two mutations, not about their individual effects. To find the recombination coefficient, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (\u221a(N_B / N_K) - \u221a(N_B * N_K)) / (\u221a(N_B) + \u221a(N_K))\n\nWhere N_B is the number of plumes on strain B, and N_K is on strain K. Plugging in the values:\n\n\u221a(4/40) = \u221a(0.1) \u2248 0.316\n\n\u221a(4*40) = \u221a(160) \u2248 12.649\n\nSo,\n\nr = (0.316 - 12.649)/(0.316 + 12.649)\n\u2248 (-12.333)/(12.965)\n\u2248 -0.945\n\nThis negative value doesn't make sense because recombination coefficients are typically between 0 and 1. Maybe I applied the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nr = (N_B - N_K) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(N_K))^2)\n\nWait, that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\nr = (N_B - N_K) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(N_K))^2\n\nBut with the given numbers:\n\n(4 - 40) = -36\n\nsqrt(4)=2, sqrt(40)=6.324\n\nSum squared: (8)^2=64\n\nSo,\n\n-36 / 64 = -0.5625\n\nStill negative. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal. Maybe the correct approach is to look at the ratio of plumes and relate it to the recombination coefficient. Another way is to think about the ratio of replication efficiencies. Let\u2019s suppose that the replication efficiency of strain B (without mutation) is \u03b51, and strain K is \u03b52. When both mutations are present, the combined replication efficiency is \u03b51*\u03b52/(\u03b51 + \u03b52 - \u03b51*\u03b52). Then, the number of plumes would depend on this. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact replication efficiencies, this approach might not work. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the problem is about determining the recombination coefficient, and given the options, perhaps the answer is 0.5%, which is option G. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, thinking about the numbers, the higher number of plumes on K might suggest that K's mutation is contributing more to plume production, possibly due to better replication efficiency. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportionally higher for the one with better replication. But the presence of recombination could complicate this. \n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is D: 0.1 percent. Because when there's recombination, the efficiency drops, leading to fewer plumes, but in this case, strain B has fewer plumes, which might imply less recombination, or more. Wait, if recombination increased replication efficiency, then the number of plumes should increase, but here on B it's lower. So perhaps recombination decreased replication efficiency, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, the recombination coefficient would be low, around 0.1%. So the answer might be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Plugging in the values:\n\n\u221a(4/40) = \u221a(0.1) \u2248 0.316\n\n\u221a(4*40) = \u221a(160) \u2248 12.649\n\nSo,\n\nr = (0.316 - 12.649)/(0.316 + 12.649)\n\u2248 (-12.333)/(12.965)\n\u2248 -0.945\n\nThis negative value doesn't make sense because recombination coefficients are typically between 0 and 1. Maybe I applied the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nr = (N_B - N_K) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(N_K))^2)\n\nWait, that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\nr = (N_B - N_K) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(N_K))^2\n\nBut with the given numbers:\n\n(4 - 40) = -36\n\nsqrt(4)=2, sqrt(40)=6.324\n\nSum squared: (8)^2=64\n\nSo,\n\n-36 / 64 = -0.5625\n\nStill negative. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal. Maybe the correct approach is to look at the ratio of plumes and relate it to the recombination coefficient. Another way is to think about the ratio of replication efficiencies. Let\u2019s suppose that the replication efficiency of strain B (without mutation) is \u03b51, and strain K is \u03b52. When both mutations are present, the combined replication efficiency is \u03b51*\u03b52/(\u03b51 + \u03b52 - \u03b51*\u03b52). Then, the number of plumes would depend on this. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact replication efficiencies, this approach might not work. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the problem is about determining the recombination coefficient, and given the options, perhaps the answer is 0.5%, which is option G. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, thinking about the numbers, the higher number of plumes on K might suggest that K's mutation is contributing more to plume production, possibly due to better replication efficiency. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportionally higher for the one with better replication. But the presence of recombination could complicate this. \n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is D: 0.1 percent. Because when there's recombination, the efficiency drops, leading to fewer plumes, but in this case, strain B has fewer plumes, which might imply less recombination, or more. Wait, if recombination increased replication efficiency, then the number of plumes should increase, but here on B it's lower. So perhaps recombination decreased replication efficiency, leading to fewer plumes. Therefore, the recombination coefficient would be low, around 0.1%. So the answer might be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

The ones treated with 1:1e7 were plated on strain B's lawn, and those with 1:1e5 were plated on strain K's lawn. The number of plumes (infections) depends on the phage concentration. Since the first group had a higher dilution factor, each plasmid would be more likely to infect the target bacteria. However, the second group was treated with a lower dilution factor, meaning each plasmid has a higher chance of infecting the target. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you dilute the phage solution, a higher dilution factor means fewer plasmids are present in each well. For example, 1:1e7 means 1 phage per 1e7 cells, so each cell has a much lower chance of being infected. Conversely, 1:1e5 means each cell has a higher chance of being infected because there are more phages. Now, in the experiment, the first half was plated on strain B's lawn. So any phages that were present at low concentrations (due to high dilution) might lead to infections on strain B. Similarly, the second half was plated on strain K's lawn, where phages at even lower concentrations could cause infections. The key here is that if the two mutation types interact, perhaps their frequencies affect each other. \n\nIn the end, the majority of the colonies (the highest concentration) show a certain number of plumes. The fact that all of strain B showed less plumes than strain K suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage mutation leads to increased susceptibility or higher expression of the lysogenic variant. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is expressed more due to the interaction with the lysogenic phage, then more phages would be present, leading to more infections. But wait, in the experiment, the lysogenic phage is causing the issue, so why do both strains get affected? Maybe the combination leads to a synergistic effect where both types are expressed, leading to more infections overall. \n\nBut going back to the data. On strain B's lawn, the plumes were 4, and on strain K's lawn, they were 40. That seems like a big difference. Wait, no, because the plumes represent individual infections. If strain B has fewer plumes, that might indicate that the lysogenic phage is expressing more, making it more likely to infect strain B. Strain K, on the other hand, has more plumes, indicating that either the lysogenic phage isn't as effective against it, or perhaps the lysogenic phage is being suppressed or the phage population is different. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple mutants might lead to a phenomenon called \"recombination,\" where the two phage variants interact to produce a new phage that affects both strains. This would increase the number of plumes because both types are expressed more effectively together. However, in this case, the number of plumes on strain B is lower, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more dominant or that the lysogenic phage is not being expressed enough to infect strain B as effectively. \n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage is expressed more in strain K, that might mean that the lysogenic phage is a better stressor, leading to more infections. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage is being expressed more in strain K, making it a worse stressor for strain B, hence fewer infections. \n\nLet me try to model this mathematically. Suppose we denote the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation as p and the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation in the T_4 genome as q. The expected number of plumes would depend on the product of these frequencies, assuming some form of interference. However, in reality, there's often a lot of epistasis, where the expression of one mutation affects the expression of another. \n\nIf the two mutations interfere, such as one being suppressive of the other, the total expression would be the sum minus the product. In this case, suppose the lysogenic phage is expressed more in strain K, leading to more infections. The total expression would be p + q - pq. \n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain K is 40, and on strain B is 4, I can set up equations based on the expected number of plumes. Let\u2019s assume that without considering any interference, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the frequencies. But in reality, the observed number is influenced by interactions. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact mathematical relationship, it's tricky. Instead, let's consider the ratio of plumes. The observed plumes on strain K are 10 times more than on strain B. If the actual expression is additive without any interference, then the frequencies should satisfy p + q = 10*(number of plumes), but that might not hold exactly. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the lysogenic phage increases the susceptibility, the number of plumes would reflect the combined expression. If the two mutations are independent, the probability that both occur is p*q. Therefore, the expected number of plumes would be related to p*q. But in practice, the observed number may be higher due to some form of synergy. \n\nWait, another approach: the number of plumes indicates the concentration of phages. If strain B shows fewer plumes, that implies lower concentration or less phage activity. Conversely, strain K shows higher concentration, meaning more phages, which could be because the lysogenic phage is expressed more in strain K, leading to more infections. \n\nBut how does this relate to the recombination frequency? Recombination refers to the proportion of double mutant alleles. If the two mutations interact, their occurrence is linked, meaning they are inherited together. The recombination frequency (rf) is usually measured in percentage, representing the fraction of individuals where both mutations occur. \n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is R%, the number of double mutants would be approximately (1 - R/100) * total population. However, in this context, the phage mutations' frequencies determine the likelihood of their co-inhibition or co-excitation. \n\nLet me make an assumption: If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to their product. But in reality, they might be interacting, so the observed number is higher or lower depending on whether they are synergistic or antagonistic. \n\nSuppose the two mutations are interactive and synergistic. Then the combined effect is greater than the sum of individual effects. Therefore, the number of plumes would be higher when both mutations are present. But in our case, strain B shows fewer plumes, which contradicts this idea. Alternatively, if they are antagonistic, the combined effect is less than the sum. \n\nWait, but in our experiment, the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain K, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is more active in strain K, possibly because the lysogenic phage is expressed more under certain conditions. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can estimate the product of the allele frequencies. Suppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation is x in strain B and y in strain K. The observed number of plumes relates to x*y. \n\nFrom the experiment:\n- On strain B, plumes = 4.\n- On strain K, plumes = 40.\n\nThe ratio of plumes is 4:40 = 1:10. If the number of plumes is proportional to x*y, then:\n\nx_B * y_K / (x_K * y_B) = 40/4 = 10.\n\nSo, (x_B / x_K) * (y_K / y_B) = 10.\n\nAssuming that the allele frequencies are similar across the two strains, say x_B \u2248 x_K = x, and y_K \u2248 y_B = y, then:\n\n(x/y)^2 = 10 => x/y = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency R is given by:\n\nR = [1 - (x/y)] * 100% \u2248 (1 - 3.16)% \u2192 negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the frequencies are inversely related. Let me rethink.\n\nIf the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies, then:\n\nplumes_B / plumes_K = (x_B * y_B) / (x_K * y_K).\n\nWe know plumes_B = 4, plumes_K = 40.\n\nAlso, from earlier, (x_B / x_K) * (y_K / y_B) = 10.\n\nAssuming that x_B = x_K = x, and y_K = y_B = y, then:\n\n(y_K / y_B) = (y_B / y_K)\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(x\u00b2)(y\u00b2)\u207b\u00b9 = 10 => x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 = 10 => (x/y)\u00b2 = 10 => x/y = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16.\n\nThus,\n\n(R%) = (1 - x/y) * 100% \u2248 (1 - 3.16)*100% \u2248 -216%, which is impossible. So my initial assumption must be wrong. Perhaps the product is inversely related?\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is plumes \u221d x * y. So:\n\nplumes_B / plumes_K = (x_B * y_B) / (x_K * y_K).\n\nGiven x_B = x_K = x, and y_K = y_B = y, then:\n\n4 / 40 = (x * y) / (x * y) = 1. Which is not possible. Thus, my initial assumption that the allele frequencies are the same in both strains is incorrect. \n\nLet me instead define variables:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the lysogenic phage in strain B.\n\nLet y be the frequency of the lysogenic phage in strain K.\n\nThen, the number of plumes on strain B would be proportional to x * y, and on strain K, proportional to y * x (since strain K's plume count is higher). Wait, that would suggest x * y = 4 and x * y = 40, which again leads to inconsistency unless x * y varies. But in reality, x and y are fixed; their product determines the plume counts. \n\nThis suggests that the observed change in plume numbers cannot happen unless the frequencies are changing, which they aren't. Therefore, perhaps the interaction is affecting the total expression, leading to a different relationship. \n\nAnother angle: If the two mutations are linked, their recombination frequency R is the proportion of double mutant alleles. The expected number of double mutants would be (1 - R) * N, where N is the total population. But in terms of plumes, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes corresponds to the concentration of phages. If strain B has a lower concentration of phages, fewer plumes, and strain K has a higher concentration, more plumes. But how does the recombination frequency come into play here? Recombination frequency relates to the likelihood of having both mutations in an individual, affecting gene expression. If both mutations are expressed together, it could influence the concentration of phages, thus affecting the plume count.\n\nBut without more information on how the plume count relates directly to the recombination frequency, it's challenging. However, looking at the options provided, the most reasonable answer is 0.1% or 0.02%. Given that the plume counts are quite different\u2014only four vs. forty\u2014the interaction must be significant. \n\nRecombinant events are rare, so a small recombination frequency would lead to a large number of double mutants. If R is around 0.1%, then most individuals have neither mutation, leading to a lower concentration of phages, resulting in fewer plumes. Conversely, individuals with both mutations would have higher concentrations, leading to more plumes. \n\nConsidering the observed results, if strain B has fewer plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is not being expressed efficiently in strain B, which might indicate a higher recombination frequency. However, the opposite also holds true. If strain K has more plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is being expressed more efficiently in strain K, implying a lower recombination frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the measure of how often both mutations occur together. If the mutations interfere, the recombination frequency decreases, meaning fewer double mutants. More double mutants would lead to higher expression of both mutations, thereby increasing the concentration of phages. \n\nLooking at the options, 0.1% and 0.02% are very low, implying almost no recombination. However, the problem states that both mutations are present, so recombination must exist somewhere. \n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are completely independent, the recombination frequency would be zero. But the experiment shows a significant difference, so recombination must be happening. \n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is D. 0.05% or F. 0.3%. Considering that the number of plumes on strain K is significantly higher, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is being expressed more in strain K, which might imply a higher recombination frequency. \n\nHowever, without precise calculations, it's hard to choose definitively. But among the options, 0.05% and 0.3% seem more plausible than the others. \n\nI'm leaning towards option D. 0.05% because it's a common value in genetic experiments, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option F. 0.3% might be closer to the observed difference. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll go with F. 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

If R is around 0.1%, then most individuals have neither mutation, leading to a lower concentration of phages, resulting in fewer plumes. Conversely, individuals with both mutations would have higher concentrations, leading to more plumes. \n\nConsidering the observed results, if strain B has fewer plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is not being expressed efficiently in strain B, which might indicate a higher recombination frequency. However, the opposite also holds true. If strain K has more plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is being expressed more efficiently in strain K, implying a lower recombination frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the measure of how often both mutations occur together. If the mutations interfere, the recombination frequency decreases, meaning fewer double mutants. More double mutants would lead to higher expression of both mutations, thereby increasing the concentration of phages. \n\nLooking at the options, 0.1% and 0.02% are very low, implying almost no recombination. However, the problem states that both mutations are present, so recombination must exist somewhere. \n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are completely independent, the recombination frequency would be zero. But the experiment shows a significant difference, so recombination must be happening. \n\nGiven the options, the most plausible answer is D. 0.05% or F. 0.3%. Considering that the number of plumes on strain K is significantly higher, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is being expressed more in strain K, which might imply a higher recombination frequency. \n\nHowever, without precise calculations, it's hard to choose definitively. But among the options, 0.05% and 0.3% seem more plausible than the others. \n\nI'm leaning towards option D. 0.05% because it's a common value in genetic experiments, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option F. 0.3% might be closer to the observed difference. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll go with F. 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage.

Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse and kills the cell, while the lytic phage does lyse and creates new phage particles. If both types are present, maybe their combination leads to double-lysis or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage (which has a mutation that allows it to replicate without lyosis) competes with the lytic phage (which might have another mutation), leading to preferential attachment or something like that. Or maybe it's about the production of recombinases or something involved in the phage genome.\n\nThe key here is the number of plasmids detected. In the first half, they're plated on strain B's lawn, and half of them resulted in 40 plumes. On the other half, they're plated on strain K's lawn, and they got 4 plumes. So the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. That's interesting because usually, you'd expect the number of plasmids to be proportional to the dilution factor, but here it's much lower than expected. Maybe because the strain isn't susceptible, or perhaps the experiment design caused some interference.\n\nLet me recall what recombination refers to. Recombination between two mutations would lead to a situation where the resulting phage has characteristics from both original mutations. If both mutations are present, and they recombine, the resulting phage might have a different fitness compared to each parent. However, in this case, the presence of both types might cause interference in the detection of certain events. Maybe when both types are present, the phages interfere with each other, reducing the chance of detecting their own mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, the high dilution (1e7) plate had fewer plumes, meaning fewer infections occurred despite the same number of phages. This could indicate that the presence of one type reduces the probability of the other being detected. So if you have both types, the interactions might reduce the number of independent mutations you detect. This is similar to the idea of interference in genetic testing, where the presence of one allele affects the likelihood of another allele being observed.\n\nNow, considering the possible recombination rates. The options given are percentages ranging from 0.01% to 5%. To determine the exact value, I need to relate the number of plumes detected to the potential recombination rate. Each plume corresponds to an infection event, which depends on the phage's ability to infect the host. If the mutations allow the phages to integrate into the phage genome, the resulting phages might have altered lysogenicity. But in this scenario, it seems that the presence of both types affects the outcome differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes relates to the number of recombinants produced. For example, if there's a certain percentage of the phages that have integrated the mutations, this would influence the overall infection efficiency. But I'm not sure how to directly map the number of plumes to the recombination rate.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the concept of interference. Interference occurs when the occurrence of one event (like a mutation) affects the probability of another event occurring nearby. In the experiment, the presence of both mutation types might interfere with each other, leading to fewer plumes being detected. The degree of interference can be quantified, and this might correspond to the recombination fraction.\n\nIf we assume that the recombination fraction is the proportion of recombinant offspring, then the number of plumes detected can help us estimate this. However, I'm not entirely sure how to calculate the recombination fraction from the number of plumes. It might involve knowing the initial probabilities of each mutation and combining them based on recombination.\n\nGiven the results, there are 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B. Strain K is the parent strain, and strain B is the one that has been affected by the lysogenic phage. The higher number on B suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't cause as many infections there, possibly due to interference. Alternatively, the presence of both types might cause the lysogenic phage to die more easily, or the lysogeny might prevent the phage from replicating efficiently.\n\nTo find the recombination rate, I might need to use the formula for interference. The coefficient of coincidence (CI) is calculated as the observed coincidence divided by the expected coincidence. The expected coincidence is the product of the probabilities of each event. However, I don't know the exact values of the probabilities here.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of plumes indicates that the presence of the lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of its own mutation being detected, this could suggest that they recombine partially or completely. The exact calculation might require knowing the relative frequencies before and after the recombination.\n\nSince the problem asks for the amount of recombination, and the answer choices are small percentages, I suspect that the correct answer is likely a very low percentage, such as option D (0.1%) or F (0.3%). Given that the number of plumes on B is four times that on K, it suggests a moderate level of interference. If the interference is significant, the recombination rate might be around 1-3%, which would align with options C (1.5%) or G (0.5%).\n\nBut without precise calculations, it's hard to say exactly. However, considering the numbers, a recombination rate of 0.1% or 0.5% seems plausible.

    "rollout": " In lytic fission phages, the phage replicates within the host, causing lysis. In lysogenic phages, the phage integrates into the host DNA, leading to replication without lysing the host. So combining these might lead to something like a recombinant phage that can either lyse or replicate, depending on conditions. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutants are present, only strain B gets affected. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage would cause lysis, which should be more effective than the lytic one. But why isn't strain K getting affected? Maybe the combination leads to a different outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple phages leads to competition or interference in the infection process.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This seems like a high ratio. In bacterial experiments, ratios around 1:10 often indicate significant interaction or recombination. For example, if two phages interact, their combined effect can sometimes double or triple the probability of an infection, depending on the specifics. So a ratio of 1:10 suggests that they interacted significantly.\n\nNow, I need to relate this ratio to the percentage of recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material from different sources. In phages, especially T_4, the recombination site is typically near the integration site. The number of plasmid copies or the presence of certain mutations can influence whether a phage integrates or replicates.\n\nIf the two mutations in T_4 overlap or are adjacent, recombination could occur. The exact number of plasmids that cross-react could determine how much of a \"double\" or \"triple\" system is formed. Each additional plasmid increases the likelihood of recombination. \n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes indicates the effectiveness of each phage type. Since both are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is good for E. coli) causes more severe effects. But the fact that only strain B is affected implies that the lysogenic phage's activity is dominant, possibly due to the phage having integrated into the host before being released. However, the presence of the lytic phage complicates things because it would also lyse the bacteria, leading to more lysogeny.\n\nBut wait, the question asks specifically about the recombination between the two mutations. So we're looking for how much of the phage's genetic material has been shuffled by the presence of the other phage. If the two mutations are far apart, there's less recombination. If they're close, more.\n\nThe standard test for recombination in phages is the \"double phage\" assay, where two phages are mixed together. The number of double phages depends on how much recombination occurred. A double phage is considered recombinant if more than 10% of the phages share genetic material with another phage.\n\nGiven the ratio of plumes, which is 1:10, this is a strong indicator of significant recombination. Typically, a 10:1 ratio corresponds to recombination events that produce more than 10% of double phages. So, recombination must have occurred, but how much?\n\nEach additional plasmid copy beyond the first can contribute to recombination. If the two mutations are just adjacent, then a 1:1 ratio indicates no recombination. As recombination increases, the ratio decreases. To reach a 1:10 ratio, we'd need a significant degree of recombination.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of double phages, N = n(n-1)/2 * (recombination frequency), where n is the number of phages. Here, n is large because we're dealing with plating concentrations, so approximating, the expected number of double phages is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two phages. \n\nWait, but in our case, both phages are being plated separately. So the total number of double phages would depend on how much recombination occurs. But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:\n\nRecombination frequency = 1 - (number of non-recombined phages / total phages)\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the expected number of double phages is given by:\n\nN_double = n1 * n2 * r\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the concentrations of the two phages, and r is the recombination frequency (a fraction between 0 and 1).\n\nAssuming n1 and n2 are large (since we're using high concentrations), the ratio of double phages to total phages would be approximately r. Therefore, the ratio of double phages to non-double phages is roughly r/(1-r). But in our case, the ratio of plumes is 1:10, suggesting that most of the phages are non-recombinant, meaning r is low.\n\nAlternatively, considering that a 1:10 ratio is equivalent to a log(10) change in plasmid count, which relates to the logarithm of the recombination rate. The standard assumption is that a log(10) change in plasmid counts corresponds to a 50% increase in recombination frequency. So a 1:10 ratio would imply a log(10)(1/10) = -1, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of 10^{-(-1)} = 10^{+1} = 10, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recall the formula: The probability of recombination (r) can be estimated from the ratio of double phages to non-double phages. The formula is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nSo for a 1:10 ratio, n1 = 1, n2=10. Then,\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (1 + 10)/10 = 1.1 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{0.1} \u2248 1.26.\n\nWait, that can't be right because a 1:10 ratio should correspond to a lower recombination frequency. Maybe I inverted the formula. Let me check again.\n\nI think the correct formula is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nSo for a 1:10 ratio (n1=1, n2=10):\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (1 + 10)/10 = 1.1 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{0.1} \u2248 1.26.\n\nThis suggests a very high recombination frequency, which contradicts the idea that a 1:10 ratio implies moderate recombination. Hmm, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the correct relationship is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nWhich would suggest that as n1 and n2 increase, the log recombination becomes positive, indicating high recombination. But in reality, a 1:10 ratio is often associated with moderate recombination frequencies, say around 10-20%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that a 1:10 ratio implies that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, because a 1:10 ratio is similar to the ratio observed in natural recombination events. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that a 1:10 ratio is equivalent to a log(10) change of 1, which is a doubling of the probability of recombination. If the default expectation is a 50% increase in recombination frequency, then a 1:10 ratio would correspond to a 10-fold increase, which is much higher than typical. This suggests that maybe the actual recombination frequency is lower, perhaps around 1%.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match is option D: 0.1 percent, which is 1%. But wait, none of the options go down to 0.1 percent; the smallest is E: 0.05 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs adjustment.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try again. The standard method uses the ratio of double phages to non-double phages:\n\nNumber of double phages = C(n1,2) * C(n2,2) * r\n\nTotal phages = C(n1,2) + C(n2,2) + ... etc.\n\nBut for large n1 and n2, this simplifies to:\n\nDouble phages / Total phages \u2248 r\n\nTherefore, if the ratio of double phages to total phages is 1:10, then r \u2248 10%.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio of plumes is 4:40, which is 1:10. Assuming that all non-doubles are 10 times more frequent than doubles, then the recombination frequency r is approximately 10%.\n\nBut none of the answer choices go up to 10%. The highest is F: 0.5 percent. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is interpreted differently. If the ratio is 1:10, it might mean that only 10% of the phages are double systems, implying that 90% are non-double. Using the same formula:\n\nDouble phages / Non-double phages = r\n\nSo 10% / 90% = 1/9 \u2248 0.111.\n\nThen, taking the log base 10:\n\nlog10(1/9) \u2248 -0.954 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{-0.954} \u2248 0.111.\n\nThis corresponds to a recombination frequency of about 11%, which still doesn't align with any of the given options except perhaps rounding to 10%, but that's not an option. The closest lower option is F: 0.5 percent, but that's too low.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Another source says that the number of recombination events (r) can be calculated as:\n\nr = (n1 * n2 * ln(10)) / (10^(n1 + n2))\n\nFor small numbers, this approximation works. But with large n1 and n2, it's tricky. Alternatively, for a ratio of 1:10, using the rule of thumb that a 1:10 ratio corresponds to a 1% recombination frequency.\n\nBut given the options, 1% is closer to option D: 0.1 percent, but that's too low. Alternatively, maybe the formula requires a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a simpler way. The experiment shows that the presence of both mutations leads to only strain B being affected. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage enhances the effect of the lysogenic phage, potentially through recombination. If the two mutations are close together, recombination would enhance the lysogenic activity, making it more effective against strain B.\n\nThe ratio of plumes (1:10) suggests that the recombination is occurring. If the recombination frequency is x percent, then the expected number of double phages would be proportional to x. Given that, and knowing that a 1:10 ratio is often linked to moderate recombination (around 10%), but the options don't include 10%. The closest is option G: 0.5 percent, but that's too low. Option H: 0.02 percent is even lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the presence of both mutations causes only strain B to be affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is dominating. If the recombination were complete (100%), the lysogenic phage would not affect strain B. Instead, it would integrate entirely into the host. But the presence of the lysogenic phage (dies upon replication) allows it to replicate inside the host and lyse it, regardless of its genetic material. Therefore, the lysogenic phage's activity would dominate, and any recombination would not fully explain the difference.\n\nHowever, the experiment shows that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage's activity is sufficient to kill the E. coli in strain B despite the presence of the lysogenic phage itself. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has effectively replicated and integrated into the host, leading to lysogenic fission, rather than the phage integrating and replicating, which would require more precise genetic matches.\n\nThus, the recombination must have occurred such that the lysogenic phage can replicate without requiring precise genetic compatibility. This is possible when the two mutations are close enough that partial recombination still allows the phage to integrate and replicate.\n\nThe recombination frequency would thus be moderate, perhaps around 10%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is the lowest available, which is F: 0.5 percent. However, 10% is not among the options, and the closest is F: 0.5 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the ratio of plumes suggests a 1:10 ratio, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of 10%, but since that's not an option, the closest is F: 0.5 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested that a 1:10 ratio corresponds to about 10% recombination frequency, but since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is F: 0.5 percent, assuming a misunderstanding in the ratio interpretation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In lytic fission phages, the phage replicates within the host, causing lysis. In lysogenic phages, the phage integrates into the host DNA, leading to replication without lysing the host. So combining these might lead to something like a recombinant phage that can either lyse or replicate, depending on conditions. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both mutants are present, only strain B gets affected. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage would cause lysis, which should be more effective than the lytic one. But why isn't strain K getting affected? Maybe the combination leads to a different outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple phages leads to competition or interference in the infection process.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This seems like a high ratio. In bacterial experiments, ratios around 1:10 often indicate significant interaction or recombination. For example, if two phages interact, their combined effect can sometimes double or triple the probability of an infection, depending on the specifics. So a ratio of 1:10 suggests that they interacted significantly.\n\nNow, I need to relate this ratio to the percentage of recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic material from different sources. In phages, especially T_4, the recombination site is typically near the integration site. The number of plasmid copies or the presence of certain mutations can influence whether a phage integrates or replicates.\n\nIf the two mutations in T_4 overlap or are adjacent, recombination could occur. The exact number of plasmids that cross-react could determine how much of a \"double\" or \"triple\" system is formed. Each additional plasmid increases the likelihood of recombination. \n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes indicates the effectiveness of each phage type. Since both are present, the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is good for E. coli) causes more severe effects. But the fact that only strain B is affected implies that the lysogenic phage's activity is dominant, possibly due to the phage having integrated into the host before being released. However, the presence of the lytic phage complicates things because it would also lyse the bacteria, leading to more lysogeny.\n\nBut wait, the question asks specifically about the recombination between the two mutations. So we're looking for how much of the phage's genetic material has been shuffled by the presence of the other phage. If the two mutations are far apart, there's less recombination. If they're close, more.\n\nThe standard test for recombination in phages is the \"double phage\" assay, where two phages are mixed together. The number of double phages depends on how much recombination occurred. A double phage is considered recombinant if more than 10% of the phages share genetic material with another phage.\n\nGiven the ratio of plumes, which is 1:10, this is a strong indicator of significant recombination. Typically, a 10:1 ratio corresponds to recombination events that produce more than 10% of double phages. So, recombination must have occurred, but how much?\n\nEach additional plasmid copy beyond the first can contribute to recombination. If the two mutations are just adjacent, then a 1:1 ratio indicates no recombination. As recombination increases, the ratio decreases. To reach a 1:10 ratio, we'd need a significant degree of recombination.\n\nUsing the formula for the expected number of double phages, N = n(n-1)/2 * (recombination frequency), where n is the number of phages. Here, n is large because we're dealing with plating concentrations, so approximating, the expected number of double phages is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two phages. \n\nWait, but in our case, both phages are being plated separately. So the total number of double phages would depend on how much recombination occurs. But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:\n\nRecombination frequency = 1 - (number of non-recombined phages / total phages)\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the expected number of double phages is given by:\n\nN_double = n1 * n2 * r\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the concentrations of the two phages, and r is the recombination frequency (a fraction between 0 and 1).\n\nAssuming n1 and n2 are large (since we're using high concentrations), the ratio of double phages to total phages would be approximately r. Therefore, the ratio of double phages to non-double phages is roughly r/(1-r). But in our case, the ratio of plumes is 1:10, suggesting that most of the phages are non-recombinant, meaning r is low.\n\nAlternatively, considering that a 1:10 ratio is equivalent to a log(10) change in plasmid count, which relates to the logarithm of the recombination rate. The standard assumption is that a log(10) change in plasmid counts corresponds to a 50% increase in recombination frequency. So a 1:10 ratio would imply a log(10)(1/10) = -1, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of 10^{-(-1)} = 10^{+1} = 10, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recall the formula: The probability of recombination (r) can be estimated from the ratio of double phages to non-double phages. The formula is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nSo for a 1:10 ratio, n1 = 1, n2=10. Then,\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (1 + 10)/10 = 1.1 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{0.1} \u2248 1.26.\n\nWait, that can't be right because a 1:10 ratio should correspond to a lower recombination frequency. Maybe I inverted the formula. Let me check again.\n\nI think the correct formula is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nSo for a 1:10 ratio (n1=1, n2=10):\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (1 + 10)/10 = 1.1 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{0.1} \u2248 1.26.\n\nThis suggests a very high recombination frequency, which contradicts the idea that a 1:10 ratio implies moderate recombination. Hmm, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the correct relationship is:\n\nlog10(r) \u2248 (n1 + n2) / 10\n\nWhich would suggest that as n1 and n2 increase, the log recombination becomes positive, indicating high recombination. But in reality, a 1:10 ratio is often associated with moderate recombination frequencies, say around 10-20%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that a 1:10 ratio implies that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, because a 1:10 ratio is similar to the ratio observed in natural recombination events. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that a 1:10 ratio is equivalent to a log(10) change of 1, which is a doubling of the probability of recombination. If the default expectation is a 50% increase in recombination frequency, then a 1:10 ratio would correspond to a 10-fold increase, which is much higher than typical. This suggests that maybe the actual recombination frequency is lower, perhaps around 1%.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match is option D: 0.1 percent, which is 1%. But wait, none of the options go down to 0.1 percent; the smallest is E: 0.05 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs adjustment.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try again. The standard method uses the ratio of double phages to non-double phages:\n\nNumber of double phages = C(n1,2) * C(n2,2) * r\n\nTotal phages = C(n1,2) + C(n2,2) + ... etc.\n\nBut for large n1 and n2, this simplifies to:\n\nDouble phages / Total phages \u2248 r\n\nTherefore, if the ratio of double phages to total phages is 1:10, then r \u2248 10%.\n\nBut the problem states that the ratio of plumes is 4:40, which is 1:10. Assuming that all non-doubles are 10 times more frequent than doubles, then the recombination frequency r is approximately 10%.\n\nBut none of the answer choices go up to 10%. The highest is F: 0.5 percent. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is interpreted differently. If the ratio is 1:10, it might mean that only 10% of the phages are double systems, implying that 90% are non-double. Using the same formula:\n\nDouble phages / Non-double phages = r\n\nSo 10% / 90% = 1/9 \u2248 0.111.\n\nThen, taking the log base 10:\n\nlog10(1/9) \u2248 -0.954 \u2192 r \u2248 10^{-0.954} \u2248 0.111.\n\nThis corresponds to a recombination frequency of about 11%, which still doesn't align with any of the given options except perhaps rounding to 10%, but that's not an option. The closest lower option is F: 0.5 percent, but that's too low.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Another source says that the number of recombination events (r) can be calculated as:\n\nr = (n1 * n2 * ln(10)) / (10^(n1 + n2))\n\nFor small numbers, this approximation works. But with large n1 and n2, it's tricky. Alternatively, for a ratio of 1:10, using the rule of thumb that a 1:10 ratio corresponds to a 1% recombination frequency.\n\nBut given the options, 1% is closer to option D: 0.1 percent, but that's too low. Alternatively, maybe the formula requires a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a simpler way. The experiment shows that the presence of both mutations leads to only strain B being affected. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage enhances the effect of the lysogenic phage, potentially through recombination. If the two mutations are close together, recombination would enhance the lysogenic activity, making it more effective against strain B.\n\nThe ratio of plumes (1:10) suggests that the recombination is occurring. If the recombination frequency is x percent, then the expected number of double phages would be proportional to x. Given that, and knowing that a 1:10 ratio is often linked to moderate recombination (around 10%), but the options don't include 10%. The closest is option G: 0.5 percent, but that's too low. Option H: 0.02 percent is even lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the presence of both mutations causes only strain B to be affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is dominating. If the recombination were complete (100%), the lysogenic phage would not affect strain B. Instead, it would integrate entirely into the host. But the presence of the lysogenic phage (dies upon replication) allows it to replicate inside the host and lyse it, regardless of its genetic material. Therefore, the lysogenic phage's activity would dominate, and any recombination would not fully explain the difference.\n\nHowever, the experiment shows that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage's activity is sufficient to kill the E. coli in strain B despite the presence of the lysogenic phage itself. This suggests that the lysogenic phage has effectively replicated and integrated into the host, leading to lysogenic fission, rather than the phage integrating and replicating, which would require more precise genetic matches.\n\nThus, the recombination must have occurred such that the lysogenic phage can replicate without requiring precise genetic compatibility. This is possible when the two mutations are close enough that partial recombination still allows the phage to integrate and replicate.\n\nThe recombination frequency would thus be moderate, perhaps around 10%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is the lowest available, which is F: 0.5 percent. However, 10% is not among the options, and the closest is F: 0.5 percent. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the ratio of plumes suggests a 1:10 ratio, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of 10%, but since that's not an option, the closest is F: 0.5 percent.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations suggested that a 1:10 ratio corresponds to about 10% recombination frequency, but since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is F: 0.5 percent, assuming a misunderstanding in the ratio interpretation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": " The key point here is recombination\u2014when two mutations occur in the same gene, they can either work together or oppose each other. In this case, the phage might cause the DNA to be packaged differently depending on which mutation is present. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both types are present, only half of the bacteria show the effect (lyses), while the other half don't. That suggests that the presence of both mutations leads to some sort of interference where their effects cancel each other out. This interference is often referred to as the 'recombination' phenomenon. Recombination would mean that the mutations work against each other, leading to less than expected lysis. The number of plumes indicates how much of each type was effective. \n\nSo, the data given: one half with 4 plumes (probably 4 events of lytic infection) and the other half with 40 plumes. Since the first half has fewer plumes, it must contain the lysogenic phage because its effect was seen in both halves but at different concentrations. The second half, having more plumes, likely contains the phage that doesn't lyse the cell. Now, why did the first half have fewer plumes? Because the lysogenic phage is active, causing lytic fission, which should kill the bacteria. However, in this case, only a small number (4) were observed, meaning the lysogenic phage didn't cause enough damage. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage caused enough damage in the second half (40 plumes), indicating that the lysogenic phage is functional. \n\nWait, no, that seems conflicting. If the lysogenic phage is functional, it should cause more plumes, right? But the first half had fewer. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell; it should just replicate. So in the first half, which has a high dilution (1e7), the phage isn't replicating well, so fewer plumes are detected. In the second half, with a lower dilution (1e5), the phage replication is better, so more plumes are detected. The fact that the lysogenic phage (which usually shouldn't lyse) is showing up in both plumes suggests that perhaps both mutations interfere with each other, leading to no lytic activity despite the lysogenic phage being present. \n\nNow, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the combination of two mutations occurring in the same gene, resulting in a new protein. The level of recombination determines whether the two mutations functionally oppose each other or work together. If they recombine, the product may have a net negative effect (like increased resistance or decreased susceptibility). In this context, the presence of both mutations probably leads to a double mutant phenotype, which could be either synergistic or antagonistic. \n\nIn the experiment, the fact that only half of the cells showed the lysogenic phage's effect suggests that the lysogenic phage wasn't active enough in the first half. But wait, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse anyway\u2014it should replicate and cause plasmid replication. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, the experiment might involve multiple generations, but that's complicating things. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes relates to the frequency of the mutants. The ratio of plumes can indicate the degree of recombination. For example, if both mutations are present independently, they might produce a certain number of recombinants. But in this case, the total plumes are 4 + 40 = 44. Since the first half (with 4 plumes) lacks the lysogenic phage's effect, and the second half (40 plumes) does, the lysogenic phage's presence is confirmed in the second half. \n\nBut wait, if the lysogenic phage isn't acting correctly in the first half, then perhaps the recombination occurs such that the lysogenic phage can't activate the lysogenic machinery, even though it's present. This would suggest that the two mutations are working against each other, leading to a non-functional lysogenic phage. \n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\nPercentage of recombination = (Number of recombinant plumes / Total plumes) * 100\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies directly here. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can give an idea of the likelihood of recombination. If both mutations are independent and contribute to the same phenotype, the expected number of plumes would depend on their individual frequencies. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations causes the cell to lyse, which contradicts expectations unless they interfere. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plumes in the presence of one mutation versus another reflects their relative strengths. The lysogenic phage (without mutation) would cause more plumes than the lysogenic phage with mutation, but in this case, the lysogenic phage without mutation would not lyse. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nLet me think differently. The presence of both mutations reduces the number of plumes in the first half compared to the second half. The difference in plumes (40 - 4 = 36) could relate to the degree of recombination. Each mutation contributes to the overall effect, and their interaction affects the outcome. If the two mutations are completely recombined, the effect would be opposite to both. If they are partially recombined, their effect would be additive or subtractive. \n\nGiven that the first half has fewer plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is still active, causing plumes. The second half, however, has more plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage with mutation is now active. Therefore, the lysogenic phage without mutation is inactive in the first half, while the lysogenic phage with mutation is active in the second half. This suggests that the two mutations interfere, possibly causing the lysogenic phage to become inactive. \n\nTo quantify the recombination, we can calculate the ratio of the plumes in each condition. The total plumes are 44. The first half (4 plumes) corresponds to the lysogenic phage without mutation, and the second half (40 plumes) corresponds to the lysogenic phage with mutation. The ratio of plumes in the absence vs presence of mutation is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, and 40/44 \u2248 90.9%. These ratios suggest that the lysogenic phage with mutation is significantly more effective, implying a strong interaction or complete recombination. \n\nIf the two mutations fully recombine, the lysogenic phage would be inactive, leading to a decrease in plumes. Here, the presence of the lysogenic phage without mutation alone (in the first half) accounts for 9% of the plumes, leaving 91% attributed to the lysogenic phage with mutation. This suggests that the two mutations are completely recombined, meaning their effects oppose each other. \n\nHowever, none of the options provided go up to 100%. The closest option is H (5%) and G (0.5%). But my calculation suggests almost complete recombination, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B (2%) because the increase from 4 to 40 plumes might imply a smaller fraction. Wait, 40 is ten times more than 4, which would correspond to a 25% increase. But the options don't include 25%. Alternatively, considering the initial plumes, the difference in plumes is 36, which over 44 gives approximately 81.8%. That doesn't match any options either. \n\nMaybe I need to reconsider. The problem states that the resultantly saturated and then divided. Then one half is diluted 1:1e7 and plated on strain B, yielding 4 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on strain K, giving 40 plumes. The ratio of plumes is 4:40=1:10. Since the lysogenic phage without mutation would typically cause more plumes than the one with mutation, this suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is functioning (as it would in the first half), while the lysogenic phage with mutation is now causing more plumes. \n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage without mutation is active in the first half, and the lysogenic phage with mutation is active in the second half. The difference in plumes (40-4=36) could represent the additional plumes due to the mutation. If the lysogenic phage without mutation is contributing 4 plumes, and the mutation is adding 36, that might indicate a significant increase. \n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probabilities, the probability that a phage carries the lysogenic mutation is p. The expected number of plumes would be proportional to p*(1-p) for a double mutant, but this is getting too complex. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to note that the ratio of plumes is 4:40=1:10. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with mutation is 10 times more effective than the one without mutation. If the two mutations are completely recombined, the effectiveness would be zero. If they are partially recombined, say 50%, the effectiveness would be moderate. But in our case, the effectiveness is 10x, which is quite high. \n\nLooking back at the options, none reach 100%. The highest is F (0.3%) and D (0.02%). None of these are close to 10x. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. It says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" Recombination frequency is typically expressed as the percentage of times two mutations interact, but in this case, it's about the effect. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the percentage of cells where both mutations occurred. If recombination is complete, the two mutations would coexist in all cells, but in this case, only the lysogenic phage without mutation is active in the first half. So perhaps the recombination is partial. \n\nWait, another angle: the presence of both mutations leads to a net inhibition of lysogenic fission, which is the opposite of expectation. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both occurring is p1*p2. But in reality, they're interacting, so the probability is p1 + p2 - p1*p2. Depending on the values, this could lead to either positive or negative effects. \n\nAssuming that each mutation individually increases the likelihood of lysogenic fission, the combined effect could be either synergistic (both working) or antagonistic (opposite effects). In this case, the first half (high dilution) has fewer plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without mutation is active, while the second half (lower dilution) has more plumes, indicating the lysogenic phage with mutation is active. \n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is functioning normally, while the one with mutation is now causing more plumes. If the two mutations worked together, the lysogenic phage without mutation wouldn't cause as many plumes, but instead, the lysogenic phage with mutation would. Hence, the observed effect is due to the mutation interfering with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. \n\nThe exact recombination rate depends on how the two mutations affect the replication process. If they are complementary, the lysogenic phage would fail to replicate, reducing plumes. If they are anti-complementary, they enhance each other, increasing plumes. \n\nSince the presence of both mutations leads to reduced plumes, this suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is causing issues, hence the recombination is such that the lysogenic phage becomes ineffective. \n\nCalculating the recombination percentage: If the two mutations are independent and each contributes to the lysogeny, the expected number of recombinants would be p1*p2. But in this case, the plume numbers suggest that the effect is opposite. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the probability of recombination (R):\n\nR = (p1 + p2 - R)/2\n\nBut without knowing the actual frequencies, it's tricky. Given the options, I'm leaning towards the conclusion that the recombination is complete, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B (2%) because the increase from 4 to 40 plumes suggests a 25% increase, but that's speculative. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the ratio of plumes is 1:10, which might correspond to a 2% recombination. \n\nAfter considering various angles, I'll settle on option B (2%), as it aligns with the observed increase in plumes, suggesting some degree of interaction between the mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The key point here is recombination\u2014when two mutations occur in the same gene, they can either work together or oppose each other. In this case, the phage might cause the DNA to be packaged differently depending on which mutation is present. \n\nThe experiment shows that when both types are present, only half of the bacteria show the effect (lyses), while the other half don't. That suggests that the presence of both mutations leads to some sort of interference where their effects cancel each other out. This interference is often referred to as the 'recombination' phenomenon. Recombination would mean that the mutations work against each other, leading to less than expected lysis. The number of plumes indicates how much of each type was effective. \n\nSo, the data given: one half with 4 plumes (probably 4 events of lytic infection) and the other half with 40 plumes. Since the first half has fewer plumes, it must contain the lysogenic phage because its effect was seen in both halves but at different concentrations. The second half, having more plumes, likely contains the phage that doesn't lyse the cell. Now, why did the first half have fewer plumes? Because the lysogenic phage is active, causing lytic fission, which should kill the bacteria. However, in this case, only a small number (4) were observed, meaning the lysogenic phage didn't cause enough damage. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage caused enough damage in the second half (40 plumes), indicating that the lysogenic phage is functional. \n\nWait, no, that seems conflicting. If the lysogenic phage is functional, it should cause more plumes, right? But the first half had fewer. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell; it should just replicate. So in the first half, which has a high dilution (1e7), the phage isn't replicating well, so fewer plumes are detected. In the second half, with a lower dilution (1e5), the phage replication is better, so more plumes are detected. The fact that the lysogenic phage (which usually shouldn't lyse) is showing up in both plumes suggests that perhaps both mutations interfere with each other, leading to no lytic activity despite the lysogenic phage being present. \n\nNow, the question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the combination of two mutations occurring in the same gene, resulting in a new protein. The level of recombination determines whether the two mutations functionally oppose each other or work together. If they recombine, the product may have a net negative effect (like increased resistance or decreased susceptibility). In this context, the presence of both mutations probably leads to a double mutant phenotype, which could be either synergistic or antagonistic. \n\nIn the experiment, the fact that only half of the cells showed the lysogenic phage's effect suggests that the lysogenic phage wasn't active enough in the first half. But wait, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse anyway\u2014it should replicate and cause plasmid replication. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, the experiment might involve multiple generations, but that's complicating things. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes relates to the frequency of the mutants. The ratio of plumes can indicate the degree of recombination. For example, if both mutations are present independently, they might produce a certain number of recombinants. But in this case, the total plumes are 4 + 40 = 44. Since the first half (with 4 plumes) lacks the lysogenic phage's effect, and the second half (40 plumes) does, the lysogenic phage's presence is confirmed in the second half. \n\nBut wait, if the lysogenic phage isn't acting correctly in the first half, then perhaps the recombination occurs such that the lysogenic phage can't activate the lysogenic machinery, even though it's present. This would suggest that the two mutations are working against each other, leading to a non-functional lysogenic phage. \n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage of recombination is:\n\nPercentage of recombination = (Number of recombinant plumes / Total plumes) * 100\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies directly here. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can give an idea of the likelihood of recombination. If both mutations are independent and contribute to the same phenotype, the expected number of plumes would depend on their individual frequencies. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations causes the cell to lyse, which contradicts expectations unless they interfere. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plumes in the presence of one mutation versus another reflects their relative strengths. The lysogenic phage (without mutation) would cause more plumes than the lysogenic phage with mutation, but in this case, the lysogenic phage without mutation would not lyse. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nLet me think differently. The presence of both mutations reduces the number of plumes in the first half compared to the second half. The difference in plumes (40 - 4 = 36) could relate to the degree of recombination. Each mutation contributes to the overall effect, and their interaction affects the outcome. If the two mutations are completely recombined, the effect would be opposite to both. If they are partially recombined, their effect would be additive or subtractive. \n\nGiven that the first half has fewer plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is still active, causing plumes. The second half, however, has more plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage with mutation is now active. Therefore, the lysogenic phage without mutation is inactive in the first half, while the lysogenic phage with mutation is active in the second half. This suggests that the two mutations interfere, possibly causing the lysogenic phage to become inactive. \n\nTo quantify the recombination, we can calculate the ratio of the plumes in each condition. The total plumes are 44. The first half (4 plumes) corresponds to the lysogenic phage without mutation, and the second half (40 plumes) corresponds to the lysogenic phage with mutation. The ratio of plumes in the absence vs presence of mutation is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, and 40/44 \u2248 90.9%. These ratios suggest that the lysogenic phage with mutation is significantly more effective, implying a strong interaction or complete recombination. \n\nIf the two mutations fully recombine, the lysogenic phage would be inactive, leading to a decrease in plumes. Here, the presence of the lysogenic phage without mutation alone (in the first half) accounts for 9% of the plumes, leaving 91% attributed to the lysogenic phage with mutation. This suggests that the two mutations are completely recombined, meaning their effects oppose each other. \n\nHowever, none of the options provided go up to 100%. The closest option is H (5%) and G (0.5%). But my calculation suggests almost complete recombination, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B (2%) because the increase from 4 to 40 plumes might imply a smaller fraction. Wait, 40 is ten times more than 4, which would correspond to a 25% increase. But the options don't include 25%. Alternatively, considering the initial plumes, the difference in plumes is 36, which over 44 gives approximately 81.8%. That doesn't match any options either. \n\nMaybe I need to reconsider. The problem states that the resultantly saturated and then divided. Then one half is diluted 1:1e7 and plated on strain B, yielding 4 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on strain K, giving 40 plumes. The ratio of plumes is 4:40=1:10. Since the lysogenic phage without mutation would typically cause more plumes than the one with mutation, this suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is functioning (as it would in the first half), while the lysogenic phage with mutation is now causing more plumes. \n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage without mutation is active in the first half, and the lysogenic phage with mutation is active in the second half. The difference in plumes (40-4=36) could represent the additional plumes due to the mutation. If the lysogenic phage without mutation is contributing 4 plumes, and the mutation is adding 36, that might indicate a significant increase. \n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probabilities, the probability that a phage carries the lysogenic mutation is p. The expected number of plumes would be proportional to p*(1-p) for a double mutant, but this is getting too complex. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to note that the ratio of plumes is 4:40=1:10. This suggests that the lysogenic phage with mutation is 10 times more effective than the one without mutation. If the two mutations are completely recombined, the effectiveness would be zero. If they are partially recombined, say 50%, the effectiveness would be moderate. But in our case, the effectiveness is 10x, which is quite high. \n\nLooking back at the options, none reach 100%. The highest is F (0.3%) and D (0.02%). None of these are close to 10x. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. It says \"the amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" Recombination frequency is typically expressed as the percentage of times two mutations interact, but in this case, it's about the effect. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the percentage of cells where both mutations occurred. If recombination is complete, the two mutations would coexist in all cells, but in this case, only the lysogenic phage without mutation is active in the first half. So perhaps the recombination is partial. \n\nWait, another angle: the presence of both mutations leads to a net inhibition of lysogenic fission, which is the opposite of expectation. If the mutations are independent, the probability of both occurring is p1*p2. But in reality, they're interacting, so the probability is p1 + p2 - p1*p2. Depending on the values, this could lead to either positive or negative effects. \n\nAssuming that each mutation individually increases the likelihood of lysogenic fission, the combined effect could be either synergistic (both working) or antagonistic (opposite effects). In this case, the first half (high dilution) has fewer plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage without mutation is active, while the second half (lower dilution) has more plumes, indicating the lysogenic phage with mutation is active. \n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is functioning normally, while the one with mutation is now causing more plumes. If the two mutations worked together, the lysogenic phage without mutation wouldn't cause as many plumes, but instead, the lysogenic phage with mutation would. Hence, the observed effect is due to the mutation interfering with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. \n\nThe exact recombination rate depends on how the two mutations affect the replication process. If they are complementary, the lysogenic phage would fail to replicate, reducing plumes. If they are anti-complementary, they enhance each other, increasing plumes. \n\nSince the presence of both mutations leads to reduced plumes, this suggests that the lysogenic phage without mutation is causing issues, hence the recombination is such that the lysogenic phage becomes ineffective. \n\nCalculating the recombination percentage: If the two mutations are independent and each contributes to the lysogeny, the expected number of recombinants would be p1*p2. But in this case, the plume numbers suggest that the effect is opposite. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the probability of recombination (R):\n\nR = (p1 + p2 - R)/2\n\nBut without knowing the actual frequencies, it's tricky. Given the options, I'm leaning towards the conclusion that the recombination is complete, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B (2%) because the increase from 4 to 40 plumes suggests a 25% increase, but that's speculative. Alternatively, considering the dilution factors, the ratio of plumes is 1:10, which might correspond to a 2% recombination. \n\nAfter considering various angles, I'll settle on option B (2%), as it aligns with the observed increase in plumes, suggesting some degree of interaction between the mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Since the question asks for the amount of recombination, I should recall that in recombinant DNA technology, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous regions.

If the recombination rate is low, the mutations might be independent; if high, they're likely interacting. \n\nLooking at the results, when both phages are present, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. That implies that the lysogenic phage isn't being replicated or causing issues when mixed with others, possibly due to its independence. However, when the lysogenic phage is mixed with the other type, it starts causing problems in strain B, meaning there's some interaction happening. This interaction is probably due to recombination. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p * q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations.

That seems contradictory because a higher dilution should lead to more clonal phages, right? Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the presence of multiple phage types, sometimes they form a mixture where some are dominant and others are recessive. Or perhaps in the presence of certain conditions, the phages might intercalate their genes into the host DNA. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe key here is determining the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the genes from different phage types are placed together on the same chromosome. In the context of E. coli, this would involve the T_4 phage's genome. Each mutation introduces a specific change. If the mutations are recombined, the resulting phage protein might be different than if they remained separate.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the effect depends on how they interact. If they're independent (no recombination), the probability of a particular mutation occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in this case, the outcome is that only strain B shows lysis, which implies that the lysogenic phage is more effective when combined with another type. Alternatively, maybe the presence of one mutation suppresses the other, leading to less lysis.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that both types are present, and the result is that strain B is affected, while strain K isn't. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysis) is not effective when mixed with the non-lytic phage. So maybe the presence of the non-lytic phage inhibits the lysogenic phage, causing fewer plasmids to replicate, thus reducing the lytic effect. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are competing for replication sites, but that's more about plating efficiency rather than recombination.\n\nBut focusing back on the results, the main point is about the recombination. Since only strain B is affected when both mutants are present, it suggests that the two mutations are recombined in such a way that the lysogenic phage cannot effectively infect E. coli strain B. This could happen through a process like chromosomal transposition or insertion of one mutation into the gene responsible for the lysogenic state of the phage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring)\n\nBut in this case, the total number of plasmids (or bacteria) is split into two groups: one with 1e7 dilution and 4 plumes, and another with 1e5 dilution and 40 plumes. Wait, but plumes represent successful infections. If you plate on strain B, you expect all plumes to come from the phages on strain B. Similarly, if you plate on strain K, all plumes come from the phages on K. However, if the phages are recombining, then in the presence of both strains, maybe some plasmids are coming from either strain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of one type of phage affects the replication or expression of the other. For example, the non-lytic phage might degrade the lysogenic phage, preventing it from replicating properly. Thus, when both are present, the lysogenic phage cannot function as expected, leading to reduced or no lysis on strain B.\n\nAssuming that the recombination leads to the failure of the lysogenic phage to infect strain B, the number of plumes observed on strain B would decrease compared to when only the lysogenic phage is present. However, in the given data, when both are present, strain B still shows lysis, but that's conflicting with the initial scenario where only lysogenic phages cause lysis. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again carefully. It says that T_4 phages carrying mutations in the genomic region rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not strain K. So when only the lysogenic phage is present, strain B is affected. When both types are present, only strain B is affected. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if both are present, why wouldn't strain K be affected? Unless the presence of the lysogenic phage somehow inhibits the replication of the non-lytic phage, making strain B more susceptible. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage can integrate into the gene region causing double-strand breaks, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both types of phages causes interference. For example, the non-lytic phage might cause a secondary mutation in the lysogenic phage, making it non-effective. But I'm not entirely clear on that mechanism.\n\nBack to the experiment. When both types are present, the result is that only strain B is affected. So the lysogenic phage can't infect strain K despite being present. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's ability to infect strain K is impaired due to the presence of the non-lytic phage, possibly because of some genetic interaction. This might indicate that the mutations are linked on the same chromosome, meaning the T_4 phage has undergone recombination.\n\nNow, to determine the recombination frequency, which would tell us how much of the T_4 genome is shared between the two mutations. The recombination frequency is typically calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant alleles / Total number of alleles)\n\nBut in this context, since we're dealing with mutations in the same region, the formula might apply differently. Alternatively, the probability of recombination can be estimated by looking at the ratio of plasmid concentrations and the number of plasmids observed.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, the main observation is that when both mutations are present, strain B is affected, whereas when only the lysogenic is present, strain B is also affected. But when the other type (non-lytic) is present, strain K is not affected. This suggests that the non-lytic phage somehow prevents the lysogenic phage from infecting strain B, implying that the two mutations are interacting, likely through recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are recombined, the lysogenic phage may lose its ability to infect strain B, hence strain B remains unaffected. Conversely, if they remain separate, the lysogenic phage should infect strain B regardless of the presence of the non-lytic phage.\n\nSo, the presence of both types of phages in the mix is causing a reduction in the lysogenic phage's ability to infect strain B, indicating that the two mutations are recombined. Now, to find the percentage of recombination, we can look at the ratio of plasmids on strain B and K.\n\nWhen both types are present, the number of plasmids on strain B is 4, and on strain K is 40. But wait, when both types are present, the total plasmid concentration is higher because both types are present in equal amounts. However, the presence of the non-lytic phage might affect the replication efficiency of the lysogenic phage, leading to fewer plasmids being replicated or expressed.\n\nBut in terms of calculation, the recombination frequency can be determined by comparing the number of plasmids on each strain. If the recombination occurred, the distribution of plasmids between the strains would reflect the degree of recombination.\n\nGiven that when both types are present, strain B has fewer plasmids (4 vs. 40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage is less able to infect strain B, which could be due to recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of plasmids on each strain. However, without knowing the exact method of mixing, it's challenging to directly compute the recombination frequency. Instead, we can infer based on the numbers provided.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage is less effective when both types are present, the recombination must have occurred, leading to a lower probability of the lysogenic phage infecting strain B. To quantify the recombination, we can assume that the presence of the non-lytic phage reduces the efficiency of the lysogenic phage, suggesting that the two mutations are linked.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible answers are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 5%. Given that the recombination isn't complete (since strain B is affected), the recombination frequency is likely low. Among the options, 0.02% is very low, which fits our expectation. However, another approach is to consider the dilution ratios. The first half is 1e7 dilution, and the second is 1e5. Perhaps the recombination occurs at a certain ratio of these dilutions, but without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids, the ratio of plasmids on strain B to K is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. If the recombination happened, this ratio reflects the proportion of plasmids that came from the original strain versus the new plasmids introduced due to recombination. However, calculating the exact percentage from this is complex without additional data.\n\nAnother angle is to recognize that when recombination occurs, the two mutations are joined on the chromosome, reducing the potential for independent assortment. However, in this case, the presence of recombination lowers the efficacy of the lysogenic phage against strain B, leading to fewer plasmids on strain B.\n\nGiven the options, 0.02% seems plausible, indicating a very low level of recombination. Therefore, the answer would be J. 0.05 percent, but wait, the options don't go up to 0.05. The closest is H. 5%, but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination is minimal, around 0.02%.\n\nWait, but another thought: if the lysogenic phage is less effective when recombined, the number of plasmids on strain B would decrease. The initial number of plasmids on each strain is proportional to their dilution. If strain B has a higher dilution (1e7), it has fewer plasmids, but the presence of the non-lytic phage might further reduce the number. However, without knowing the exact mechanism, it's difficult to precisely calculate the recombination frequency.\n\nConsidering all this, the most reasonable choice among the options is 0.02%, which corresponds to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Then, in the first half (diluted 1e7), the number of plumes was 4, while in the second half (diluted 1e5), it was 40. That seems contradictory because a higher dilution should lead to more clonal phages, right? Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the presence of multiple phage types, sometimes they form a mixture where some are dominant and others are recessive. Or perhaps in the presence of certain conditions, the phages might intercalate their genes into the host DNA. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe key here is determining the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the genes from different phage types are placed together on the same chromosome. In the context of E. coli, this would involve the T_4 phage's genome. Each mutation introduces a specific change. If the mutations are recombined, the resulting phage protein might be different than if they remained separate.\n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the effect depends on how they interact. If they're independent (no recombination), the probability of a particular mutation occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in this case, the outcome is that only strain B shows lysis, which implies that the lysogenic phage is more effective when combined with another type. Alternatively, maybe the presence of one mutation suppresses the other, leading to less lysis.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that both types are present, and the result is that strain B is affected, while strain K isn't. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysis) is not effective when mixed with the non-lytic phage. So maybe the presence of the non-lytic phage inhibits the lysogenic phage, causing fewer plasmids to replicate, thus reducing the lytic effect. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are competing for replication sites, but that's more about plating efficiency rather than recombination.\n\nBut focusing back on the results, the main point is about the recombination. Since only strain B is affected when both mutants are present, it suggests that the two mutations are recombined in such a way that the lysogenic phage cannot effectively infect E. coli strain B. This could happen through a process like chromosomal transposition or insertion of one mutation into the gene responsible for the lysogenic state of the phage.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring)\n\nBut in this case, the total number of plasmids (or bacteria) is split into two groups: one with 1e7 dilution and 4 plumes, and another with 1e5 dilution and 40 plumes. Wait, but plumes represent successful infections. If you plate on strain B, you expect all plumes to come from the phages on strain B. Similarly, if you plate on strain K, all plumes come from the phages on K. However, if the phages are recombining, then in the presence of both strains, maybe some plasmids are coming from either strain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of one type of phage affects the replication or expression of the other. For example, the non-lytic phage might degrade the lysogenic phage, preventing it from replicating properly. Thus, when both are present, the lysogenic phage cannot function as expected, leading to reduced or no lysis on strain B.\n\nAssuming that the recombination leads to the failure of the lysogenic phage to infect strain B, the number of plumes observed on strain B would decrease compared to when only the lysogenic phage is present. However, in the given data, when both are present, strain B still shows lysis, but that's conflicting with the initial scenario where only lysogenic phages cause lysis. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again carefully. It says that T_4 phages carrying mutations in the genomic region rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not strain K. So when only the lysogenic phage is present, strain B is affected. When both types are present, only strain B is affected. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if both are present, why wouldn't strain K be affected? Unless the presence of the lysogenic phage somehow inhibits the replication of the non-lytic phage, making strain B more susceptible. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage can integrate into the gene region causing double-strand breaks, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both types of phages causes interference. For example, the non-lytic phage might cause a secondary mutation in the lysogenic phage, making it non-effective. But I'm not entirely clear on that mechanism.\n\nBack to the experiment. When both types are present, the result is that only strain B is affected. So the lysogenic phage can't infect strain K despite being present. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's ability to infect strain K is impaired due to the presence of the non-lytic phage, possibly because of some genetic interaction. This might indicate that the mutations are linked on the same chromosome, meaning the T_4 phage has undergone recombination.\n\nNow, to determine the recombination frequency, which would tell us how much of the T_4 genome is shared between the two mutations. The recombination frequency is typically calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of recombinant alleles / Total number of alleles)\n\nBut in this context, since we're dealing with mutations in the same region, the formula might apply differently. Alternatively, the probability of recombination can be estimated by looking at the ratio of plasmid concentrations and the number of plasmids observed.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, the main observation is that when both mutations are present, strain B is affected, whereas when only the lysogenic is present, strain B is also affected. But when the other type (non-lytic) is present, strain K is not affected. This suggests that the non-lytic phage somehow prevents the lysogenic phage from infecting strain B, implying that the two mutations are interacting, likely through recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are recombined, the lysogenic phage may lose its ability to infect strain B, hence strain B remains unaffected.

That would mean that when they plated on strain K, only four of the phages were successful in infecting K's cells. On strain B, 40 plumes, meaning 40 phages successfully infected B's cells. Since both mutations are present, perhaps some of the phages carry both mutations, leading to full-blown lysogeny. In a normal case without recombination, you'd expect approximately 10% of the phages to carry the mutation (since 1/10 of a population has the mutation), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of multiple mutations could lead to different outcomes depending on whether they're integrated or not. Maybe the lysogenic phage is being integrated with the lysogenic mutation from the other type, leading to more severe effects.

So if both mutation types are present, maybe the lysogenic phage cannot integrate the lysogenic mutation, thus not causing lysis. Instead, perhaps the phages are either lysogenic or phage-like, but their interactions determine the outcome. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The key here is determining the number of recombinants. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules. If the lysogenic phage carries both mutations, then they can recombine. The number of such recombinant phages would depend on how often they exchange these mutations. The experiment shows that on strain B, 40 plumes were observed, while on strain K, only 4 were found. This suggests that the lysogenic phage had a higher chance of infecting strain B than K. But why? Unless the recombination happened more frequently in strain B. Wait, but strain B is the one showing issues. If the lysogenic phage carries both mutations, and recombines, maybe that affects its ability to infect strain B. However, the problem states that only E. coli strain B shows issues, which implies that the lysogenic phage couldn't do anything. So perhaps the recombination didn't happen in strain B. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage can integrate the lysogenic mutation, making it fully lysogenic. But that wouldn't explain why only strain B is affected. Maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't integrate the lysogenic mutation, thus remaining lysogenic and causing lysis. But the problem says that the lysogenic phage is responsible for lysis, so if both types are present, maybe the phage that carries both mutations integrates and becomes fully lysogenic, thereby not causing lysis. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate the lysogenic mutation, leading to a more severe phenotype. Wait, but the problem says that both types are present, and only E. coli strain B shows issues. So if the lysogenic phage can integrate the lysogenic mutation, then any phage carrying that mutation would become fully lysogenic and not cause lysis. Therefore, the lysogenic phage type that carries the lysogenic mutation would not cause lysis, while the phage type that only carries the lysogenic mutation would. If both types are present, maybe the phages that carry both mutations integrate and become fully lysogenic, while those that carry only one mutation remain lysogenic and cause lysis. But the problem states that only E. coli strain B shows issues, implying that the lysogenic phage did something. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about the numbers given. On strain B, 40 plumes were observed, and on strain K, 4 plumes were found. That's a ratio of 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that the lysogenic phage was more likely to infect strain B than strain K. Now, if the recombination occurred in strain B, then the lysogenic phage that carried both mutations would have a higher chance of infecting strain B. Alternatively, the presence of recombination might affect the probability of infection. Let me recall the formula for calculating recombination frequency. The expected number of recombinants is calculated using the formula (p)(q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. However, in this context, the phages are carrying mutations, and we're looking at recombination between the two types. The observed plasmid density after dilution tells us about the likelihood of recombination. The dilution factor for strain B was 1:1e7, meaning 0.0000001 of the phage population was plated. For strain K, it was 1:1e5, meaning 0.00001 of the phage population was plated. The number of plumes indicates the likelihood of recombination. Each plume represents an infection. The higher the number of plumes on strain B compared to strain K, the more likely recombination occurred in strain B. The formula for the likelihood of recombination is given by the ratio of plumes on the two samples. The ratio here is 40:4 = 10:1. To find the recombination frequency, we use the formula R = ln(N / (N - r)), where N is the total number of plumes, and r is the number of recombined plumes. Alternatively, another way to calculate it is using the ratio of plumes. The formula is R = (number of recombined plumes) / (total plumes). Here, total plumes on strain B are 40 + 4 = 44. Number of recombined plumes is 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming all plumes on strain B are either recombined or not). Wait, no, that's incorrect. The number of recombined plumes would be equal to the difference between the number of plumes on the two samples. Because if you have X plumes on sample A and Y on sample B, the maximum possible recombined plumes are min(X,Y), assuming that every phage from sample A combines with every phage from sample B except those that don't recombine. So in this case, X=40, Y=4, so min(40,4)=4 recombined plumes. Thus, the recombination rate is 4/(4+4)=50%. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, the recombination frequency is calculated as (X - Y)/(X + Y). So (40-4)/44 = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. But the options provided don't include 81%, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can also be calculated using the formula: R = (R_B - R_K) / (1 + e^{-(R_B - R_K)}}), but I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the ratio of plumes (10:1) corresponds to a certain degree of recombination. Typically, a ratio of 1:1 would imply complete recombination, resulting in R=100%. A ratio of 10:1 would correspond to R\u224890%. Looking at the answer choices, option F is 0.3%, which is much lower than 90%. Option G is 0.5%, still lower. Option C is 1.5%, D is 0.1%, H is 5%. Option I is 0.02%, J is 0.05%. None of these match 90%, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I should consider that the recombination occurs in both regions, but the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of infection. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the relative efficiency of the phages in each area. Strain B showed 10 times more plumes than strain K, indicating that the phages in strain B were more effective. If the recombination increased the efficiency, then the increase in plumes could indicate partial recombination. But without knowing the exact method of calculation, it's hard to pinpoint. Given the options, perhaps the closest is 0.05% (option J), which is around 0.05%. Alternatively, considering that the ratio is 10:1, and each additional unit of recombination reduces the efficiency, but without a specific formula, it's difficult. Perhaps the correct answer is 0.05%, corresponding to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Now, if the recombination occurred in strain B, then the lysogenic phage that carried both mutations would have a higher chance of infecting strain B. Alternatively, the presence of recombination might affect the probability of infection. Let me recall the formula for calculating recombination frequency. The expected number of recombinants is calculated using the formula (p)(q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. However, in this context, the phages are carrying mutations, and we're looking at recombination between the two types. The observed plasmid density after dilution tells us about the likelihood of recombination. The dilution factor for strain B was 1:1e7, meaning 0.0000001 of the phage population was plated. For strain K, it was 1:1e5, meaning 0.00001 of the phage population was plated. The number of plumes indicates the likelihood of recombination. Each plume represents an infection. The higher the number of plumes on strain B compared to strain K, the more likely recombination occurred in strain B. The formula for the likelihood of recombination is given by the ratio of plumes on the two samples. The ratio here is 40:4 = 10:1. To find the recombination frequency, we use the formula R = ln(N / (N - r)), where N is the total number of plumes, and r is the number of recombined plumes. Alternatively, another way to calculate it is using the ratio of plumes. The formula is R = (number of recombined plumes) / (total plumes). Here, total plumes on strain B are 40 + 4 = 44. Number of recombined plumes is 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming all plumes on strain B are either recombined or not). Wait, no, that's incorrect. The number of recombined plumes would be equal to the difference between the number of plumes on the two samples. Because if you have X plumes on sample A and Y on sample B, the maximum possible recombined plumes are min(X,Y), assuming that every phage from sample A combines with every phage from sample B except those that don't recombine. So in this case, X=40, Y=4, so min(40,4)=4 recombined plumes. Thus, the recombination rate is 4/(4+4)=50%. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, the recombination frequency is calculated as (X - Y)/(X + Y). So (40-4)/44 = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. But the options provided don't include 81%, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can also be calculated using the formula: R = (R_B - R_K) / (1 + e^{-(R_B - R_K)}}), but I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider that the ratio of plumes (10:1) corresponds to a certain degree of recombination. Typically, a ratio of 1:1 would imply complete recombination, resulting in R=100%. A ratio of 10:1 would correspond to R\u224890%. Looking at the answer choices, option F is 0.3%, which is much lower than 90%. Option G is 0.5%, still lower. Option C is 1.5%, D is 0.1%, H is 5%. Option I is 0.02%, J is 0.05%. None of these match 90%, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I should consider that the recombination occurs in both regions, but the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of infection. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the relative efficiency of the phages in each area. Strain B showed 10 times more plumes than strain K, indicating that the phages in strain B were more effective. If the recombination increased the efficiency, then the increase in plumes could indicate partial recombination. But without knowing the exact method of calculation, it's hard to pinpoint. Given the options, perhaps the closest is 0.05% (option J), which is around 0.05%. Alternatively, considering that the ratio is 10:1, and each additional unit of recombination reduces the efficiency, but without a specific formula, it's difficult. Perhaps the correct answer is 0.05%, corresponding to option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",

    "rollout": " The initial plate shows that strain B has issues from the lysogenic phage, but when both are present, the effect is similar to just the lysogenic phage. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation isn't causing the problem on its own, meaning the recombination must be happening. \n\nThe key here is understanding how recombination affects the fitness of the phages. Recombination would allow the two mutations to work together, perhaps combining their effects. Since the lysogenic phage alone doesn't cause lysis, but when combined with the wild-type mutation (which might lyse), they could potentially interfere. However, in the experiment, the presence of both mutants leads to the same outcome as the lysogenic alone, suggesting that the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to still lyse the bacteria despite being mutated. Wait, no, because the lysogenic phage without any mutation should lyse. Hmm, perhaps the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to still lyse even with the mutation, meaning the mutation doesn't affect its ability to lyse. Alternatively, the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to survive better because the wild-type mutation works against it, preventing the lysogenic from replicating. \n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes observed on each lawn depends on the dilution factor. If the recombination increases, then the phages can infect more cells, leading to more plumes. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage (with mutation) didn't cause much issue on strain B, but when mixed with the wild-type, it did. Maybe the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to still lyse the bacteria because the wild-type mutation prevents it from replicating effectively. So the recombination point where the lysogenic phage can still replicate despite the mutation.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - e^{-2p}\n\nwhere p is the proportion of recombinant alleles. But in this context, it's more about how many times the mutations interact. Alternatively, the probability of recombination is given by:\n\nProbability = 1 - (1/(n+1))\n\nwhere n is the number of chromosome segments. But wait, in this case, it's a single locus, so maybe it's different. Perhaps using the ratio of plumes on the two lattices. On the first plate, the lysogenic phage caused 40 plumes, and on the second, the wild-type caused 4 plumes. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage was more likely to cause infections than the wild-type when both were present. If the recombination increased the likelihood of the lysogenic phage surviving and infecting more cells, then the ratio reflects that. \n\nSo, the formula for the number of recombinants (R) is R = n + 1, where n is the number of non-recombinant events. Here, the number of recombinant events (lysogenic phage) is 40, and the non-recombinant (wild-type) is 4. So R = 40 + 4 = 44. Then, the recombination frequency is R / (R + n) * 100%. Wait, that seems off. Maybe another approach: the expected number of recombinants (R) would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. But in this case, since it's a single locus, perhaps it's more straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations resulted in the same level of infection as the lysogenic alone, the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to still lyse the bacteria. Therefore, the mutation doesn't interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. Thus, the recombination must increase the likelihood of the lysogenic phage surviving enough to infect more cells, hence the higher number of plumes on the lysogenic side. \n\nGiven that, we can model it as the ratio of plumes indicating the strength of the interaction. The higher number of plumes on the lysogenic side suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to replicate despite the mutation. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high. To find the exact percentage, we can use the equation:\n\nNumber of recombinants (R) = (p * q * (n+1)) / (1 - p)\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage had a 100% chance of replication, it would cause all the plumes. With some recombination, it's less effective. The observed ratio is 40 vs 4, which is 10:1. Assuming that the recombination increases the replication rate by a certain factor, say x, then the number of plumes would scale with x. So 1/x = 4/40, which gives x=10. That suggests that the replication is 10 times less efficient, implying that the recombination reduces the efficiency by 9 times. \n\nIf replication is reduced by 9 times, the recombination frequency can be calculated as log(1/e^(-2p)) or something else. Alternatively, using the approximation that the loss in efficiency (1 - e) relates to the recombination frequency. For small p, 1 - e \u2248 2p. Here, e = 1/10, so 1 - e = 0.9, which is close to 1, so 2p \u2248 0.9 \u2192 p \u2248 0.45. But wait, that's too low compared to the options provided, which include up to 5%.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the number of recombinants. The number of recombinants (R) is equal to the sum of the products of the frequencies of each mutation. If the two mutations are at positions A and B, and their frequencies are p and q respectively, then R = 2pq/(p + q). Wait, no, that's for linked genes. In this case, since it's a single locus, perhaps it's simpler. \n\nAnother approach is to realize that the presence of both mutations increases the chance of recombination. The ratio of plumes indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect the cells, meaning that the recombination increases its replication efficiency. So, the recombination frequency is such that the lysogenic phage has a higher chance of replicating despite the mutation. \n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a replication efficiency of 100%, causing all the plumes. With recombination, it's lower. The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1. So the replication efficiency is 1/10. Using the formula for recombination frequency, which is R = 1 - e^{-2p}, where p is the recombination frequency. Solving for p when e^{-2p} = 0.9, we get 2p \u2248 -ln(0.9) \u2248 0.105, so p\u22480.0525. That's approximately 0.05, which is 0.05%, but looking back at the options, H is 5% and G is 0.5%. Hmm, perhaps my calculation is off. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula uses the square root of the ratio. Another approach is to use the formula for the probability of recombination: p = sqrt(R/n), where R is the number of recombinant events and n is the total number of possible interactions. But I'm getting confused here. \n\nMaybe a simpler way is to recognize that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, which suggests that the recombination frequency is around 5% (since 5% squared is 0.25, so 1-0.25=0.75, which is 75% survival, but our ratio is 10:1, which is closer to 10, so perhaps the frequency is around 10%, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to look for a pattern in the options. The answer choices go up to 5%, so maybe the correct answer is C, 1.5%, D, 0.1%, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to take the ratio of plumes and solve for the recombination frequency. If the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, then the recombination frequency is the square root of (number of plumes)/(number of plumes + 1), so sqrt(40/41) \u2248 0.975, so about 98%, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the square root of the reciprocal, so sqrt(1/40)=approx 0.158, which is about 16%, again not matching the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the number of plumes indicates the relative efficiency. If the lysogenic phage caused 10x more plumes than the wild-type, that suggests that the recombination increased its replication efficiency. So, the recombination frequency can be approximated by the difference in replication rates. Let's say that the wild-type phage has a replication efficiency of r_w, and the lysogenic phage has r_l. We observe that r_l = 10*r_w. Since the efficiency of replication is related to the recombination frequency, we can model r_l = (1 + f)/ (1 - f), where f is the recombination fraction. But this is getting too complex. Alternatively, using the formula for the number of recombinants R = (p*q*(n+1))/(1-p), assuming p=q due to linkage. But without knowing p, it's difficult. \n\nPerhaps another angle: the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage can still lyse the bacteria when combined with the wild-type mutation. This implies that the recombination allows the lysogenic phage to survive. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be high enough that the lysogenic phage remains viable despite the mutation. Given the options, the closest high value is H (5%). Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is 1%, which is option A. But why? Let me think differently. If the lysogenic phage can still lyse the bacteria when combined with the mutation, it suggests that the mutation doesn't interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. Therefore, the recombination must occur at a frequency that makes the lysogenic phage's replication efficient enough to replicate despite the mutation. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is very low, like 0.1%, the mutation wouldn't significantly affect the lysogenic phage. Conversely, a high recombination frequency would enhance its replication. Given that the lysogenic phage caused more plumes when both types were present, it suggests that recombination increased its replication efficiency, making it more likely to lyse the bacteria. So, a higher recombination frequency would lead to more plumes from the lysogenic phage. Among the options, the highest is H (5%) and G (0.5%). Since the experiment showed a significant increase in plumes, it's likely that the recombination frequency is moderate, possibly around 2%. Looking at the options, B is 2%. Alternatively, if the increase is more than 10 times, which it was (10x), then perhaps the recombination frequency is 5% or so. But I'm not entirely confident. Based on standard models, I think the answer is probably C (1.5%) or B (2%). Given that the ratio of plumes is 10:1, which suggests a significant increase, I'd lean towards 2%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

So, the expected number of recombinant plumes would depend on the product of their individual probabilities. \n\nIn this case, the main difference is the dilution factors. Plating at 1:1e7 vs 1:1e5. Since the latter has a higher dilution factor, the probability of any given phage infecting a cell is lower there. This could mean that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which is less likely to lyse the cell) interacts with the lysogenic phage (which is more likely to lyse), leading to some interference. \n\nWait, no, actually, the lysogenic phage should die upon lysis, while the lysogen doesn't lyse. So combining them shouldn't cause interference unless there's some double-strand break repair mechanism involved. But in most cases, the lysogenic phage is non-lytic, so perhaps the interaction isn't direct. Maybe the experiment is testing whether the presence of both phages affects the outcome differently than either alone. \n\nLooking back, the problem says that the two mutantphages are causing lytic and lysogenic fission respectively. When only lysogenic is present, it's bad. Both together, only the lysogenic is bad. That implies that the lysogenic phage is the one doing the damage, even when multiple types are present. So perhaps their interaction doesn't affect the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate, but maybe it's causing some sort of competition or interference. \n\nBut wait, the experiment shows that when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage is bad. But the actual experiment was: one half was plated on strain B's lawn at 1:1e7, and the other half on strain K's lawn at 1:1e5. Then, four plumes on K and 40 on B. Hmm, wait, that seems inverted. Because if you plate more cells (lower dilution factor), you get more infections. So if you plate 1:1e5, you're plating more cells than 1:1e7. Therefore, the number of plumes detected should be lower if the original sample was worse. But in reality, four plumes on K and 40 on B suggest that K had more plumes, meaning that the K strain's lawn had more cells, so more infections happened. But why? Because if the lysogenic phage is bad, then when both are present, perhaps the lysogenic phage is inhibited by the lysogen from strain B, leading to fewer infections overall. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogen from strain B reduces the efficiency of the lysogenic phage in reproducing. So when you plate at a certain dilution, the number of plumes depends on how much the lysogenic phage can reproduce without being killed. If the lysogen is present, the lysogenic phage can't fully replicate, so the number of plumes decreases. \n\nSo in this experiment, when you plate at a higher dilution factor (1:1e7), you expect fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage is less efficient. At 1:1e5, you'd expect more plumes. But in our case, we saw more plumes on K (40) than on B (4). That suggests that when the phages were placed at a lower dilution factor (1:1e5), more plumes appeared on the K strain. \n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage is bad when alone, but when combined with the lysogen from strain B, it becomes good again. So when you plate at a higher dilution (more cells), you see fewer plumes because the lysogenic phage can't replicate efficiently. But when you plate at a lower dilution (fewer cells), you see more plumes because the lysogenic phage can replicate better. \n\nSo if the experiment was done at 1:1e7, which is a high dilution, and you got 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems odd because at high dilution, you'd expect fewer plumes on both. Unless the lysogenic phage is somehow inhibited by the lysogen from strain B, making it less effective. \n\nWait, maybe the lysogenic phage (from strain B) inhibits the replication of the lysogenic phage, so when you plate at a low dilution (higher density), the lysogenic phage can replicate more effectively, leading to more plumes on the K strain. Conversely, at high dilution, the lysogenic phage is less efficient because it can't replicate as well due to the presence of the lysogen, resulting in fewer plumes on both. \n\nThis suggests that the interaction between the two mutations allows the lysogenic phage (strain B) to inhibit the replication of its own phage (strain K). So the presence of strain B's lysogen reduces the number of successful lytic fission events. Therefore, when you plate at a low dilution (so more cells are plated), you get more successful infections on the K strain, indicating that the lysogen from strain B is inhibiting its own replication. \n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. In such experiments, the number of recombinant plumes is used to estimate the likelihood of recombination between the two mutations. The formula often used is F = 1 - (1/(a + b)), where a and b are the numbers of recombinant plumes observed on each side. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the ratio of the plumes on each side. \n\nAnother method is to use the ratio of the number of plumes on each substrate. For example, the ratio R = N_B / N_K. In this case, R = 4 / 40 = 0.1. This ratio is approximately equal to e^(-2p), where p is the recombination frequency. Solving for p gives us p \u2248 ln(1/0.1)/2 = ln(10)/2 \u2248 1.15 / 2 \u2248 0.575%. But none of the options are close to 0.6%, so maybe I'm using the wrong approach. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of plumes relates inversely to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Let\u2019s denote p as the recombination frequency. If each mutation occurs with probability q, then the total probability of a recombined event is q * (1 - q). The expected number of recombinant plumes would then be proportional to q*(1 - q). \n\nGiven that, we can set up the equation: N_B / N_K = [q*(1 - q)]^{-1}. Here, N_B is the number of plumes on strain B, and N_K is on strain K. So 40 / 4 = 10 = [q*(1 - q)]^{-1}, which means q*(1 - q) = 0.1. Solving this quadratic equation: q\u00b2 - q + 0.1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, q = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 0.4)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(0.6)] / 2 \u2248 [1 \u00b1 0.7746] / 2. Taking the smaller root (since frequencies can't exceed 1): (1 - 0.7746)/2 \u2248 0.1277/2 \u2248 0.0638, which is approximately 6.38%. That's roughly 6% which isn't exactly an option, but looking back at the options, 0.05% is J, and 0.02% is I. These are much lower. Perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes on the two substrates is related to the square of the ratio of the probabilities. Or perhaps the relationship is linear. Let's try another approach. Suppose that the number of plumes on each substrate is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. \n\nIf the probability of mutation A is p and mutation B is q, then the probability of recombination is pq. The number of recombinant plumes would then be proportional to pq. Given that, we can say that the ratio of plumes on the two substrates would be proportional to pq. \n\nSo, assuming that the probability of mutation A is p and mutation B is q, then the ratio N_B / N_K = (p*q) / ((1-p)*(1-q)). But solving this equation requires knowing either p or q. Without additional information, it's difficult to solve directly. However, in the absence of specific data, one common approximation is that the number of recombinant plumes is approximately proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of strain B's lysogen leads to inhibition of the replication of the lysogenic phage, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of plumes. If strain B's lysogen is present, it may reduce the number of successful infections. \n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes on the two substrates is 40/4=10. This suggests that strain B's lysogen was responsible for reducing the number of successful infections by a factor of 10. Assuming that the reduction is due to recombination, the recombination frequency can be approximated by log base 10 of the reduction factor. So log10(10)=1, suggesting a recombination frequency of approximately 1%. Looking at the options, A is 1 percent. That seems plausible. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The key here is the ratio of plumes on the two strains. \n\nThe formula I remember for calculating recombination frequency is F = 1 - (1/(a + b)), where a and b are the number of recombinant events observed.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

The options suggest it's a small fraction, probably less than 1%. How do I calculate that? The formula for recombinant frequency often comes from genetic mapping using test cross experiments. Recombination frequency (RF) is calculated as the proportion of offspring that show a particular trait due to crossing over. In phages, sometimes you look at the distribution of lysogenic and lytic fission events. The presence of plumes indicates successful infections. The number of plumes relates to the efficiency of the phages infecting the cells. If the two mutations are linked, the probability of their combination would be low. But how does that translate into RF? Maybe the number of plumes on each line relates to the likelihood of each mutation being expressed independently. For example, if you have two mutations, R and S, the expected number of plumes on a given host would depend on whether they're independent or recombined. If they're recombined, then the expression might not follow the simple multiplication rule. The formula for RF when considering two genes is RF = [p*(1-q) + q*(1-p)], where p and q are the probabilities of each gene expressing without recombination. Alternatively, if you have a double mutant, the observed plumes could indicate whether they are independent or recombined. In this case, since only strain B was affected when both mutants were present, it suggests that the lysogenic phage caused the problem, while the lytic phage didn't. But why did half of the colonies (plated on B) show issues? Maybe because the lytic phage wasn't effective enough when combined with the lysogenic one. So, when both types are present, the lytic phage isn't sufficient to kill the cells, allowing the lysogenic phage to take over. This implies that the two mutations are likely interacting in a way that allows the lysogenic phage to function better. Now, looking back at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Since the plumes are indicative of successful infections, the high number on B suggests that the lysogenic phage was more effective when both types were present. However, when only one type was present, only some of the cells were infected, leading to fewer plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K (40 vs. 4) gives us a clue about their compatibility. A higher ratio suggests that the lysogenic phage is more compatible with certain bacterial strains, possibly indicating a positive linkage. To find the recombination frequency, we might use the formula RF = (number of plumes expected without recombination - observed plumes) / (expected plumes without recombination). But I'm getting confused here. Another approach is to consider that when two mutations are linked, the number of recombinant offspring is reduced compared to independent assortment. The observed number of recombinants can help estimate the degree of recombination. However, in phage experiments, it's often about the distribution of lysogenic versus lytic fission outcomes. The number of plumes on each line should reflect whether each mutation is expressed independently or together. Since strain B had more plumes when both types were present, it suggests that the lysogenic phage was more efficient. But without knowing the exact mapping, it's tricky. Alternatively, if the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be additive. If they're recombined, the expression might differ. Given the high number of plumes on B, perhaps the lysogenic phage is more active in that context, implying some level of recombination. To find the percentage, I might need to assume that the observed number reflects the expected recombination. If the recombination frequency is x%, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to x. But I'm not sure how to directly compute it from the numbers provided.

Alternatively, maybe the recombination refers to whether the mutations interfere with each other. \n\nThe experiment divides the culture into two halves. One is plated at 1:1e7, meaning fewer cells, so lower chance of multiple infections. The other is 1:1e5, higher chance. If the recombination is high, then the combination might cause more severe effects than either alone. In the case where only strain B is affected, it could indicate that the lysogenic phage didn't interact with the recombination site, while the lysogenic phage did. Or vice versa. Alternatively, the presence of a recombination point would lead to interference between the two mutations, potentially causing some negative outcomes when both are present. \n\nIn the results, strain K has more plumes (40 vs. 4), suggesting that the lysogenic phage from K is less effective when mixed with B's lysogenic phage. This might imply that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination, which reduces their effectiveness together. The exact percentage of recombination can be calculated using the formula involving the number of plumes observed. The formula for estimating recombination frequency (rf) is rf = (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the probability of double recombinant events. However, in this context, it's more about the overlap in plasmids. The number of plumes observed when mixing strains is related to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the individual plume counts multiplied by their probabilities. But since we have two different plume numbers, we can set up equations to solve for the probabilities and hence the rf. \n\nWait, the problem states that both mutation types are present, and only strain B shows significant issues. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is combining with another mutation in strain K. If strain K had its own mutation that interacts with the lysogenic phage, perhaps through recombination, then when both are present, the effect is reduced. The number of plumes depends on the probability of each phage successfully infecting the bacteria. For example, if the lysogenic phage from B has a certain probability of infecting a cell, and the phage from K has another probability, the combined probability would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, if there's a recombination point, the two mutations might interfere, reducing the overall infectivity. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the product of the probabilities of each mutation. Suppose the probability of the lysogenic phage from B infecting a cell is P_b, and from K is P_k. Then the total plumes would be N = P_b * P_k * Total_plated_cells. But since the plating was done at different dilution factors, the actual calculation needs to account for that. At a lower dilution factor (higher plating density), the same number of plumes represent fewer actual events. So, for example, if the lysogenic phage from B infects 100 cells with a probability of 0.05 each, that would give 5 plumes at a certain dilution. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K might have a lower probability, say 0.02, leading to fewer plumes. But wait, in the experiment, the K half showed more plumes, indicating higher probability? Hmm, no, because higher plating density (lower dilution) increases the likelihood of more infections. So if the lysogenic phage from K has a lower probability, it would infect fewer cells, resulting in fewer plumes, but here K has more plumes, so perhaps the phage from K has a higher probability of infecting. Wait, but the phage's probability of infecting is determined by its virulence. Lysogenic phages are generally more virulent than lysogenic ones, so perhaps the K phage has a higher probability. But why would K show more plumes?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of recombination could reduce the effectiveness of both mutations. If the two mutations are recombined, they may interfere, making the overall outcome worse. So when both are present, the number of plumes would be lower than expected if they were independent. Therefore, the ratio of plumes observed can help determine the degree of recombination. The formula for calculating the number of double recombinants (which contribute to the number of plumes) is (2N1 + N2)/4, where N1 and N2 are the numbers of plumes from each strain. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. \n\nLet me consider that the recombination rate affects the number of successful combinations. Each time a mutation occurs, it's independent unless there's a recombination point. The probability of a double recombinant event (both mutations happening) is equal to the product of the probabilities of each mutation minus the product of the probabilities at each end plus twice the product of the recombinant fraction. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the number of plumes observed when mixing two strains can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. So if strain B has a mutation with probability p_b and strain K with p_k, then the expected number of plumes would be p_b * p_k * N, where N is the total number of cells plated. However, in our case, the plating was done at different dilutions, so we need to adjust accordingly. \n\nAt a lower dilution (higher plating density), the same number of plumes represent fewer cells. So if the lysogenic phage from B infects x cells with probability p_b, then at a dilution of 1:1e7, the number of plumes would be x * p_b / (1e7). Similarly, for the lysogenic phage from K, it would infect y cells with probability p_k, resulting in y * p_k / (1e7). The total plumes would be (x*p_b + y*p_k)/(1e7). \n\nBut in our experiment, one half was plated at 1:1e7 and the other at 1:1e5. So for the first half (plated at 1:1e7), the number of plumes is proportional to p_b. For the second half (plated at 1:1e5), the same number of plumes would represent fewer cells, so the observed number of plumes would be lower. Let\u2019s denote N1 as the number of plumes in the first half (1:1e7), and N2 in the second half (1:1e5). \n\nSince N1 corresponds to p_b and N2 corresponds to p_b' * p_k', where p_b' is the probability scaled by the dilution (since N2/N1 = (p_b')/(p_b)) due to the change in dilution factor. Wait, no, because dilution affects the number of cells plated, so N1 = (p_b) * C / (1e7), and N2 = (p_b') * C / (1e5), where C is the number of cells plated. Taking the ratio N2/N1 gives (p_b' / p_b) * (1e5 / 1e7) = (p_b' / p_b) * (1/100). So N2/N1 = (p_b' / p_b) * (1/100). \n\nIf the recombination is r, then p_b' = p_b * (1 - r). Because recombination decreases the probability of double recombinants, thus affecting the overall probability of each mutation. So substituting, N2/N1 = ((p_b)(1 - r))/p_b * (1/100) )= (1 - r)/100. \n\nGiven that in the experiment, the half plated at 1:1e7 (first half) resulted in N1 plumes, and the half plated at 1:1e5 (second half) resulted in N2 plumes. From the data given, four plumes were found on K and 40 on B. Assuming the initial plating is the same for both halves, let's assume that the total number of cells plated is the same for both halves. Let\u2019s denote the total number of cells plated as C. \n\nSo for the first half (1:1e7): N1 = (p_b) * C / (1e7)\nFor the second half (1:1e5): N2 = (p_b * (1 - r)) * C / (1e5)\n\nTaking the ratio N2/N1:\n(N2)/(N1) = [(p_b (1 - r) C / 1e5)] / [p_b C / 1e7] ] \nSimplify: (1 - r) / (1/100) = 100(1 - r)\n\nFrom the experiment, N1 corresponds to four plumes (since four were found on K), and N2 corresponds to 40 plumes (found on B). So N2/N1 = 40/4 = 10.\n\nSetting up the equation: 100(1 - r) = 10 \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9\n\nWait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because r is supposed to be the recombination fraction. If r = 0.9, that's 90%, but looking back at the options, the highest is 0.05 percent, which is 0.0005. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me go back:\n\nWe said N2/N1 = 100(1 - r)\n\nAnd N2 = 40, N1 = 4, so N2/N1 = 10.\n\nThus, 10 = 100(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9\n\nBut none of the options go up to 0.9%. The closest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). So clearly, I messed up.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I should use the formula for the number of plumes when two mutations are present, considering recombination. The formula is: N_total = (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2) + correction terms accounting for recombination. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky.\n\nAnother way is to consider that when two mutations are present, the number of plumes depends on the product of their probabilities, adjusted for any recombination. If there's complete independence, the number of plumes would be N1 + N2. If there's complete dependence (recombination), the number would be less, depending on the extent of dependence.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation is that the number of plumes when both mutations are present would be less than when only one mutation is present. Given that only strain B shows damage, perhaps the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with a recombination point in strain K, reducing the overall efficiency.\n\nWait, going back to the original experiment: Both strains are tested, with different dilutions. Strain B is tested at 1:1e7, giving 4 plumes, and strain K at 1:1e5, giving 40 plumes. The fact that K has more plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage from K is more effective, which contradicts the idea of recombination. Unless... maybe the lysogenic phage from K is not being expressed effectively when recombining, but I don't think that makes sense.\n\nPerhaps I need to calculate the probabilities directly. Let's define p_b as the probability that the lysogenic phage from B infects a cell, and p_k as the probability for K. The expected number of plumes when both are present would be p_b * p_k * N, where N is the total cells plated. But in reality, if there's recombination, the probabilities might be adjusted. Let\u2019s assume that recombination reduces the effectiveness of both mutations. So the observed number of plumes when both are present is p_b * p_k * (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction.\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both are present, only strain B is affected. So the presence of recombination likely caused the lysogenic phage from K to not work as effectively when paired with the lysogenic phage from B.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes when both are present is 40, which is much higher than the individual plumes, which suggests that the recombination significantly reduces the outcome. Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true\u2014when both are present, the lysogenic phages interfere, leading to fewer plumes than expected.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The basic idea is that the number of plumes indicates the probability of each mutation occurring. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be p_b + p_k. But if they're dependent (due to recombination), the expected number could be less. \n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, the total number of plumes is lower than expected if they were independent. The difference between the expected and observed can help determine the level of dependence. \n\nGiven that the result is 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10 times higher, suggesting a strong dependence. To find the recombination fraction, perhaps we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p_b * p_k) / (p_b * (1 - r) + p_k * r)\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure. Another approach is to model the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. If there's recombination, the probability of both mutations happening is reduced. So the expected number of plumes would be (p_b * p_k) * (1 - r). But without knowing the exact values, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of plumes when two mutations are present can be approximated as:\n\nN_total = (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2) + ... some term for recombination.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the best approach is to accept that the presence of recombination leads to a reduction in the number of plumes, and in this case, the increase from 4 to 40 suggests a high degree of dependence. Given the options, 0.05% (option J) is quite low, implying little recombination, whereas 0.1% (option D) is also low. Options like G (0.5%) suggest moderate recombination. However, the large jump from 4 to 40 plumes might correspond to a significant recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try again. The ratio N2/N1 is 10, as established before. And N2/N1 = 100*(1 - r). So 10 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. But this is impossible because the maximum possible recombination is 1. So perhaps I misunderstood the dilution ratios.\n\nWait, maybe the dilution factors affect the number of plumes inversely. Let me clarify: The dilution factor is 1:1e7, meaning 1 part solution to 1e7 parts stock. Plating density is higher, so each well contains more cells, leading to fewer cells per well. Thus, the same number of plumes comes from fewer cells, implying a lower dilution factor. Conversely, a higher dilution factor (lower plating density) means more cells are plated, leading to more plumes. So, perhaps the formula should involve the dilution factors inversely.\n\nLet me redefine N1 and N2 correctly. When plated at 1:1e7, the number of plumes N1 corresponds to the probability p_b. When plated at 1:1e5, N2 corresponds to p_b * (1 - r) because of recombination. The relationship between N1 and N2 should reflect the inverse of the dilution factors. So N2/N1 = (p_b * (1 - r) * C / 1e5) / (p_b * C / 1e7) ) = (1 - r) * (1e7 / 1e5) = (1 - r)*100. \n\nGiven N2/N1 = 10, as before, 10 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. Again, this is impossible because recombination cannot exceed 100%. So perhaps I've got the ratio backwards. Maybe N1/N2 instead? Let me see.\n\nIf N1 is at 1:1e7 and N2 at 1:1e5, then the ratio N1/N2 is (p_b * C / 1e7) / (p_b * C / 1e5) ) = (1/1e7) / (1/1e5) ) = 100. So N1/N2 = 100. But according to the previous assumption, N2/N1 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 100 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 1 \u2192 r=0. Impossible. So clearly, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Instead of trying to relate N1 and N2 directly, perhaps I should consider the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be p_b + p_k. If they are dependent, the expectation would be less. The observed number of plumes is 40 on K and 4 on B, which is a significant drop compared to their individual expectations.\n\nSuppose that the expected number of plumes when both are present is E = p_b * p_k * (1 - r). But I don't know p_b and p_k individually, just their product. Without additional information, it's difficult to compute r directly. However, from the results, the presence of recombination explains the higher number of plumes on K. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination leads to interference between the two mutations, causing less than expected interference. So the observed number of plumes when both are present is less than expected.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only strain B shows significant issues, perhaps the lysogenic phage isn't causing enough damage unless combined with another mutation. Alternatively, maybe the recombination refers to whether the mutations interfere with each other. \n\nThe experiment divides the culture into two halves. One is plated at 1:1e7, meaning fewer cells, so lower chance of multiple infections. The other is 1:1e5, higher chance. If the recombination is high, then the combination might cause more severe effects than either alone. In the case where only strain B is affected, it could indicate that the lysogenic phage didn't interact with the recombination site, while the lysogenic phage did. Or vice versa. Alternatively, the presence of a recombination point would lead to interference between the two mutations, potentially causing some negative outcomes when both are present. \n\nIn the results, strain K has more plumes (40 vs. 4), suggesting that the lysogenic phage from K is less effective when mixed with B's lysogenic phage. This might imply that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination, which reduces their effectiveness together. The exact percentage of recombination can be calculated using the formula involving the number of plumes observed. The formula for estimating recombination frequency (rf) is rf = (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the probability of double recombinant events. However, in this context, it's more about the overlap in plasmids. The number of plumes observed when mixing strains is related to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the individual plume counts multiplied by their probabilities. But since we have two different plume numbers, we can set up equations to solve for the probabilities and hence the rf. \n\nWait, the problem states that both mutation types are present, and only strain B shows significant issues. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is combining with another mutation in strain K. If strain K had its own mutation that interacts with the lysogenic phage, perhaps through recombination, then when both are present, the effect is reduced. The number of plumes depends on the probability of each phage successfully infecting the bacteria. For example, if the lysogenic phage from B has a certain probability of infecting a cell, and the phage from K has another probability, the combined probability would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, if there's a recombination point, the two mutations might interfere, reducing the overall infectivity. \n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can be used to estimate the product of the probabilities of each mutation. Suppose the probability of the lysogenic phage from B infecting a cell is P_b, and from K is P_k. Then the total plumes would be N = P_b * P_k * Total_plated_cells. But since the plating was done at different dilution factors, the actual calculation needs to account for that. At a lower dilution factor (higher plating density), the same number of plumes represent fewer actual events. So, for example, if the lysogenic phage from B infects 100 cells with a probability of 0.05 each, that would give 5 plumes at a certain dilution. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K might have a lower probability, say 0.02, leading to fewer plumes. But wait, in the experiment, the K half showed more plumes, indicating higher probability? Hmm, no, because higher plating density (lower dilution) increases the likelihood of more infections. So if the lysogenic phage from K has a lower probability, it would infect fewer cells, resulting in fewer plumes, but here K has more plumes, so perhaps the phage from K has a higher probability of infecting. Wait, but the phage's probability of infecting is determined by its virulence. Lysogenic phages are generally more virulent than lysogenic ones, so perhaps the K phage has a higher probability. But why would K show more plumes?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of recombination could reduce the effectiveness of both mutations. If the two mutations are recombined, they may interfere, making the overall outcome worse. So when both are present, the number of plumes would be lower than expected if they were independent. Therefore, the ratio of plumes observed can help determine the degree of recombination. The formula for calculating the number of double recombinants (which contribute to the number of plumes) is (2N1 + N2)/4, where N1 and N2 are the numbers of plumes from each strain. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. \n\nLet me consider that the recombination rate affects the number of successful combinations. Each time a mutation occurs, it's independent unless there's a recombination point. The probability of a double recombinant event (both mutations happening) is equal to the product of the probabilities of each mutation minus the product of the probabilities at each end plus twice the product of the recombinant fraction. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the number of plumes observed when mixing two strains can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. So if strain B has a mutation with probability p_b and strain K with p_k, then the expected number of plumes would be p_b * p_k * N, where N is the total number of cells plated. However, in our case, the plating was done at different dilutions, so we need to adjust accordingly. \n\nAt a lower dilution (higher plating density), the same number of plumes represent fewer cells. So if the lysogenic phage from B infects x cells with probability p_b, then at a dilution of 1:1e7, the number of plumes would be x * p_b / (1e7). Similarly, for the lysogenic phage from K, it would infect y cells with probability p_k, resulting in y * p_k / (1e7). The total plumes would be (x*p_b + y*p_k)/(1e7). \n\nBut in our experiment, one half was plated at 1:1e7 and the other at 1:1e5. So for the first half (plated at 1:1e7), the number of plumes is proportional to p_b. For the second half (plated at 1:1e5), the same number of plumes would represent fewer cells, so the observed number of plumes would be lower. Let\u2019s denote N1 as the number of plumes in the first half (1:1e7), and N2 in the second half (1:1e5). \n\nSince N1 corresponds to p_b and N2 corresponds to p_b' * p_k', where p_b' is the probability scaled by the dilution (since N2/N1 = (p_b')/(p_b)) due to the change in dilution factor. Wait, no, because dilution affects the number of cells plated, so N1 = (p_b) * C / (1e7), and N2 = (p_b') * C / (1e5), where C is the number of cells plated. Taking the ratio N2/N1 gives (p_b' / p_b) * (1e5 / 1e7) = (p_b' / p_b) * (1/100). So N2/N1 = (p_b' / p_b) * (1/100). \n\nIf the recombination is r, then p_b' = p_b * (1 - r). Because recombination decreases the probability of double recombinants, thus affecting the overall probability of each mutation. So substituting, N2/N1 = ((p_b)(1 - r))/p_b * (1/100) )= (1 - r)/100. \n\nGiven that in the experiment, the half plated at 1:1e7 (first half) resulted in N1 plumes, and the half plated at 1:1e5 (second half) resulted in N2 plumes. From the data given, four plumes were found on K and 40 on B. Assuming the initial plating is the same for both halves, let's assume that the total number of cells plated is the same for both halves. Let\u2019s denote the total number of cells plated as C. \n\nSo for the first half (1:1e7): N1 = (p_b) * C / (1e7)\nFor the second half (1:1e5): N2 = (p_b * (1 - r)) * C / (1e5)\n\nTaking the ratio N2/N1:\n(N2)/(N1) = [(p_b (1 - r) C / 1e5)] / [p_b C / 1e7] ] \nSimplify: (1 - r) / (1/100) = 100(1 - r)\n\nFrom the experiment, N1 corresponds to four plumes (since four were found on K), and N2 corresponds to 40 plumes (found on B). So N2/N1 = 40/4 = 10.\n\nSetting up the equation: 100(1 - r) = 10 \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9\n\nWait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because r is supposed to be the recombination fraction. If r = 0.9, that's 90%, but looking back at the options, the highest is 0.05 percent, which is 0.0005. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me go back:\n\nWe said N2/N1 = 100(1 - r)\n\nAnd N2 = 40, N1 = 4, so N2/N1 = 10.\n\nThus, 10 = 100(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9\n\nBut none of the options go up to 0.9%. The closest option is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). So clearly, I messed up.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I should use the formula for the number of plumes when two mutations are present, considering recombination. The formula is: N_total = (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2) + correction terms accounting for recombination. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky.\n\nAnother way is to consider that when two mutations are present, the number of plumes depends on the product of their probabilities, adjusted for any recombination. If there's complete independence, the number of plumes would be N1 + N2. If there's complete dependence (recombination), the number would be less, depending on the extent of dependence.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation is that the number of plumes when both mutations are present would be less than when only one mutation is present. Given that only strain B shows damage, perhaps the lysogenic phage from B is interacting with a recombination point in strain K, reducing the overall efficiency.\n\nWait, going back to the original experiment: Both strains are tested, with different dilutions. Strain B is tested at 1:1e7, giving 4 plumes, and strain K at 1:1e5, giving 40 plumes. The fact that K has more plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage from K is more effective, which contradicts the idea of recombination. Unless... maybe the lysogenic phage from K is not being expressed effectively when recombining, but I don't think that makes sense.\n\nPerhaps I need to calculate the probabilities directly. Let's define p_b as the probability that the lysogenic phage from B infects a cell, and p_k as the probability for K. The expected number of plumes when both are present would be p_b * p_k * N, where N is the total cells plated. But in reality, if there's recombination, the probabilities might be adjusted. Let\u2019s assume that recombination reduces the effectiveness of both mutations. So the observed number of plumes when both are present is p_b * p_k * (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction.\n\nBut the experiment shows that when both are present, only strain B is affected. So the presence of recombination likely caused the lysogenic phage from K to not work as effectively when paired with the lysogenic phage from B.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes when both are present is 40, which is much higher than the individual plumes, which suggests that the recombination significantly reduces the outcome. Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true\u2014when both are present, the lysogenic phages interfere, leading to fewer plumes than expected.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The basic idea is that the number of plumes indicates the probability of each mutation occurring. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be p_b + p_k. But if they're dependent (due to recombination), the expected number could be less. \n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, the total number of plumes is lower than expected if they were independent. The difference between the expected and observed can help determine the level of dependence. \n\nGiven that the result is 40 plumes on K and 4 on B, the ratio is 10 times higher, suggesting a strong dependence. To find the recombination fraction, perhaps we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p_b * p_k) / (p_b * (1 - r) + p_k * r)\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure. Another approach is to model the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. If there's recombination, the probability of both mutations happening is reduced. So the expected number of plumes would be (p_b * p_k) * (1 - r). But without knowing the exact values, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of plumes when two mutations are present can be approximated as:\n\nN_total = (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2) + ... some term for recombination.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the best approach is to accept that the presence of recombination leads to a reduction in the number of plumes, and in this case, the increase from 4 to 40 suggests a high degree of dependence. Given the options, 0.05% (option J) is quite low, implying little recombination, whereas 0.1% (option D) is also low. Options like G (0.5%) suggest moderate recombination. However, the large jump from 4 to 40 plumes might correspond to a significant recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try again. The ratio N2/N1 is 10, as established before. And N2/N1 = 100*(1 - r). So 10 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. But this is impossible because the maximum possible recombination is 1. So perhaps I misunderstood the dilution ratios.\n\nWait, maybe the dilution factors affect the number of plumes inversely. Let me clarify: The dilution factor is 1:1e7, meaning 1 part solution to 1e7 parts stock. Plating density is higher, so each well contains more cells, leading to fewer cells per well. Thus, the same number of plumes comes from fewer cells, implying a lower dilution factor. Conversely, a higher dilution factor (lower plating density) means more cells are plated, leading to more plumes. So, perhaps the formula should involve the dilution factors inversely.\n\nLet me redefine N1 and N2 correctly. When plated at 1:1e7, the number of plumes N1 corresponds to the probability p_b. When plated at 1:1e5, N2 corresponds to p_b * (1 - r) because of recombination. The relationship between N1 and N2 should reflect the inverse of the dilution factors. So N2/N1 = (p_b * (1 - r) * C / 1e5) / (p_b * C / 1e7) ) = (1 - r) * (1e7 / 1e5) = (1 - r)*100. \n\nGiven N2/N1 = 10, as before, 10 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9. Again, this is impossible because recombination cannot exceed 100%. So perhaps I've got the ratio backwards. Maybe N1/N2 instead? Let me see.\n\nIf N1 is at 1:1e7 and N2 at 1:1e5, then the ratio N1/N2 is (p_b * C / 1e7) / (p_b * C / 1e5) ) = (1/1e7) / (1/1e5) ) = 100. So N1/N2 = 100. But according to the previous assumption, N2/N1 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 100 = 100*(1 - r) \u2192 1 - r = 1 \u2192 r=0. Impossible. So clearly, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Instead of trying to relate N1 and N2 directly, perhaps I should consider the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. If the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be p_b + p_k. If they are dependent, the expectation would be less. The observed number of plumes is 40 on K and 4 on B, which is a significant drop compared to their individual expectations.\n\nSuppose that the expected number of plumes when both are present is E = p_b * p_k * (1 - r). But I don't know p_b and p_k individually, just their product. Without additional information, it's difficult to compute r directly. However, from the results, the presence of recombination explains the higher number of plumes on K. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination leads to interference between the two mutations, causing less than expected interference. So the observed number of plumes when both are present is less than expected. Given that only strain B shows damage, it implies that the lysogenic phage from B is interfering with the lysogenic phage from K when recombined. \n\nIf the recombination is very low (say, 0.05%), then most of the lysogenic phages work, and only minor interference occurs. But given the large jump from 4 to 40 plumes, it suggests a high degree of interference, implying high recombination.\n\nLooking back at the answer",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",

    "rollout": " In the first case, when only the lysogenic phage is used, all the phages cause lysogeny, leading to significant lytic fission and thus death. So the E. coli should be mostly uninfected because the lysogenic phages do the work. However, when both types are present, some combination might occur\u2014maybe the lysogenic phages take over some of the lysogenic ones, causing some phages to die and others to lyse. Alternatively, perhaps some of the lysogenic phages cause lytic fission while the lysogenic phages themselves lyse. This could lead to some cells being lysed and others remaining, affecting the overall population. The result is that the E. coli show a mix of cases where some are mostly uninfected (because of the lysogenic phages) and some are partially infected (due to the lysogenic phages causing their own death). \n\nThe key here is figuring out the recombination rate. Recombination refers to how often the two mutation types interact. If they don't recombine, then the lysogenic phages would either always lyse (if they're lysogenic) or always cause lysogeny (if they're lysogenic). But since we see some death events, recombination must be occurring. \n\nLooking at the data: When only lysogenic was used, most E. coli died because the phages caused their own replication. But when both were present, some of the lysogenic phages caused lytic fission, meaning those phages killed the host cells. Meanwhile, the lysogenic phages themselves died, so those cells didn't contribute as much. This leads to a situation where some cells are fully lysed, others are partially lysed (due to the lysogenic phages killing some), and some remain uninfected (because the phages were lysogenic and didn't lyse). \n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination frequency (Rf) = (1 - (p + q)) / (1 - p)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of lysogeny (the proportion of cells that are lysed due to the phage), and q is the frequency of lysogeny itself. Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Since in the presence of both mutants, some cells become lysed (lytic fission), others are uninfected, and others are partially lysed. The fraction of cells that are lysed (lytic) would indicate the degree of recombination. \n\nIn the first scenario (only lysogenic), all phages cause lysogeny, so all cells are lysed. In the second scenario (both mutants), some cells are lysed (lytic), some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. The ratio of lysed to uninfected gives us an idea of how much recombination has occurred. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Rf as the recombination frequency.\n- p as the probability that a phage is lysogenic.\n- q as the probability that a phage carries the mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the probabilities. Suppose each phage independently has a certain probability of carrying the mutation. For example, suppose each lysogenic phage has a 50% chance of carrying the mutation. Then, the probability that a cell is lysed is the product of the probability that the phage carried the mutation times the probability that it's lysogenic. Similarly, the probability that the phage isn't lysogenic and doesn't carry the mutation is the complement. \n\nBut this might get complicated. Instead, perhaps using the numbers given. In the first treatment (only lysogenic), all phages cause lysogeny, so all cells are lysed. In the second, some cells are lysed (lytic fission), some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. The number of plumes (infections) observed depends on the balance between these outcomes. \n\nWhen both mutants are present, the distribution of plumes can tell us about the recombination. Specifically, the majority of plumes come from the lysogenic phages themselves, which would cause lytic fission. The minority come from the lysogenically caused death, but wait, no, that's not right. Because when lysogenic phages cause death, they kill the cells, but the lysogenically caused death would also be lysing, but perhaps the timing differs. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this too much. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the ratios: On strain B, four plumes were found, and on strain K, forty. That seems like a 1:10 ratio. Maybe that indicates the relative frequency of different outcomes. Perhaps the majority of cells are lysed (lytic fission) when both mutants are present, but the exact relationship to recombination frequency needs to be established. \n\nAnother approach: The expected number of plumes when both mutants are present would depend on the probabilities of recombination. If there's complete recombination, then every lysogenic phage carries the mutation, leading to maximum recombination. If there's no recombination, then all lysogenic phages cause lysogeny without any recombination. But in reality, we see some recombination because when lysogenic phages lyse, they cause death, leading to some cells being uninfected. \n\nGiven the data, when both mutants are present, the number of plumes on strain B is 4, and on strain K is 40. That's roughly a 1:10 ratio. So perhaps the likelihood of a cell being lysed is 10%, and uninfected is 90%. But how does that relate to recombination? \n\nIf there's no recombination, then all lysogenic phages carry the mutation and cause lysogeny, so all cells would be lysed. But in reality, some cells remain uninfected because the lysogenic phages lyse, which affects the growth rate. Therefore, some cells are partially lysed. The percentage of partially lysed cells relates to the recombination frequency. \n\nPerhaps using the formula for recombination frequency when dealing with multiple loci. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating recombination frequency based on the number of recombinant chromosomes or something similar. Wait, in genetics, the coefficient of coincidence measures the correlation between the occurrence of two independent events. Maybe that's applicable here. \n\nThe coefficient of coincidence C is calculated as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\n\nWhere the total number of offspring is the sum of normal, recombinant, and paratrigamorphic offspring. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here. Alternatively, the formula for coefficient of coincidence in terms of plasmid segregation or something else. \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. The coefficient of coincidence (C) is the ratio of the observed double recombinants (or recombinant colonies) to the expected number of recombinant colonies if the two genes assort independently. It's often expressed as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant colonies) / (expected recombinant colonies)\n\nThe expected recombinant colonies under independence assumption would be:\n\n(1/4) * (N_normal * N_recombinant) * (1/4) ? No, maybe it's different. Wait, let's think again. \n\nIf two genes are assorting independently, the expected number of recombinant gametes is (1/2)(1 - D1)(1 - D2), where D1 and D2 are the fractions of each chromatid type. But perhaps this is getting too detailed. \n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of coincidence is sometimes approximated as the ratio of the number of recombinant individuals to the square root of the product of the number of each parent type. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAnother thought: The coefficient of coincidence is often measured in experiments involving two loci, such as in Drosophila, where crossing-over between two loci occurs randomly and independently. The formula for C is:\n\nC = (number of recombinant individuals) / (number of individuals that came from the same parental line)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence can be estimated as:\n\nC = (observed recombinant plasmids) / (expected recombinant plasmids)\n\nAssuming independence, the expected recombinant plasmids would be proportional to the square root of the product of the proportions of each chromosome type. But I'm still fuzzy on the exact formula.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the information given. We have two strains: B and K. When only lysogenic is used, all cells are lysed. When both are used, some cells are lysed (lytic), some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. The counts are 4 on B and 40 on K. Wait, but the actual plumes correspond to infections, so perhaps the number of plumes (infections) reflects the number of cells that are lysed. Or does it reflect the number of cells that are alive?\n\nWait, perhaps the counts are of plumes, which represent the number of individual cells that have been infected. Each plume represents one cell. So, when only lysogenic is used, all the cells are lysed, so all plumes are on strain B. When both are used, some cells are lysed (lytic fission), some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. The counts are 4 plumes on B and 40 on K. That doesn't make sense because 4 is less than 40. Unless I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the plumes are on the lawn. So, when the cells are plated on strain B's lawn, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that have been infected. Similarly, when the cells are plated on strain K's lawn, the number of plumes corresponds to the number of cells that have been infected. So, if the majority of cells are lysed, then more plumes would be on the respective strain's lawn.\n\nBut the data shows that on strain B, only 4 plumes are found, whereas on strain K, 40 are found. That suggests that when the cells were plated on strain B's lawn, only 4 cells were infected, whereas when they were plated on strain K's lawn, 40 cells were infected. But this seems contradictory because if the cells are growing on strain B's lawn, the presence of more plumes on strain B's lawn would imply more infections on that strain's lawn, which shouldn't happen unless the strain is changing. That makes me think I've misunderstood the experiment.\n\nWait, perhaps the setup is that the T_4 phages are grown on two different bacterial strains, B and K, respectively, in separate plates. When only the lysogenic phage is present, all the phages cause lysogeny, leading to death of the cells. So, on strain B's plate, all cells would die, resulting in zero plumes. On strain K's plate, all cells survive and replicate normally, so all cells are present, leading to all plumes on the K plate. But according to the problem, when both lysogenic and lysogenic are present, the results differ. \n\nHmm, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the lysogenic phages are the same or different. If the lysogenic phages are the same, then when both are present, they cause recombination. But I'm not sure how that translates to the plume counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial plating is done with strain B, and when the phages are present, some cells are lysed (lytic fission), some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. The counts of plumes on each strain's lawn indicate the number of cells that have been infected. The fact that more plumes are found on strain K's lawn despite the expectation suggests that there's a recombination happening, favoring more cells being lysed. \n\nSo, if there's more lysogeny (more plumes on strain K's lawn), that implies that the lysogenic phages have recombined with something. If there's no recombination, then the lysogenic phages would cause lysogeny without any recombination, so more plumes on strain B's lawn. But in our case, more plumes are found on strain K's lawn, indicating more recombination. \n\nNow, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. To find that, we can use the formula for coefficient of coincidence, which is the ratio of the observed recombinant plasmids to the expected recombinant plasmids if the events were independent. \n\nThe formula is:\n\nC = (observed recombinant plasmids) / (expected recombinant plasmids)\n\nUnder the assumption of independence, the expected recombinant plasmids would be:\n\nExpected = (number of cells that resulted in recombination) \u00d7 (probability of recombination)\n\nBut without knowing the specific numbers, perhaps we can estimate based on the ratio of plumes. \n\nWe have 4 plumes on strain B and 40 on strain K, totaling 44 plumes. Assuming that the majority of plumes are due to recombination (since more plumes on K's lawn suggest more lysogeny), perhaps the recombination is high. \n\nUsing the formula for coefficient of coincidence:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (sqrt(number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids))\n\nBut I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, a simpler approximation is:\n\nC \u2248 (number of plumes on K) / (number of plumes on B + number of plumes on K)\n\nWhich would be 40 / (4 + 40) = 40/44 \u2248 0.909. That's very high, suggesting strong recombination. But none of the options go near 90%.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence considering the number of plumes.\n\nThe formula for coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence can be estimated as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nWait, perhaps it's more accurate to say:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nBut I'm still unclear. Maybe I should recall that the coefficient of coincidence is approximately equal to the square root of the ratio of the number of recombinant plasmids to the number of normal plasmids. \n\nGiven that, if the coefficient of coincidence is high, it suggests that the events are dependent, i.e., recombination is occurring frequently. \n\nBut without precise calculations, I'm struggling to get the exact value. However, the possible answers range from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given that, perhaps the calculation involves the ratio of plumes. \n\nAnother angle: The probability of a cell being lysed (lytic fission) when both mutants are present is higher than when only one is present. When only lysogenic is present, all cells are lysed. When both are present, some cells are lysed, some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. \n\nThe number of plumes (infections) would increase if more cells are lysed. So, if more plumes are found on strain K's lawn, that suggests more lysogeny, implying more recombination. \n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the number of plumes on strain K's lawn minus the number on strain B's lawn, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes increases because more cells are lysed (lytic fission). The increase in plumes on strain K compared to strain B could be indicative of recombination. \n\nThe increase from 4 to 40 is 8 times more plumes on K's lawn. If this is due solely to recombination, then the recombination frequency would be related to that ratio. \n\nBut without knowing the exact mathematical relation, it's hard to pinpoint the exact percentage. However, considering the options provided, 0.05% (option F) seems plausible, as it's relatively low but not negligible. Alternatively, 0.02% (option J) might also be close. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of precise formulas, I'll make an educated guess based on typical values. Recombination frequencies in E. coli are usually around 1% to 5%. The data suggests moderate recombination, so option G (0.5%) seems reasonable. But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which would align with a very low level of recombination. \n\nAfter thinking through various possibilities and considering the experimental setup, I believe the answer is likely option G: 0.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first case, when only the lysogenic phage is used, all the phages cause lysogeny, leading to significant lytic fission and thus death. So the E. coli should be mostly uninfected because the lysogenic phages do the work. However, when both types are present, some combination might occur\u2014maybe the lysogenic phages take over some of the lysogenic ones, causing some phages to die and others to lyse.

This could lead to some cells being lysed and others remaining, affecting the overall population. The result is that the E. coli show a mix of cases where some are mostly uninfected (because of the lysogenic phages) and some are partially infected (due to the lysogenic phages causing their own death). \n\nThe key here is figuring out the recombination rate. Recombination refers to how often the two mutation types interact.

Alternatively, a simpler approximation is:\n\nC \u2248 (number of plumes on K) / (number of plumes on B + number of plumes on K)\n\nWhich would be 40 / (4 + 40) = 40/44 \u2248 0.909. That's very high, suggesting strong recombination. But none of the options go near 90%.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence considering the number of plumes.\n\nThe formula for coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence can be estimated as:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nWait, perhaps it's more accurate to say:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nBut I'm still unclear. Maybe I should recall that the coefficient of coincidence is approximately equal to the square root of the ratio of the number of recombinant plasmids to the number of normal plasmids. \n\nGiven that, if the coefficient of coincidence is high, it suggests that the events are dependent, i.e., recombination is occurring frequently. \n\nBut without precise calculations, I'm struggling to get the exact value. However, the possible answers range from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given that, perhaps the calculation involves the ratio of plumes. \n\nAnother angle: The probability of a cell being lysed (lytic fission) when both mutants are present is higher than when only one is present. When only lysogenic is present, all cells are lysed. When both are present, some cells are lysed, some are uninfected, and some are partially lysed. \n\nThe number of plumes (infections) would increase if more cells are lysed. So, if more plumes are found on strain K's lawn, that suggests more lysogeny, implying more recombination. \n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nC = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (number of normal plasmids \u00d7 number of recombining plasmids)\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the number of plumes on strain K's lawn minus the number on strain B's lawn, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes increases because more cells are lysed (lytic fission). The increase in plumes on strain K compared to strain B could be indicative of recombination. \n\nThe increase from 4 to 40 is 8 times more plumes on K's lawn. If this is due solely to recombination, then the recombination frequency would be related to that ratio. \n\nBut without knowing the exact mathematical relation, it's hard to pinpoint the exact percentage. However, considering the options provided, 0.05% (option F) seems plausible, as it's relatively low but not negligible. Alternatively, 0.02% (option J) might also be close. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of precise formulas, I'll make an educated guess based on typical values. Recombination frequencies in E. coli are usually around 1% to 5%. The data suggests moderate recombination, so option G (0.5%) seems reasonable. But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which would align with a very low level of recombination. \n\nAfter thinking through various possibilities and considering the experimental setup, I believe the answer is likely option G: 0.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

On the other hand, the second half has a lower dilution (1e5), so more cells are plated, giving a better chance of multiple infections leading to a higher number of plumes. Since there were 4 on K and 40 on B, that suggests that in the second half, the phages caused more infections, indicating some cooperation or recombination. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, actually, in this scenario, one group was treated with the lysogenic phage and another with the lytic phage, right? Because the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, causing lytic fission. The lytic phage does lyse, causing lysogenic fission. So when the lysogenic phage is present, it kills the E. coli; when the lytic phage is present, it doesn't kill. Now, when both are present, perhaps some of them work together. \n\nBut wait, no\u2014if one phage is lysogenic and the other is lytic, they should interact. When a lysogenic phage attacks, it can lead to lysogenic fission. When a lytic phage attacks, it leads to lytic fission, killing the cell. So when both are present, perhaps the lysogenic phage can take over and cause lysogenic fission, while the lytic phage just kills whatever remains. Or maybe they interfere with each other. \n\nBut in the experiment, the presence of both phages affects the outcome differently depending on which half they're plated on. That makes me think about how their interactions influence the occurrence of lysogeny. If the two phages could potentially interfere with each other, their combined effect would depend on whether they work together or not. \n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The difference is quite large. So, in the half where K was plated, there were 40 plumes, whereas in the B half, it was 4. That suggests that when the K strain was used as the lawn, the phages were more effective at causing lysogeny, i.e., lysing the E. coli. Conversely, when B was used, the phages caused more lysis because the lysogenic phage wasn't interfering. \n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) was working effectively, while the lytic phage (which does lyse) was interfering. Alternatively, it could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't work because it interfered with the lytic phage, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and cause more lysogeny. Hmm, that seems possible. \n\nAnother angle is considering the concept of interference. If the lysogenic phage (L) interferes with the lytic phage (M), then the total effect on lysogeny might be different. Suppose L can inhibit M from replicating. Then, when L is present, even though M can lyse, L might prevent M from doing so. In that case, lysogeny would be reduced because M cannot replicate as much. \n\nAlternatively, if M can lyse without being inhibited, then lysogeny would be enhanced. But in this case, the B strain showed a lot more lysogeny (40 vs. 4), which suggests that when K was used as the lawn, the lysogenic phage didn't interfere. When B was used, the lysogenic phage did interfere, reducing lysogeny. \n\nSo, the ratio of lysogeny in the two cases gives us information about the interaction between the two mutations. Let\u2019s denote the fraction of lysogeny when only lysogenic phage is present as p, and when both are present as q. The observed ratio is 40/4 = 10 times higher when only lysogenic is present compared to when both are present. \n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes depends on the product of the fractions, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present:\nExpected plumes = k * (p)^n, where n is the number of phages.\n\nWhen both are present:\nExpected plumes = k * (q)^m, where m is the number of phages.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship here. Alternatively, if the presence of lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, then the expected number of plumes would decrease multiplicatively. \n\nGiven that, when only lysogenic is present, lysogeny occurs 10 times more often than when both are present. So, if the presence of lysogenic phage reduces lysogeny by a factor of 10, that suggests that the fraction of lysogeny is 1/10 when both are present. \n\nIf we consider that the interaction between the two mutations reduces the likelihood of lysogeny by a certain factor, say x, then the ratio of lysogeny when only lysogenic is present to when both are present would be 1/x. Here, that ratio is 10, so x=10. That implies that the reduction in lysogeny is multiplicative, meaning that the fraction of lysogeny decreases by a factor of 10 due to interaction. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nReduction = (1 - r)^(number of events)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Alternatively, the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of each mutation contributing to lysogeny. If r is the recombination frequency, then the probability of lysogeny is p * q * (1 - r + ...), but I'm not confident about this approach. \n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to calculate the log of the ratio. Taking logs helps linearize multiplicative relationships. So, ln(10) \u2248 2.3026. This tells us that the interaction reduces the likelihood of lysogeny by a factor of 10, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 1%. Because if the interaction reduces the probability by a factor related to the square root of the recombination frequency, or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\n1/p = 1/(p*q*(1 - r)) \n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's easier to recall that a reduction in probability by a factor of 10 corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 1% because the standard deviation of the distribution for independent mutations is sqrt(pq), which for small p and q is roughly equal to pq. So, if the expected number of plumes is inversely proportional to pq, then a reduction by 10 would correspond to a change in pq of 1/10, implying that the recombination frequency is around 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, A is 1%, which fits with this reasoning.

If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nIn the first half, the phages are at a high dilution (1e7), meaning each well has fewer cells.

Alternatively, it could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't work because it interfered with the lytic phage, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate and cause more lysogeny. Hmm, that seems possible. \n\nAnother angle is considering the concept of interference. If the lysogenic phage (L) interferes with the lytic phage (M), then the total effect on lysogeny might be different. Suppose L can inhibit M from replicating. Then, when L is present, even though M can lyse, L might prevent M from doing so. In that case, lysogeny would be reduced because M cannot replicate as much. \n\nAlternatively, if M can lyse without being inhibited, then lysogeny would be enhanced. But in this case, the B strain showed a lot more lysogeny (40 vs. 4), which suggests that when K was used as the lawn, the lysogenic phage didn't interfere. When B was used, the lysogenic phage did interfere, reducing lysogeny. \n\nSo, the ratio of lysogeny in the two cases gives us information about the interaction between the two mutations. Let\u2019s denote the fraction of lysogeny when only lysogenic phage is present as p, and when both are present as q. The observed ratio is 40/4 = 10 times higher when only lysogenic is present compared to when both are present. \n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes depends on the product of the fractions, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present:\nExpected plumes = k * (p)^n, where n is the number of phages.\n\nWhen both are present:\nExpected plumes = k * (q)^m, where m is the number of phages.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship here. Alternatively, if the presence of lysogenic phage reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, then the expected number of plumes would decrease multiplicatively. \n\nGiven that, when only lysogenic is present, lysogeny occurs 10 times more often than when both are present. So, if the presence of lysogenic phage reduces lysogeny by a factor of 10, that suggests that the fraction of lysogeny is 1/10 when both are present. \n\nIf we consider that the interaction between the two mutations reduces the likelihood of lysogeny by a certain factor, say x, then the ratio of lysogeny when only lysogenic is present to when both are present would be 1/x. Here, that ratio is 10, so x=10. That implies that the reduction in lysogeny is multiplicative, meaning that the fraction of lysogeny decreases by a factor of 10 due to interaction. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nReduction = (1 - r)^(number of events)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Alternatively, the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of each mutation contributing to lysogeny. If r is the recombination frequency, then the probability of lysogeny is p * q * (1 - r + ...), but I'm not confident about this approach. \n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to calculate the log of the ratio. Taking logs helps linearize multiplicative relationships. So, ln(10) \u2248 2.3026. This tells us that the interaction reduces the likelihood of lysogeny by a factor of 10, which corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 1%. Because if the interaction reduces the probability by a factor related to the square root of the recombination frequency, or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\n1/p = 1/(p*q*(1 - r)) \n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's easier to recall that a reduction in probability by a factor of 10 corresponds to a recombination frequency of approximately 1% because the standard deviation of the distribution for independent mutations is sqrt(pq), which for small p and q is roughly equal to pq. So, if the expected number of plumes is inversely proportional to pq, then a reduction by 10 would correspond to a change in pq of 1/10, implying that the recombination frequency is around 1%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, A is 1%, which fits with this reasoning. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

That makes sense because the lysogenic phage might interfere with the lysogenic phage's activity. Now, looking at the plate results: one half was plated on strain B's lawn (so expecting more lysogenic phages), but instead, there were 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Wait, no\u2014wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So one half is treated as strain B's lawn, meaning all the phages should be from strain B, right? Because the other half is treated as strain K. Hmm, but in the initial experiment where only lysogenic phages were present, the colonies grew without fissioning, indicating that strain B was primarily lysogenic. Then when both types are present, perhaps the lysogenic phage interacts with the lysogenic phage from the other type, leading to interference. This would reduce the number of phages that successfully infect strain B, resulting in fewer plumes. However, the data shows 40 plumes on B, which seems high compared to the expected 40 if everything worked perfectly, but wait, that might depend on the dilution factors. Wait, let me clarify: the first half is treated as strain B's lawn, so only lysogenic phages should be present, leading to fewer plumes than expected if both types were active. Alternatively, maybe the presence of lysogenic phages affects the lysogenic phage activity. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (from strain B) may die because it's being replicated inside the lysogenic phage from the other type. That would leave only the non-lysogenic phage, which shouldn't affect strain B much, unless the non-lysogenic phage is interfering with another part. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage (strain B) reduces the lysogenic phage's replication capacity, so it cannot replicate, thus reducing the number of lysogenic phages available. If that's the case, then the number of plumes would decrease because fewer lysogenic phages are available to infect strain B. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (strain B) is reduced, causing less lytic activity, hence fewer plumes. Therefore, the ratio of plumes on B to K could indicate the degree of recombination. Since K is presumably lysogenic (as it's not mentioned otherwise), any difference in plumes between K and B could suggest whether the lysogenic phage from B is interfering with the lysogenic phage from K. \n\nThe formula for calculating recombinant plasmid frequency is:\n\nRecombinant Frequency = (1 - (1 - F)(1 - G)) / 100\n\nBut here, we're dealing with plasmid concentrations and their effects on replication. Another approach is to use the ratio of plumes. If the lysogenic phage from B is reduced due to interaction with K's phage, the ratio of plumes on B to K would reflect the level of recombination. Suppose that without interaction, both strains' phages would lead to similar numbers of plumes. With interaction, the effect on one strain (B) would differ from the other (K). Let\u2019s denote the number of plumes on B as P_B and on K as P_K. The ratio P_B / P_K would give us an idea of the effect. For example, if the lysogenic phage from B is reduced because it is being replicated inside K's phage, the number of plumes on B would increase relative to K. Conversely, if K's phage is reduced because it is being replicated inside B's phage, P_K would increase relative to P_B.\n\nLooking at the data: P_B = 40, P_K = 4. So P_B / P_K = 10 times higher on B. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from B is not being inhibited by K's phage but rather K's phage is being inhibited by B's phage. Wait, no\u2014the data says 40 on B and 4 on K, meaning more plumes on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage from B is surviving better in its own environment, while K's phage is being inhibited, leading to fewer plumes on K. That implies that the lysogenic phage from B is not being replicated within the lysogenic phage from K, so the effect is seen as more plumes on B. Thus, the lysogenic phage from B isn't being inhibited by K's phage, meaning that K's phage is not being replicated inside B's phage. Therefore, the interaction is such that the lysogenic phage from B is unaffected by K's phage, and vice versa. This indicates that the two mutation types do not recombine; they are independent. But wait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations, so if they don't recombine, the recombination rate should be zero. However, the options provided include small percentages like 0.05%, which suggests that recombination is occurring at a low rate. Maybe my reasoning is off. Perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage from B reduces the replication efficiency of K's phage, leading to fewer plumes on K. If that's the case, then P_K would decrease relative to P_B. Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true: the lysogenic phage from K is being inhibited by B's phage, leading to more plumes on B and fewer on K. Wait, the data shows 40 on B and 4 on K, so more on B. So that supports the idea that the lysogenic phage from B is not being inhibited by K's phage, implying that K's phage is being inhibited by B's phage. But if B's phage inhibits K's phage, then the effect would be that K's phage becomes less effective, leading to fewer plumes on K. So P_K decreases relative to P_B. Therefore, the presence of B's phage affects K's phage, leading to fewer plumes on K. How does this relate to recombination? Recombination typically refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different species. Here, if the two phages share a recombination point, their interaction would prevent one from replicating inside the other. If they don't recombine, their interactions wouldn't matter. But according to the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phage from B affects the replication of lysogenic phage from K, leading to fewer plumes on K. That suggests that K's phage is being inhibited by B's phage. How does that happen? Phages often transfer plasmids through conjugation, but in this scenario, it's about replication within each other. Perhaps they interact via a plasmid exchange mechanism. If the two phages have a common recombination point, the phage carrying the mutation from B would have a copy of the mutation from K. So when the lysogenic phage from B tries to replicate inside the lysogenic phage from K, it can't because they share a common mutation. That would cause the replication of the lysogenic phage from K to fail, leading to fewer plumes on K. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K trying to replicate inside the lysogenic phage from B would also fail, leading to fewer plumes on B. Wait, but in our case, the lysogenic phage from B is not inhibited by K's phage, so perhaps the reverse happens. Or maybe only one side is inhibited. Let me clarify. If B's phage inhibits K's phage replication, then K's phage would be less likely to replicate, leading to fewer plumes on K. Conversely, if K's phage inhibits B's phage replication, then B's phage would be less likely to replicate, leading to fewer plumes on B. According to the data, there are more plumes on B than on K, which suggests that K's phage is less likely to replicate. So if B's phage is inhibiting K's phage, then K's phage replication is reduced, leading to fewer plumes on K. Therefore, the presence of B's phage inhibits K's phage replication. Now, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination occurs when the two phages share a common mutation. If they do, the phage carrying the mutation from B would have a copy of the mutation from K. Therefore, when the lysogenic phage from B (which has the B mutation) tries to replicate inside the lysogenic phage from K (with the K mutation), it can't because the two phages share a mutation. This would cause the lysogenic phage from K to fail to replicate, leading to fewer plumes on K. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K (with the K mutation) would try to replicate inside the lysogenic phage from B (with the B mutation), and if they share a mutation, it would also fail. However, in our case, only the lysogenic phage from B is affecting K's replication, so maybe the K phage isn't sharing a mutation with B phage. Wait, no\u2014if they share a mutation, then both would face the same problem. So perhaps the presence of B's phage affects K's phage replication, but not vice versa. That would imply that the K phage doesn't share a mutation with B phage, meaning there's no recombination between them. But the question states that the two phages are mutants, and we're supposed to determine the recombination between them. Alternatively, maybe the presence of one phage affects the replication of the other, but doesn't necessarily involve recombination. So perhaps the observed effect is due to competition for resources or something else, but not recombination. Therefore, the recombination rate would be zero. Looking back at the options, D is 0.05% and J is 0.05%. However, the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome. If there's no recombination, the answer would be D or J. But the options are labeled A to H, with specific percentages. So the correct answer would be either D or J, depending on the exact calculation. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the ratio of plumes. If the ratio is 40/4=10, then the recombination rate is approximately 1/(1 + ratio)= ~9.1%, but that doesn't match any option. Alternatively, using the formula for recombination fraction: r \u2248 (number of recombinant offspring)/(total number of offspring). But in this case, the total number of offspring would be roughly (P_B + P_K)/10^7, assuming dilution. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, considering the plume counts, if the lysogenic phage from B is not being inhibited by K's phage, then the number of plumes on B is higher, indicating that the lysogenic phage from B is not being inhibited, implying no recombination. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero, which corresponds to option D (0.05%) or J (0.05%). However, since the options are in percentages, and none of them say \"zero\", perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage from B affects the replication of the lysogenic phage from K, indicating a certain level of interference. If the presence of the B phage reduces the replication of K's phage, it suggests that the K phage is being replicated within a copy of the B phage. But if the two phages share a mutation, the B phage would have a copy of the K phage mutation, making replication impossible. However, if the two phages don't share a mutation, then the B phage's presence would just cause some competition, but not directly inhibit K's phage replication. So maybe the presence of B's phage causes some disruption, leading to fewer plumes on K, but not necessarily recombination. Therefore, the recombination rate remains zero, so the answer would be D (0.05%) or J (0.05%). Since the options are given in letters, and the question asks for the amount of recombination, which is zero, perhaps the closest option is D (0.05%), but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe the recombination rate is calculated differently. Let me think again. The recombination rate is usually expressed as the percentage of double-stranded regions that contain two copies of a particular gene. In this context, it's the rate of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If the two mutations are independent, recombination is zero. If they are linked, recombination is positive. However, the experiment shows that the presence of one phage affects the replication of the other, suggesting some form of interaction, possibly recombination. But in reality, if they don't share a mutation, there's no recombination. So the recombination rate is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is D (0.05%) or J (0.05%).

That suggests a lot of phages are infecting the bacteria, so the phage concentrations must be high enough to affect the growth.\n\nThe second part is a lower dilution factor, 1:1e5. Plating more cells (since lower dilution factor means more cells are plated), so a higher concentration of phages. This part resulted in 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. So, when the phages are more concentrated, the number of successful infections decreases. So, higher concentration leads to fewer infections.\n\nPutting it together, the experiments suggest that when the phages are more concentrated, the number of successful infections drops. This behavior is consistent with interference between the two mutations. Interference occurs when the effects of one mutation negate or reduce the effect of another. In this case, the lysogenic phage (with lys operon active) might interfere with the lysosomal repressor from the lysogenic phage, reducing its effectiveness. Similarly, the lysogeny mutation might interfere with the ability of the phage to integrate into the host DNA.\n\nTo quantify the recombination, I think we need to use the formula related to interference in genetic tests. The formula is:\n\nNumber of observed double recombinants = (number of single recombinants * r) / (total number of recombinants)\n\nBut in this context, it's about interference. The probability of two mutations interfering is given by the coefficient of coincidence (COI). COI is calculated as the ratio of the observed double recombinants to the product of the frequencies of the two individual recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, the formula relating the number of recombinants to the frequency of the mutations is:\n\nExpected number of recombinants = (frequency of first mutation) \u00d7 (frequency of second mutation) \u00d7 (total number of colonies)\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Maybe a simpler approach is needed. Since the phages are at different dilutions, we can calculate the expected number of successful infections based on the concentrations and the probabilities of each mutation causing failure.\n\nWhen both mutations are present, the phage must successfully cross-link both genes to infect the host. If they interfere, the overall success rate is reduced compared to when each mutation works independently.\n\nGiven that when both are present, the total number of successful infections is higher than expected if they worked separately, this implies some degree of interference. To find the recombination frequency, which measures how often the two mutations interfere, we can use the following formula:\n\nRecombinant Frequency (RF) = 1 - e^{-2p}\n\nWhere p is the probability of a single mutation causing failure. However, when considering interference, the formula becomes:\n\nCOI = [observed frequency of double recombinants] / [expected frequency under independence]\n\nIf the observed frequency is less than expected, the COI is greater than 1, indicating negative interference. Negative interference is common in genetic systems where two mutations are tightly linked.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the expected number of successful infections based on the concentrations and the probabilities of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- c1 = concentration of lysogenic phage\n- c2 = concentration of lysosomal repressor phage\n- c_total1 = c1 / 1e7 (since the first part is dilution 1:1e7)\n- c_total2 = c2 / 1e5 (second part is dilution 1:1e5)\n\nAssuming that both mutations interfere, the total failure rate is the product of the failure rates of each mutation. The observed number of plumes is proportional to the number of failures. \n\nLet\u2019s assume that the probability of failure for each mutation is p1 and p2 respectively. Due to interference, the actual failure rate is p1 * p2 * (1 + r), where r is the coefficient of coincidence. However, in our case, the interactions may complicate things.\n\nAnother way is to look at the number of plumes. The first part, with lower concentration (c_total1), has 40 plumes. The second part, higher concentration (c_total2), has 4 plumes. Assuming the same plasmid load, the concentration affects the likelihood of infection. The relationship between concentration and plume count is roughly linear.\n\nSo, if at low concentration (1:1e7), 40 plumes are seen, and at high concentration (1:1e5), 4 plumes are seen, we can model this as the product of concentrations being proportional to the square of the number of plumes? Or perhaps using the inverse square law, where the number of plumes squared equals the concentration.\n\nWait, the number of plumes (n) is inversely proportional to the concentration (c). Because n = k / c, where k is a constant. So if n1 = 40 and n2 = 4,\n\nn1 / n2 = (k / c1) / (k / c2) ) = c2 / c1\n\nSo 40/4 = c2/c1 \u2192 10 = c2/c1 \u2192 c2 = 10 c1\n\nWhich makes sense because c2 is at a higher concentration (lower dilution, higher concentration). Now, assuming that the events are independent, the expected number of plumes would be n_expected = sqrt(n1 * n2). Because if events are independent, the total plumes would be the geometric mean of the two concentrations. \n\nBut in reality, due to interference, the number of plumes increases beyond the square root. So the observed number (n_obs) relates to the expected number (n_exp) via the coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nn_obs = n_exp * COI\n\nWe have n_obs1 = 40, n_obs2 = 4, and n_exp1 = sqrt(40*4)=sqrt(160)=approx 12.649, n_exp2= sqrt(4*40)=same.\n\nThen, COI1 = 40 / 12.649 \u2248 3.16\n\nCOI2 = 4 / 12.649 \u2248 0.316\n\nNegative interference is indicated by COI </think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nWait, perhaps it's a test for recombinant systems. In phage genetics, when two mutations interfere, their combination might lead to different outcomes than expected. For example, if the lysogenic phage (which usually has a lys operon active) doesn't interact with the lysosomal repressor from the lysogenic phage, then the presence of lysogeny would cause issues. Alternatively, if they recombine, they might produce a double-stranded RNA that can integrate better, leading to different outcomes.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutation types are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other. If they do interfere, the combined effect could be either synergistic (both good) or antagonistic (one bad, the other neutral). But in this case, the result was that the strain B shows half as much damage as strain K. Hmm, no, wait. The initial setup says that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. Then they split it into two parts: one part (diluted 1:1e7) is plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in a certain number of plumes, and another part (diluted 1:1e5) is plated on strain K's lawn, giving 4 plumes on K and 40 on B.\n\nSo the first part (diluted 1:1e7) is expecting to see more plumes because it's less concentrated, meaning fewer cells are exposed to the phage. If the phages are effective, more plumes should occur. However, if the phages don't work well, there would be fewer. But here, we're seeing 40 plumes on strain B, which is quite high\u2014plumes represent successful infections. That suggests a lot of phages are infecting the bacteria, so the phage concentrations must be high enough to affect the growth.\n\nThe second part is a lower dilution factor, 1:1e5. Plating more cells (since lower dilution factor means more cells are plated), so a higher concentration of phages. This part resulted in 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. So, when the phages are more concentrated, the number of successful infections decreases.

Normally, if you have two phages with recombining mutations, their combined effect can either be synergistic (both work together) or antagonistic (they oppose each other). In this case, the presence of lysogenic phages is causing issues, while wild-type phages don't. So when both types are present, maybe the lysogenic ones take over, leading to the observed result. However, the specific numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Wait, no\u2014the first sample was on B, and the second on K. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states that both types of mutantphage are present when infecting strain B. Then, half is diluted 1:1e7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on strain K's lawn, giving 4 plumes. The total number of colonies would depend on the dilution factor and the initial concentration of phages. Wait, no\u2014since it's a plate, the actual number of plumes depends on the probability of each phage infecting its target. For example, if you dilute the phage solution 1:1e5, each bacterium has a much higher chance of being infected than at 1:1e7. So the expected number of plumes would be higher at 1:1e5. But here, we're seeing 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems inconsistent because the plumes on B would be fewer due to the lower dilution factor. Unless... wait, maybe the initial concentrations aren't equal? Or perhaps the experiment is set up differently. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without any phage, there are 10^9 bacteria. Each bacterium can take up one phage. When you dilute the phage solution 1:1e5, each bacterium now has 1e-5 phages. The probability of a bacterium taking up a phage is approximately 1e-5 (using Poisson approximation). Similarly, at 1:1e7, each bacterium has 1e-7 phages, with a probability of 1e-7. \n\nNow, suppose that each phage carries a mutation in either the lysogenic or recombine region. In the case of lysogenic phages, they do not lyse the cell, while in the recombine region, they may interfere. When both types are present, perhaps the lysogenic phages disrupt the recombine phages, or vice versa. Alternatively, the combination could lead to increased activity or decreased activity.\n\nBut wait, the result is 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the strain K's lawn had more infections, but that's counterintuitive unless the phages are interacting. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phages are killing the recombine phages, thus reducing the number of recombine phages available for other interactions. So if strain B has both types, some lysogenic phages might kill the recombine ones, leaving only the wild-type phages, which then cause the lytic fission. Therefore, the lysogenic phages reduce the number of recombine phages, allowing the wild-type ones to infect more, hence more plumes on K.\n\nSo the key here is that the lysogenic phages are interfering with the recombine ones, thereby reducing their effective population. This leads to a decrease in the number of plumes caused by recombine phages on strain B, and possibly an increase on strain K if K is less affected or if the interference is stronger against K.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn this context, the \"offspring\" would correspond to the number of plumes. However, since we have two groups (plated on B and K), we might need to calculate the recombination rate between the two mutation types across the two populations.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compare the number of plumes from the two samples. Strain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. This suggests that the lysogenic phage reduces the number of recombine phages, making strain K's lawn more susceptible to lysogenic phages, hence fewer plumes. Conversely, strain B's lawn has more recombine phages because lysogenic ones are killed off, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf I denote R as the recombination frequency (the proportion of recombine phages), then the fraction of phages carrying the recombine mutation is R. However, in our case, the lysogenic phages (which carry a mutation in the recombine region) are likely killing the recombine ones, so the remaining recombine phages are those that didn't get killed. Wait, but in reality, the lysogenic phages themselves may carry mutations, but they don't lyse, so perhaps they're not affecting the recombine phages. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.\n\nPerhaps another way is to look at the ratio of plumes. On strain B, we have 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. So the plume density is 1/10th on K compared to B. If the recombination is occurring, then the presence of lysogenic phages (which are non-recombinants) affects the recombine ones. So the number of plumes on strain B would be reduced by the presence of recombine phages that are killed by lysogenic phages. Therefore, if Y is the number of recombinant plumes, then the number on B would be Y*(1 - r), where r is the recombination rate. Similarly, on K, the number would be Y*(1 + r), assuming that the lysogenic phages don't affect K as much. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, it suggests that the presence of recombine phages (or their mutants) is reducing the number of plumes on B. So if R is the recombination rate, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to (1 - R), and on K, it would be proportional to (1 + R). But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAnother angle is to consider that the presence of lysogenic phages reduces the recombine ones, thereby decreasing the number of plumes on strain B. If the initial number of recombine phages is N, then after accounting for the lysogenic ones, the number becomes N*(1 - R). Suppose that the original number of plumes on B would have been P. Now, with the lysogenic ones, the number becomes P*(1 - R), which equals 40. And on K, it's P*(1 + R) = 4. But this seems too simplistic because we don't know P, the initial number of plumes without any phage. Perhaps instead, we should think in terms of probabilities.\n\nEach bacterium has a certain probability of being infected by each type of phage. Without phages, all bacteria survive. With lysogenic phages, each bacterium has a probability p of being infected. Similarly, with recombine phages, each bacterium has a probability q of being infected. The overall probability of infection is p + q - pq (assuming independence). Therefore, the expected number of plumes (infections) would be proportional to (p + q - pq).\n\nGiven that, the number of plumes on B is proportional to (p_B + q_B - p_B*q_B), and on K, proportional to (p_K + q_K - p_K*q_K). From the problem, we have 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Assuming that the initial concentrations of lysogenic and recombine phages are such that the total plumes on B and K relate inversely to their respective probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment shows that the presence of lysogenic phages increases the chance of recombine phages being killed, thereby reducing the number of recombine phages available for other interactions. So if the lysogenic phages are present, the recombine ones are reduced, leading to fewer plumes on strain B and more on strain K.\n\nBut I'm still a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation. Maybe I should recall the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. It's defined as C = (P1*P2)/(P_total), where P1 is the probability of first event, P2 the second, and P_total the combined probability. If events are independent, C=1; otherwise, it's less than 1.

However, since we have two groups (plated on B and K), we might need to calculate the recombination rate between the two mutation types across the two populations.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compare the number of plumes from the two samples. Strain B has 40 plumes, and strain K has 4. This suggests that the lysogenic phage reduces the number of recombine phages, making strain K's lawn more susceptible to lysogenic phages, hence fewer plumes. Conversely, strain B's lawn has more recombine phages because lysogenic ones are killed off, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf I denote R as the recombination frequency (the proportion of recombine phages), then the fraction of phages carrying the recombine mutation is R. However, in our case, the lysogenic phages (which carry a mutation in the recombine region) are likely killing the recombine ones, so the remaining recombine phages are those that didn't get killed. Wait, but in reality, the lysogenic phages themselves may carry mutations, but they don't lyse, so perhaps they're not affecting the recombine phages. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.\n\nPerhaps another way is to look at the ratio of plumes. On strain B, we have 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4. The ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. So the plume density is 1/10th on K compared to B. If the recombination is occurring, then the presence of lysogenic phages (which are non-recombinants) affects the recombine ones. So the number of plumes on strain B would be reduced by the presence of recombine phages that are killed by lysogenic phages. Therefore, if Y is the number of recombinant plumes, then the number on B would be Y*(1 - r), where r is the recombination rate. Similarly, on K, the number would be Y*(1 + r), assuming that the lysogenic phages don't affect K as much. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th of B, it suggests that the presence of recombine phages (or their mutants) is reducing the number of plumes on B. So if R is the recombination rate, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to (1 - R), and on K, it would be proportional to (1 + R). But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAnother angle is to consider that the presence of lysogenic phages reduces the recombine ones, thereby decreasing the number of plumes on strain B. If the initial number of recombine phages is N, then after accounting for the lysogenic ones, the number becomes N*(1 - R). Suppose that the original number of plumes on B would have been P. Now, with the lysogenic ones, the number becomes P*(1 - R), which equals 40. And on K, it's P*(1 + R) = 4. But this seems too simplistic because we don't know P, the initial number of plumes without any phage. Perhaps instead, we should think in terms of probabilities.\n\nEach bacterium has a certain probability of being infected by each type of phage. Without phages, all bacteria survive. With lysogenic phages, each bacterium has a probability p of being infected. Similarly, with recombine phages, each bacterium has a probability q of being infected. The overall probability of infection is p + q - pq (assuming independence). Therefore, the expected number of plumes (infections) would be proportional to (p + q - pq).\n\nGiven that, the number of plumes on B is proportional to (p_B + q_B - p_B*q_B), and on K, proportional to (p_K + q_K - p_K*q_K). From the problem, we have 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Assuming that the initial concentrations of lysogenic and recombine phages are such that the total plumes on B and K relate inversely to their respective probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment shows that the presence of lysogenic phages increases the chance of recombine phages being killed, thereby reducing the number of recombine phages available for other interactions. So if the lysogenic phages are present, the recombine ones are reduced, leading to fewer plumes on strain B and more on strain K.\n\nBut I'm still a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation. Maybe I should recall the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. It's defined as C = (P1*P2)/(P_total), where P1 is the probability of first event, P2 the second, and P_total the combined probability. If events are independent, C=1; otherwise, it's less than 1.

However, when both are present, maybe their combined effect creates a new mutation that's even worse, requiring even more plasmids to infect, hence fewer plumes.\n\nWait, but in this case, both mutation types are present, so the lysogenic phage would have its own mutations, which could either enhance or interfere with the wild-type. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that reduces susceptibility to the wild-type phage, then together they might produce a more potent phage. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage's mutation enhances the lysogenic activity, maybe that's why it kills strain B, while the wild-type is unaffected.

The formula I remember is related to the number of recombinant offspring versus the total possible. Since we're dealing with two independent mutations (mutants from each phage), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombinant = (Number of recombinant plasmids / Total plasmids) * 100%\n\nBut wait, in this case, the phages themselves cause lytic or lysogenic fission. So when they combine, perhaps they form a double mutant. The experiment shows that some bacteria have both mutations, meaning they are resistant to both types of phages. The number of resistant bacteria should correspond to the proportion of phages that caused a double mutation. \n\nIn the first experiment, all the cells in the 1:1e7 dilution have been treated with only the lysogenic phage, so any resistance would come from the second experiment, where both phages are present. However, the initial results show that only a quarter of the colonies grew (since 40 out of 100000 plates had plumes on strain B, which seems low; wait, no, the numbers are confusing. Let me parse the data again.)\n\nWait, the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is \"mostly\" affected, implying some recombination. The results are as follows: half of the plate was plated on strain B (so the original sample is strain B, and the other half is a mixture? Or wait, no\u2014when the phages are mixed, the initial treatment is on half of the plate (the original sample), while the other half is a separate mixture. No, wait, the way it's worded is: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So both halves are plates of strain B, but one has a mix of both phages (diluted 1:1e5) and the other has only the lysogenic phage (diluted 1:1e7). \n\nThen, the results are: 4 plumes on K (from the second half) and 40 on B (from the first half). Plumes indicate successful infection events. So 40 plumes on B mean that 40% of the colonies on the B plate were successfully infected. Similarly, 4 plumes on K mean 4% of the K plate were infected. But since both plates are of strain B, how do these relate?\n\nWait, no. The first half (lysogenic phage) was plated on strain B's lawn, expecting high infection rates because only lysogenic phages are present. However, the second half (both phages) was plated on strain K's lawn, expecting some interaction or recombination leading to some resistance to both phages. \n\nSo the number of plumes on B (40) indicates that 40% of the B plate was successfully infected with the lysogenic phage alone. On the K plate, 4 plumes indicate that 4% of the K plate was successfully infected with both phages. \n\nSince the two experiments are independent, we can model the probability of recombination. The number of plumes corresponds to the probability of successful infection. For the lysogenic-only condition, the probability p1 is 40/100000 = 0.0004. For the double phage condition, p2 is 4/100000 = 0.00004. \n\nAssuming that the presence of both phages leads to recombination, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be the product of these probabilities, considering independence. So recombinant plasmids = p1 * p2 = 0.0004 * 0.00004 = 1.6e-9. \n\nBut wait, the actual number of recombinant plasmids observed is zero because the phages are causing some recombination but not necessarily producing a significant number. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the percentage of cells that are resistant. If 40% of B plate is resistant, then 40% of the cells are resistant to lysogenic phage alone. Similarly, 4% of K plate is resistant to both phages. \n\nIf we assume that the presence of both phages leads to a 4% reduction in resistance compared to just the lysogenic phage, then the recombination frequency would be approximately 4%, but looking at the options, the closest is F. 0.3 percent, which is around 0.3%. However, my calculation gave 1.6e-9, which is practically zero, suggesting no significant recombination. But the data shows that on the K plate, 4 plumes (4%) occurred, indicating that 4% of the K population was resistant to both phages, whereas on the B plate, only 40% was resistant to the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is about 4%, but the answer choices don't include 4%. The highest option is G. 0.5 percent, followed by F. 0.3 percent. Since 4% isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the ratio of the plumes. The number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So 40 vs. 4 implies a ratio of 10:1. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher than the probability of the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (q), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be q = p1 + p2 - pq. Assuming p1 = 0.0004 and p2 = 0.00004, then q \u2248 0.0004 + 0.00004 - (0.0004*0.00004) \u2248 0.000404. But this seems too small. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to take the ratio of the plumes. Since on the B plate, 40 plumes (resistant to lysogenic) and on K plate, 4 plumes (resistant to both), the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is about 10 times higher than the probability of the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nGiven the options, 0.5 percent (G) is close to 10 times 0.05 percent, but without exact calculations, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nBut the total plasmids would be the sum of the resistant cells to lysogenic and resistant to double phage. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is given by the ratio of plumes on K to B. Since on K, 4 plumes (resistant to both) occur where on B, 40 plumes (resistant to lysogenic) occur. The ratio is 1:10. Thus, the recombination frequency is 10 times higher than the lysogenic alone. \n\nLooking back, the lysogenic alone has 40 plumes, and the combination has 4. So 4 is 10 times less than 40, suggesting that the recombination frequency is 10% of the lysogenic alone, which would be 0.4% (approximately 0.5%).

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first half, only the lysogenic phage is used, so only those would cause lysis. Then, in the second half, both phages are present. However, the presence of both might lead to some recombination where the phages interact, possibly leading to a double mutation. That could explain why some bacteria have both mutations, leading to a failure to lyse the host.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out the recombination frequency. The formula I remember is related to the number of recombinant offspring versus the total possible. Since we're dealing with two independent mutations (mutants from each phage), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombinant = (Number of recombinant plasmids / Total plasmids) * 100%\n\nBut wait, in this case, the phages themselves cause lytic or lysogenic fission. So when they combine, perhaps they form a double mutant. The experiment shows that some bacteria have both mutations, meaning they are resistant to both types of phages. The number of resistant bacteria should correspond to the proportion of phages that caused a double mutation. \n\nIn the first experiment, all the cells in the 1:1e7 dilution have been treated with only the lysogenic phage, so any resistance would come from the second experiment, where both phages are present. However, the initial results show that only a quarter of the colonies grew (since 40 out of 100000 plates had plumes on strain B, which seems low; wait, no, the numbers are confusing. Let me parse the data again.)\n\nWait, the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is \"mostly\" affected, implying some recombination. The results are as follows: half of the plate was plated on strain B (so the original sample is strain B, and the other half is a mixture? Or wait, no\u2014when the phages are mixed, the initial treatment is on half of the plate (the original sample), while the other half is a separate mixture. No, wait, the way it's worded is: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So both halves are plates of strain B, but one has a mix of both phages (diluted 1:1e5) and the other has only the lysogenic phage (diluted 1:1e7). \n\nThen, the results are: 4 plumes on K (from the second half) and 40 on B (from the first half). Plumes indicate successful infection events. So 40 plumes on B mean that 40% of the colonies on the B plate were successfully infected. Similarly, 4 plumes on K mean 4% of the K plate were infected. But since both plates are of strain B, how do these relate?\n\nWait, no. The first half (lysogenic phage) was plated on strain B's lawn, expecting high infection rates because only lysogenic phages are present. However, the second half (both phages) was plated on strain K's lawn, expecting some interaction or recombination leading to some resistance to both phages. \n\nSo the number of plumes on B (40) indicates that 40% of the B plate was successfully infected with the lysogenic phage alone. On the K plate, 4 plumes indicate that 4% of the K plate was successfully infected with both phages. \n\nSince the two experiments are independent, we can model the probability of recombination. The number of plumes corresponds to the probability of successful infection. For the lysogenic-only condition, the probability p1 is 40/100000 = 0.0004. For the double phage condition, p2 is 4/100000 = 0.00004. \n\nAssuming that the presence of both phages leads to recombination, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be the product of these probabilities, considering independence. So recombinant plasmids = p1 * p2 = 0.0004 * 0.00004 = 1.6e-9. \n\nBut wait, the actual number of recombinant plasmids observed is zero because the phages are causing some recombination but not necessarily producing a significant number. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the percentage of cells that are resistant. If 40% of B plate is resistant, then 40% of the cells are resistant to lysogenic phage alone. Similarly, 4% of K plate is resistant to both phages. \n\nIf we assume that the presence of both phages leads to a 4% reduction in resistance compared to just the lysogenic phage, then the recombination frequency would be approximately 4%, but looking at the options, the closest is F. 0.3 percent, which is around 0.3%. However, my calculation gave 1.6e-9, which is practically zero, suggesting no significant recombination. But the data shows that on the K plate, 4 plumes (4%) occurred, indicating that 4% of the K population was resistant to both phages, whereas on the B plate, only 40% was resistant to the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is about 4%, but the answer choices don't include 4%. The highest option is G. 0.5 percent, followed by F. 0.3 percent. Since 4% isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the ratio of the plumes. The number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So 40 vs. 4 implies a ratio of 10:1. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher than the probability of the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (q), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be q = p1 + p2 - pq. Assuming p1 = 0.0004 and p2 = 0.00004, then q \u2248 0.0004 + 0.00004 - (0.0004*0.00004) \u2248 0.000404. But this seems too small. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to take the ratio of the plumes. Since on the B plate, 40 plumes (resistant to lysogenic) and on K plate, 4 plumes (resistant to both), the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is about 10 times higher than the probability of the lysogenic phage alone. \n\nGiven the options, 0.5 percent (G) is close to 10 times 0.05 percent, but without exact calculations, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids)\n\nBut the total plasmids would be the sum of the resistant cells to lysogenic and resistant to double phage. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is given by the ratio of plumes on K to B. Since on K, 4 plumes (resistant to both) occur where on B, 40 plumes (resistant to lysogenic) occur. The ratio is 1:10. Thus, the recombination frequency is 10 times higher than the lysogenic alone. \n\nLooking back, the lysogenic alone has 40 plumes, and the combination has 4. So 4 is 10 times less than 40, suggesting that the recombination frequency is 10% of the lysogenic alone, which would be 0.4% (approximately 0.5%). Looking at the options, G is 0.5 percent, which fits. Therefore, the answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

However, the results show that 40% of the B lawn and 4% of the K lawn are positive. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the steps again. The main process is that when two different phage mutants are mixed, their effect depends on whether they interact or recombine. If they don't recombine, the effects might be additive or independent. If they do recombine, the overall effect could be either synergistic (both beneficial) or antagonistic (one bad, the other good). \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage alone leads to half of the E. coli being lysed. When both are present, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, which is less than half, suggesting that the presence of the lysogenic phage inhibits its own activity. This makes sense because lysogenic phages typically cause lysing rather than lysogeny. So adding another type of phage should reduce the number of lysed cells. Now, looking at the second part: half the B lawn is treated with both mutated phages, and half with K. The K lawn has 4 plumes, while the B lawn has 40. Wait, no, perhaps I got the halves wrong. Let me try again. The main plate is split into two equal parts: one part is treated with both mutant phages (so both mutations are present), and the other part is treated with K. Each part is then diluted differently before plating onto strain B and K respectively. On the B side, 4 plumes appear, and on the K side, 40 plumes appear. Since the initial plate was split into two, each with a certain dilution factor, the probabilities would depend on those dilutions. \n\nLet me model this. Suppose the probability of a phage attacking the E. coli is p. For the lysogenic phage alone, the probability of causing lytic fission (and thus lysing the cell) is q. When both phages are present, the combined probability of attack is p1 + p2 - p1*p2, assuming independence. However, if they recombine, the effective probability becomes p * (q + r - q*r), where r is the recombination fraction. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently.\n\nThe experiment measures the frequency of successful infections. When only lysogenic is present, half the colonies are lysed, meaning the lysogenic phage must have a high success rate. When both phages are present, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, which is 40% of the colony count, implying that the lysogenic phage's effect is reduced. Similarly, on the K lawn, 4 plumes out of 100,000 colonies, which is much lower. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is significantly reducing its own effectiveness when another phage is present. \n\nNow, considering the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If the two phages act independently without any recombination, the total lysogenic activity would be the sum of their individual activities minus their overlap. So the expected lysed proportion would be q + r - qr, where q is the lysogenic activity of the first phage, r is the lysogenic activity of the second, and qr is the overlapping activity.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the lysogenic phage alone causes half the colonies to be lysed. That implies that when only one lysogenic phage is present, the lysed fraction is 50%. If we add another phage, the lysed fraction drops to 40%, as observed. So the change from 50% to 40% indicates that the addition of the second phage reduces the lysed fraction by 10%.\n\nThis suggests that the second phage's activity is reducing the lysed fraction. If the two phages were independent, the expected lysed fraction would be q + r - qr. If q = 0.5 (since 50% lysed), then substituting:\n\nExpected lysed = 0.5 + r - 0.5r = 0.5 + 0.5r.\n\nWe observe 0.4, so:\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = -0.1 \u2192 r = -0.2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because r is a percentage between 0 and 1, and negative values don't make sense here. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation should reflect that the lysed fraction decreases due to interference.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of successful infections when two phages interfere is given by:\n\nP = P1 + P2 - P1*P2,\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each phage attacking a cell. Here, P1 is the lysogenic activity of the first phage, and P2 is the lysogenic activity of the second phage. If both are acting independently, the total probability is as above. \n\nGiven that with only P1, P = 0.5 (50% lysed), and with both, P = 0.4 (40%). Plugging in:\n\n0.4 = P1 + P2 - P1*P2.\n\nSince P1 = 0.5 (from the first observation):\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + P2 - 0.5*P2 \u2192 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2 \u2192 0.5P2 = -0.1 \u2192 P2 = -0.2.\n\nAgain, a negative value doesn't make sense. Perhaps this indicates that the two phages interfere constructively instead of destructively? Or maybe my assumption about the equation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula when two phages interfere is P = P1 + P2 - P1*P2, but if the second phage's activity is such that it reduces the lysed fraction, then the equation still holds, but P2 might be negative, which isn't possible. Therefore, this suggests that the two phages interfere constructively, and the lysed fraction increases beyond what would be expected from simple addition. However, in our case, the lysed fraction decreased, indicating interference.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the possibility of recombination. Recombination would mean that the two phages exchange genetic material, changing their fitnesses. If they recombine, the overall effect on the lysed fraction would depend on their individual contributions. Let's say that the first phage has a lysogenic activity of q, and the second has a lysogenic activity of r, and they recombine with a fraction f. Then, the expected lysed fraction would be q*(1-f) + r*f - q*r*f. Wait, no, that seems off. Alternatively, if they recombine, the effective lysogenic activity would be (q + r)/2, assuming complete recombination. \n\nSo, without recombination, the lysed fraction is q + r - q*r. With recombination, it becomes (q + r)/2. If that's the case, then without recombination, the lysed fraction is 0.5 + r - 0.5r = 0.5 + 0.5r. With recombination, it becomes (0.5 + r)/2 = 0.25 + 0.5r.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nWithout recombination, lysed fraction = 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = 0 \u2192 r = 0. So no recombination.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction = 0.4 = 0.25 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = 0.15 \u2192 r = 0.3.\n\nThus, recombination occurs with a fraction of 0.3, meaning 30% of the time. Wait, but the options don't include 30%. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Hmm, 0.3% is 0.003, which is close to 0.3, but I'm getting 0.3, which is 0.003 as a fraction. Wait, no, the problem asks for the recombination amount, probably expressed as a percentage. So 0.3 corresponds to 0.3%, which is option F. But wait, earlier calculations gave r=0.3, which is 0.3, meaning 0.3% recombination. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, let's recast:\n\nIf without recombination, lysed fraction is 0.5.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction is 0.4.\n\nAssuming recombination fraction f, then the lysed fraction becomes:\n\n( q + r ) / 2.\n\nBecause when they recombine, the effective lysogenic activity is the average of the two. So, q + r = 2 * (effective lysogenic).\n\nThus, without recombination, lysed fraction = q + r - q*r.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction = (q + r)/2.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n(q + r) - q*r = 0.5\n\n(q + r)/2 = 0.4 \u2192 q + r = 0.8\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n0.8 - (q + r)*r = 0.5 \u2192 0.8 - 0.8*r = 0.5 \u2192 0.8*r = 0.3 \u2192 r = 0.375.\n\nThen, q = 0.8 - r = 0.425.\n\nNow, the recombination fraction is f = (q + r)/(q + r) = 1, which can't be right. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps f = (q + r)/(q + r) = 1, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the recombination fraction as f, which is the fraction of cases where the two phages have recombined. Thus, when f=1, all combinations have recombined; when f=0, none have.\n\nIn that case, the expected lysed fraction would be:\n\n(q + r)*(1 - f) - q*r*f.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should use the standard formula for interference. Interference occurs when two events occur in such a way that their occurrence is negatively correlated. In the context of phages, this would mean that the second phage's attack reduces the lysed fraction. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (number of double hits) / (expected number of double hits without interference).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here directly.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of double hits (cells lysed by both phages) would be P1*P2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where they recombined. Without interference, f=0, so expected double hits = P1*P2.\n\nWith interference, f > 0, so expected double hits = P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nIn our case, without interference, the lysed fraction is 0.5, which equals P1 + P2 - P1*P2 = 0.5.\n\nWith interference, the lysed fraction is 0.4, which equals P1 + P2 - P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nWe already know P1 = 0.5.\n\nSo, 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5*P2 - 0.5*P2*(1 - f).\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2 - 0.5P2 + 0.5P2f \u2192 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2f.\n\nRearranging:\n\n0.5P2f = 0.4 - 0.5 \u2192 0.5P2f = -0.1 \u2192 P2f = -0.2.\n\nBut P2 is the lysogenic activity of the second phage, which can't be negative. So this suggests that either my approach is flawed or I've misunderstood the relationship.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the frequencies of the two mutations and determine how often they recombine.\n\nEach mutation in the T_4 genome contributes to the formation of recombinant phages. The total number of possible combinations is N = n1*n2, where n1 and n2 are the numbers of each mutation. The actual number of recombinants is n1*n2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of crossover events.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage alone has a certain frequency of lysogenic activity, say L. When combined with another phage, the frequency of double lysogeny (both phages active) is L1*L2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of times they recombine.\n\nFrom the experiment, when only L1 is present, the lysed fraction is 0.5, which suggests that L1 = 0.5 (50% lysogenic activity). When both L1 and L2 are present, the lysed fraction is 0.4. Assuming that L2 is another mutation, let\u2019s denote its frequency as L2 = x.\n\nThe expected lysed fraction when both L1 and L2 are present would be L1 + L2 - L1*L2 = 0.5 + x - 0.5x = 0.5 + 0.5x.\n\nBut the observed lysed fraction is 0.4, so:\n\n0.5 + 0.5x = 0.4 \u2192 0.5x = -0.1 \u2192 x = -0.2.\n\nNegative frequency doesn't make sense, so perhaps my assumptions are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the two mutations are acting independently but in a constructive interference manner, the lysed fraction could decrease further. But without knowing the exact relationship, this is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at the ratio of the lysed fractions. With only L1, lysed fraction is 0.5. With both L1 and L2, it's 0.4. The ratio is 0.4/0.5 = 0.8, which suggests that the presence of L2 reduces the lysed fraction by 20%. If the two mutations are independent, the expected reduction would depend on their individual frequencies.\n\nSuppose that the frequency of L2 is y. Then, the expected lysed fraction would be 0.5 + y - 0.5y = 0.5 + 0.5y. Setting this equal to 0.4 gives y = -0.2, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the mutations interfere constructively, and the lysed fraction increases beyond the expected value, but in reality, the observed lysed fraction is lower than expected, which contradicts this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations are not interfering but are simply having a synergistic effect. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage alone causes half the cells to be lysed, and the presence of both causes less. So the combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects, indicating some form of interference.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interference. The coefficient of coincidence (COI) is given by:\n\nCOI = (Observed double hits) / (Expected double hits without interference).\n\nThe expected double hits without interference would be P1*P2, where P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. The observed double hits would be P1*P2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where the mutations are recombined.\n\nIn our case, P1 = 0.5, P2 is unknown. The observed lysed fraction is 0.4, which includes both single hits and double hits. So:\n\n0.4 = P1 + P2 - P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nWe also know that P1*P2 = expected double hits without interference.\n\nBut without more information, this is difficult to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can estimate the fraction of cases where the two mutations are recombined. Since when only L1 is present, the lysed fraction is 0.5, and with both L1 and L2, it's 0.4, perhaps the difference in lysed fraction can help determine the recombination fraction.\n\nThe difference in lysed fraction is 0.1 (0.5 to 0.4). This may relate to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let's assume that the frequency of L2 is y, then the expected lysed fraction would be 0.5 + y - 0.5y = 0.5 + 0.5y. Setting this equal to 0.4 gives y = -0.2, which is impossible. So perhaps the mutations are working synergistically, meaning that the expected lysed fraction is higher than what would be expected from independent events. But in our case, the lysed fraction is lower, so perhaps they are working against each other, creating a synergistic repression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of cases where both mutations are present is (1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where they recombine. If f is small, then most cases have the mutations in different forms, but if f is large, they are recombining often.\n\nWait, let me try another angle. The observed lysed fraction is 0.4 when both mutations are present. The expected lysed fraction when only L1 is present is 0.5. The difference is 0.1, which might correspond to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. So:\n\nL1 * L2 = 0.1.\n\nBut L1 is 0.5, so L2 = 0.2.\n\nTherefore, the recombination fraction f is (L1 + L2)/(L1 + L2) = 1, which doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps f = (L1 + L2)/(L1 + L2) = 1, which is not useful.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nInterference = 1 - (observed double hits)/(expected double hits).\n\nBut without knowing the expected double hits, this is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the product of the two mutation frequencies. If L1 is 0.5 and L2 is 0.2, then recombination frequency f = 0.5*0.2 = 0.1, which is 10%. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the closest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). My rough calculation suggests around 10%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of double hits (double lysogeny) when both mutations are present is L1*L2*(1 -",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first condition, only lysogenic phages are used, leading to half the colonies being lysed. Then another half is treated with both mutated phages. However, the results show that 40% of the B lawn and 4% of the K lawn are positive. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the steps again. The main process is that when two different phage mutants are mixed, their effect depends on whether they interact or recombine. If they don't recombine, the effects might be additive or independent. If they do recombine, the overall effect could be either synergistic (both beneficial) or antagonistic (one bad, the other good). \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage alone leads to half of the E. coli being lysed. When both are present, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, which is less than half, suggesting that the presence of the lysogenic phage inhibits its own activity. This makes sense because lysogenic phages typically cause lysing rather than lysogeny. So adding another type of phage should reduce the number of lysed cells. Now, looking at the second part: half the B lawn is treated with both mutated phages, and half with K. The K lawn has 4 plumes, while the B lawn has 40. Wait, no, perhaps I got the halves wrong. Let me try again. The main plate is split into two equal parts: one part is treated with both mutant phages (so both mutations are present), and the other part is treated with K. Each part is then diluted differently before plating onto strain B and K respectively. On the B side, 4 plumes appear, and on the K side, 40 plumes appear. Since the initial plate was split into two, each with a certain dilution factor, the probabilities would depend on those dilutions. \n\nLet me model this. Suppose the probability of a phage attacking the E. coli is p. For the lysogenic phage alone, the probability of causing lytic fission (and thus lysing the cell) is q. When both phages are present, the combined probability of attack is p1 + p2 - p1*p2, assuming independence. However, if they recombine, the effective probability becomes p * (q + r - q*r), where r is the recombination fraction. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently.\n\nThe experiment measures the frequency of successful infections. When only lysogenic is present, half the colonies are lysed, meaning the lysogenic phage must have a high success rate. When both phages are present, the B lawn shows 40 plumes, which is 40% of the colony count, implying that the lysogenic phage's effect is reduced. Similarly, on the K lawn, 4 plumes out of 100,000 colonies, which is much lower. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is significantly reducing its own effectiveness when another phage is present. \n\nNow, considering the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If the two phages act independently without any recombination, the total lysogenic activity would be the sum of their individual activities minus their overlap. So the expected lysed proportion would be q + r - qr, where q is the lysogenic activity of the first phage, r is the lysogenic activity of the second, and qr is the overlapping activity.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the lysogenic phage alone causes half the colonies to be lysed. That implies that when only one lysogenic phage is present, the lysed fraction is 50%. If we add another phage, the lysed fraction drops to 40%, as observed. So the change from 50% to 40% indicates that the addition of the second phage reduces the lysed fraction by 10%.\n\nThis suggests that the second phage's activity is reducing the lysed fraction. If the two phages were independent, the expected lysed fraction would be q + r - qr. If q = 0.5 (since 50% lysed), then substituting:\n\nExpected lysed = 0.5 + r - 0.5r = 0.5 + 0.5r.\n\nWe observe 0.4, so:\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = -0.1 \u2192 r = -0.2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because r is a percentage between 0 and 1, and negative values don't make sense here. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation should reflect that the lysed fraction decreases due to interference.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of successful infections when two phages interfere is given by:\n\nP = P1 + P2 - P1*P2,\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each phage attacking a cell. Here, P1 is the lysogenic activity of the first phage, and P2 is the lysogenic activity of the second phage. If both are acting independently, the total probability is as above. \n\nGiven that with only P1, P = 0.5 (50% lysed), and with both, P = 0.4 (40%). Plugging in:\n\n0.4 = P1 + P2 - P1*P2.\n\nSince P1 = 0.5 (from the first observation):\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + P2 - 0.5*P2 \u2192 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2 \u2192 0.5P2 = -0.1 \u2192 P2 = -0.2.\n\nAgain, a negative value doesn't make sense. Perhaps this indicates that the two phages interfere constructively instead of destructively? Or maybe my assumption about the equation is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula when two phages interfere is P = P1 + P2 - P1*P2, but if the second phage's activity is such that it reduces the lysed fraction, then the equation still holds, but P2 might be negative, which isn't possible. Therefore, this suggests that the two phages interfere constructively, and the lysed fraction increases beyond what would be expected from simple addition. However, in our case, the lysed fraction decreased, indicating interference.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the possibility of recombination. Recombination would mean that the two phages exchange genetic material, changing their fitnesses. If they recombine, the overall effect on the lysed fraction would depend on their individual contributions. Let's say that the first phage has a lysogenic activity of q, and the second has a lysogenic activity of r, and they recombine with a fraction f. Then, the expected lysed fraction would be q*(1-f) + r*f - q*r*f. Wait, no, that seems off. Alternatively, if they recombine, the effective lysogenic activity would be (q + r)/2, assuming complete recombination. \n\nSo, without recombination, the lysed fraction is q + r - q*r. With recombination, it becomes (q + r)/2. If that's the case, then without recombination, the lysed fraction is 0.5 + r - 0.5r = 0.5 + 0.5r. With recombination, it becomes (0.5 + r)/2 = 0.25 + 0.5r.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nWithout recombination, lysed fraction = 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = 0 \u2192 r = 0. So no recombination.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction = 0.4 = 0.25 + 0.5r \u2192 0.5r = 0.15 \u2192 r = 0.3.\n\nThus, recombination occurs with a fraction of 0.3, meaning 30% of the time. Wait, but the options don't include 30%. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Hmm, 0.3% is 0.003, which is close to 0.3, but I'm getting 0.3, which is 0.003 as a fraction. Wait, no, the problem asks for the recombination amount, probably expressed as a percentage. So 0.3 corresponds to 0.3%, which is option F. But wait, earlier calculations gave r=0.3, which is 0.3, meaning 0.3% recombination. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, let's recast:\n\nIf without recombination, lysed fraction is 0.5.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction is 0.4.\n\nAssuming recombination fraction f, then the lysed fraction becomes:\n\n( q + r ) / 2.\n\nBecause when they recombine, the effective lysogenic activity is the average of the two. So, q + r = 2 * (effective lysogenic).\n\nThus, without recombination, lysed fraction = q + r - q*r.\n\nWith recombination, lysed fraction = (q + r)/2.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n(q + r) - q*r = 0.5\n\n(q + r)/2 = 0.4 \u2192 q + r = 0.8\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n0.8 - (q + r)*r = 0.5 \u2192 0.8 - 0.8*r = 0.5 \u2192 0.8*r = 0.3 \u2192 r = 0.375.\n\nThen, q = 0.8 - r = 0.425.\n\nNow, the recombination fraction is f = (q + r)/(q + r) = 1, which can't be right. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps f = (q + r)/(q + r) = 1, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the recombination fraction as f, which is the fraction of cases where the two phages have recombined. Thus, when f=1, all combinations have recombined; when f=0, none have.\n\nIn that case, the expected lysed fraction would be:\n\n(q + r)*(1 - f) - q*r*f.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should use the standard formula for interference. Interference occurs when two events occur in such a way that their occurrence is negatively correlated. In the context of phages, this would mean that the second phage's attack reduces the lysed fraction. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (number of double hits) / (expected number of double hits without interference).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here directly.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of double hits (cells lysed by both phages) would be P1*P2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where they recombined. Without interference, f=0, so expected double hits = P1*P2.\n\nWith interference, f > 0, so expected double hits = P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nIn our case, without interference, the lysed fraction is 0.5, which equals P1 + P2 - P1*P2 = 0.5.\n\nWith interference, the lysed fraction is 0.4, which equals P1 + P2 - P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nWe already know P1 = 0.5.\n\nSo, 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5*P2 - 0.5*P2*(1 - f).\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2 - 0.5P2 + 0.5P2f \u2192 0.4 = 0.5 + 0.5P2f.\n\nRearranging:\n\n0.5P2f = 0.4 - 0.5 \u2192 0.5P2f = -0.1 \u2192 P2f = -0.2.\n\nBut P2 is the lysogenic activity of the second phage, which can't be negative. So this suggests that either my approach is flawed or I've misunderstood the relationship.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the frequencies of the two mutations and determine how often they recombine.\n\nEach mutation in the T_4 genome contributes to the formation of recombinant phages. The total number of possible combinations is N = n1*n2, where n1 and n2 are the numbers of each mutation. The actual number of recombinants is n1*n2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of crossover events.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage alone has a certain frequency of lysogenic activity, say L. When combined with another phage, the frequency of double lysogeny (both phages active) is L1*L2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of times they recombine.\n\nFrom the experiment, when only L1 is present, the lysed fraction is 0.5, which suggests that L1 = 0.5 (50% lysogenic activity). When both L1 and L2 are present, the lysed fraction is 0.4. Assuming that L2 is another mutation, let\u2019s denote its frequency as L2 = x.\n\nThe expected lysed fraction when both L1 and L2 are present would be L1 + L2 - L1*L2 = 0.5 + x - 0.5x = 0.5 + 0.5x.\n\nBut the observed lysed fraction is 0.4, so:\n\n0.5 + 0.5x = 0.4 \u2192 0.5x = -0.1 \u2192 x = -0.2.\n\nNegative frequency doesn't make sense, so perhaps my assumptions are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the two mutations are acting independently but in a constructive interference manner, the lysed fraction could decrease further. But without knowing the exact relationship, this is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should look at the ratio of the lysed fractions. With only L1, lysed fraction is 0.5. With both L1 and L2, it's 0.4. The ratio is 0.4/0.5 = 0.8, which suggests that the presence of L2 reduces the lysed fraction by 20%. If the two mutations are independent, the expected reduction would depend on their individual frequencies.\n\nSuppose that the frequency of L2 is y. Then, the expected lysed fraction would be 0.5 + y - 0.5y = 0.5 + 0.5y. Setting this equal to 0.4 gives y = -0.2, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the mutations interfere constructively, and the lysed fraction increases beyond the expected value, but in reality, the observed lysed fraction is lower than expected, which contradicts this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations are not interfering but are simply having a synergistic effect. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage alone causes half the cells to be lysed, and the presence of both causes less. So the combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects, indicating some form of interference.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for interference. The coefficient of coincidence (COI) is given by:\n\nCOI = (Observed double hits) / (Expected double hits without interference).\n\nThe expected double hits without interference would be P1*P2, where P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring. The observed double hits would be P1*P2*(1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where the mutations are recombined.\n\nIn our case, P1 = 0.5, P2 is unknown. The observed lysed fraction is 0.4, which includes both single hits and double hits. So:\n\n0.4 = P1 + P2 - P1*P2*(1 - f).\n\nWe also know that P1*P2 = expected double hits without interference.\n\nBut without more information, this is difficult to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can estimate the fraction of cases where the two mutations are recombined. Since when only L1 is present, the lysed fraction is 0.5, and with both L1 and L2, it's 0.4, perhaps the difference in lysed fraction can help determine the recombination fraction.\n\nThe difference in lysed fraction is 0.1 (0.5 to 0.4). This may relate to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let's assume that the frequency of L2 is y, then the expected lysed fraction would be 0.5 + y - 0.5y = 0.5 + 0.5y. Setting this equal to 0.4 gives y = -0.2, which is impossible. So perhaps the mutations are working synergistically, meaning that the expected lysed fraction is higher than what would be expected from independent events. But in our case, the lysed fraction is lower, so perhaps they are working against each other, creating a synergistic repression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction of cases where both mutations are present is (1 - f), where f is the fraction of cases where they recombine. If f is small, then most cases have the mutations in different forms, but if f is large, they are recombining often.\n\nWait, let me try another angle. The observed lysed fraction is 0.4 when both mutations are present. The expected lysed fraction when only L1 is present is 0.5. The difference is 0.1, which might correspond to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. So:\n\nL1 * L2 = 0.1.\n\nBut L1 is 0.5, so L2 = 0.2.\n\nTherefore, the recombination fraction f is (L1 + L2)/(L1 + L2) = 1, which doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps f = (L1 + L2)/(L1 + L2) = 1, which is not useful.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interference:\n\nInterference = 1 - (observed double hits)/(expected double hits).\n\nBut without knowing the expected double hits, this is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is the product of the two mutation frequencies. If L1 is 0.5 and L2 is 0.2, then recombination frequency f = 0.5*0.2 = 0.1, which is 10%. But this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the closest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). My rough calculation suggests around 10%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of double hits (double lysogeny) when both mutations are present is L1*L2*(1 -",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

In experiments like this, the number of recombinant phages (those that carry both mutations) would be important because they could cause more severe effects when combined. The recombination frequency refers to the likelihood that a recombination event has occurred between the two mutations. Since the question asks for the amount of recombination, which is typically measured as a percentage. The options given are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 5%, and even up to 5%. \n\nNow, looking at the results: when both mutation types are present, the outcome is different than either alone. This indicates some interaction. The specific numbers here might relate to the expected number of recombinants. Normally, without any recombination, the probability of getting a certain number of recombinant phages would follow a binomial distribution. The expected number of recombinants would depend on the allele frequencies and the probability of recombination. However, in this case, we're observing that on strain K, only 4 plumes are found, whereas on strain B, 40 are found. That seems quite low compared to the expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage reduces the susceptibility of the lysogenic phage by causing it to lyse the host, thus making it less effective. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell; it just integrates into the chromosome. If both types are present, maybe the lysogenic phage takes over and starts causing lysis, leading to more susceptible cells. Alternatively, the lytic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, reducing its growth. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nThe formula for calculating the recombination frequency is often based on the ratio of observed recombinants to the total possible. It's usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if you expect a certain number of recombinants based on allele frequencies, and the actual number deviates significantly, that deviation indicates recombination. The classic problem in genetics where two loci are linked and a recessive mutation at one locus affects the phenotype at the other locus due to crossing over is used here. The recombination frequency can be calculated using the chi-square test or the Hardy-Weinberg equation.\n\nIn this scenario, the high dilution (1:1e5) probably means that the chance of having two mutations (the lysogenic and the lytic) combining is low. However, the fact that only 4 plumes appeared on K suggests that the combination didn't happen frequently enough. Wait, actually, when both mutation types are present, the effect depends on whether they are independent or recombining. If they are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. If they recombine, then the probability is adjusted.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider the expected number of recombinants. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of recombinants would be the sum of the products of the allele frequencies for each mutation type. However, since the exact allele frequencies aren't given, I'll assume they are equal. Let's say each mutation occurs at a frequency of p and q, respectively. Then, the expected number of recombinants would be 2pq, assuming they are completely independent. But wait, in reality, the presence of one mutation may affect the occurrence of the other. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution factor (1:1e5) means that only a small fraction of the cells are plated. Therefore, the chance of any individual phage causing an infection is low. If both mutation types are present, the presence of one might influence the presence of the other. For instance, if a phage carrying one mutation also carries the other, it could lead to a higher chance of both mutations being present in a single cell, thus affecting the host more severely. But in the experiment, the result was that when both types were present, strain B was mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage caused the damage, possibly taking over and killing the lysogenic ones. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, making it less likely to grow, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the results: when both mutation types are present, only 4 plumes appear on K. On B, 40 are found. That suggests that when both are present, the lysogenic phage (which is responsible for lysing the lysogenic phage) is more prevalent on B, leading to more infections on B, hence more plumes on B. On K, since only the lysogenic phage is present, but the lytic phage is absent (because it's the other strain), the lysogenic phage can infect K cells normally, resulting in fewer plumes on K. Wait, no\u2014K is another strain. If the lysogenic phage is present, it should infect all strains, including K. So why is the count on K only 4?\n\nAh, perhaps because the lysogenic phage is not present on K, or vice versa? No, both strains have lysogenic phages. Wait, the lysogenic phage is the same across both strains, so when both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages would cause more damage on both strains. But according to the results, on K, only 4 plumes were found, while on B, 40 were found. That suggests that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage is more common on B, leading to more infections, hence more plumes on B, and less on K because the lysogenic phage isn't present or is less abundant on K.\n\nThis implies that the presence of lysogenic phage enhances the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate within the host cell. By doing so, it increases the chance of lysogeny spreading, leading to more infections on B. Conversely, on K, since lysogenic phages are present, but maybe the lysogenic phage is not efficiently replicating, or perhaps the lytic phage is more effective at causing lysis, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to infect the host. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage on K is less effective at integrating into the host genome, leading to fewer infections.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that the presence of both mutation types leads to more damage on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more effective or that it's more likely to cause damage. This could indicate that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that makes it more efficient at replicating or causing lysis, thereby increasing the chance of lysogeny spreading. Alternatively, it could be that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause damage when it replicates inside the host cell, leading to more lysogenic phage particles forming.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination would occur if the lysogenic phage and the lytic phage exchange genetic material, creating recombinant phages that carry both mutations. The presence of such recombinant phages would increase the chances of interactions, leading to more severe effects when both types are present.\n\nGiven the experimental results, the only way to determine the recombination frequency is to calculate how many times the lysogenic and lytic phages combined, i.e., produced recombinant phages. The number of recombinant phages would be proportional to the square of the recombination frequency (if assuming random segregation).\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of recombinants would be 2rN, where N is the total number of phages. However, since the exact values are not provided, we can infer based on the results. The high dilution (1:1e5) suggests that the chance of any individual phage causing an infection is low. Therefore, the presence of multiple recombinants would require that both mutation types are present together, leading to increased recombination events.\n\nLooking at the results again, when both mutation types are present, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had only 4. This suggests that the presence of both mutations caused more infections on B, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on B. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be such that it allows for more infections on B, meaning that the mutation combinations led to higher rates of lysogeny.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is very low, the chance of both mutations combining is low, but if it's high, it increases the risk of both mutations being present in the same cell, leading to more plasmid replication and potential for more infections. Given that the results showed more infections on B when both mutations were present, this suggests that the recombination frequency is relatively high, allowing for more frequent occurrence of the lysogenic phage in the host cells, thereby increasing the chance of lysogeny spread.\n\nBut to find the exact value, we'd need to use the chi-square test comparing observed vs expected recombinants. However, without knowing the expected number, we can make an educated guess. The observed data suggest that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is more common on B, leading to more infections on B and fewer on K. This could imply that the recombination frequency is around 20%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAnother angle is that the presence of both mutations in the same host cell increases the likelihood of recombination, which would lead to more plasmid copies. If the recombination frequency is 1%, then only 1% of the phages would carry both mutations, leading to more recombinants. But the observed counts don't support that\u2014they show a much larger number of recombinants.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the presence of both mutations leading to more lysogeny is incorrect. Instead, the presence of the lysogenic phage might reduce the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate, leading to a higher concentration of lysogenic phages in B, thus causing more plasmid replication and more lysogeny spread. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is not present on K, then the lysogenic phage on B might dominate, causing more infections on B.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main takeaway is that the presence of both mutations leads to more damage on B, suggesting that the recombination frequency is high enough to allow both mutations to be present in the same cell. Looking at the answer choices, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. Since the results show a noticeable increase in plumes on B, this suggests a moderate level of recombination. Between D and F, 0.3% seems plausible, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, the correct answer might be C (1.5%) based on standard textbook examples where recombination frequencies are reported as medium to high percentages. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to say exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Maybe another approach is better.\n\nThe formula for calculating the recombination frequency is often based on the ratio of observed recombinants to the total possible. It's usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if you expect a certain number of recombinants based on allele frequencies, and the actual number deviates significantly, that deviation indicates recombination. The classic problem in genetics where two loci are linked and a recessive mutation at one locus affects the phenotype at the other locus due to crossing over is used here. The recombination frequency can be calculated using the chi-square test or the Hardy-Weinberg equation.\n\nIn this scenario, the high dilution (1:1e5) probably means that the chance of having two mutations (the lysogenic and the lytic) combining is low. However, the fact that only 4 plumes appeared on K suggests that the combination didn't happen frequently enough. Wait, actually, when both mutation types are present, the effect depends on whether they are independent or recombining. If they are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. If they recombine, then the probability is adjusted.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider the expected number of recombinants. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of recombinants would be the sum of the products of the allele frequencies for each mutation type. However, since the exact allele frequencies aren't given, I'll assume they are equal. Let's say each mutation occurs at a frequency of p and q, respectively. Then, the expected number of recombinants would be 2pq, assuming they are completely independent. But wait, in reality, the presence of one mutation may affect the occurrence of the other. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution factor (1:1e5) means that only a small fraction of the cells are plated. Therefore, the chance of any individual phage causing an infection is low. If both mutation types are present, the presence of one might influence the presence of the other. For instance, if a phage carrying one mutation also carries the other, it could lead to a higher chance of both mutations being present in a single cell, thus affecting the host more severely. But in the experiment, the result was that when both types were present, strain B was mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage caused the damage, possibly taking over and killing the lysogenic ones. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might lyse the lysogenic phage, making it less likely to grow, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the results: when both mutation types are present, only 4 plumes appear on K. On B, 40 are found. That suggests that when both are present, the lysogenic phage (which is responsible for lysing the lysogenic phage) is more prevalent on B, leading to more infections on B, hence more plumes on B. On K, since only the lysogenic phage is present, but the lytic phage is absent (because it's the other strain), the lysogenic phage can infect K cells normally, resulting in fewer plumes on K. Wait, no\u2014K is another strain. If the lysogenic phage is present, it should infect all strains, including K. So why is the count on K only 4?\n\nAh, perhaps because the lysogenic phage is not present on K, or vice versa? No, both strains have lysogenic phages. Wait, the lysogenic phage is the same across both strains, so when both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages would cause more damage on both strains. But according to the results, on K, only 4 plumes were found, while on B, 40 were found. That suggests that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage is more common on B, leading to more infections, hence more plumes on B, and less on K because the lysogenic phage isn't present or is less abundant on K.\n\nThis implies that the presence of lysogenic phage enhances the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate within the host cell. By doing so, it increases the chance of lysogeny spreading, leading to more infections on B. Conversely, on K, since lysogenic phages are present, but maybe the lysogenic phage is not efficiently replicating, or perhaps the lytic phage is more effective at causing lysis, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to infect the host. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage on K is less effective at integrating into the host genome, leading to fewer infections.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that the presence of both mutation types leads to more damage on B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is more effective or that it's more likely to cause damage. This could indicate that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that makes it more efficient at replicating or causing lysis, thereby increasing the chance of lysogeny spreading. Alternatively, it could be that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause damage when it replicates inside the host cell, leading to more lysogenic phage particles forming.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination would occur if the lysogenic phage and the lytic phage exchange genetic material, creating recombinant phages that carry both mutations. The presence of such recombinant phages would increase the chances of interactions, leading to more severe effects when both types are present.\n\nGiven the experimental results, the only way to determine the recombination frequency is to calculate how many times the lysogenic and lytic phages combined, i.e., produced recombinant phages. The number of recombinant phages would be proportional to the square of the recombination frequency (if assuming random segregation).\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency is r, then the expected number of recombinants would be 2rN, where N is the total number of phages. However, since the exact values are not provided, we can infer based on the results. The high dilution (1:1e5) suggests that the chance of any individual phage causing an infection is low. Therefore, the presence of multiple recombinants would require that both mutation types are present together, leading to increased recombination events.\n\nLooking at the results again, when both mutation types are present, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had only 4. This suggests that the presence of both mutations caused more infections on B, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on B. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be such that it allows for more infections on B, meaning that the mutation combinations led to higher rates of lysogeny.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is very low, the chance of both mutations combining is low, but if it's high, it increases the risk of both mutations being present in the same cell, leading to more plasmid replication and potential for more infections. Given that the results showed more infections on B when both mutations were present, this suggests that the recombination frequency is relatively high, allowing for more frequent occurrence of the lysogenic phage in the host cells, thereby increasing the chance of lysogeny spread.\n\nBut to find the exact value, we'd need to use the chi-square test comparing observed vs expected recombinants. However, without knowing the expected number, we can make an educated guess. The observed data suggest that when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage is more common on B, leading to more infections on B and fewer on K. This could imply that the recombination frequency is around 20%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAnother angle is that the presence of both mutations in the same host cell increases the likelihood of recombination, which would lead to more plasmid copies. If the recombination frequency is 1%, then only 1% of the phages would carry both mutations, leading to more recombinants. But the observed counts don't support that\u2014they show a much larger number of recombinants.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the presence of both mutations leading to more lysogeny is incorrect. Instead, the presence of the lysogenic phage might reduce the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate, leading to a higher concentration of lysogenic phages in B, thus causing more plasmid replication and more lysogeny spread. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is not present on K, then the lysogenic phage on B might dominate, causing more infections on B.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating this. The main takeaway is that the presence of both mutations leads to more damage on B, suggesting that the recombination frequency is high enough to allow both mutations to be present in the same cell. Looking at the answer choices, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. Since the results show a noticeable increase in plumes on B, this suggests a moderate level of recombination. Between D and F, 0.3% seems plausible, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, the correct answer might be C (1.5%) based on standard textbook examples where recombination frequencies are reported as medium to high percentages. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to say exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The number of plumes observed depends on the likelihood of successful combination. In the first scenario, only lysogenic phages infect strain B, leading to its death. When both types are present, strain B is mostly dead, suggesting that some of the lysogenic phages are combining with the existing wild-type phages (since the lysogenic ones don't cause death). Alternatively, the presence of both types might lead to a different outcome depending on their interaction. However, the main point is that when both mutations are present, some of the phages could be causing issues, possibly through recombination. \n\nIn population genetics terms, the expected recombinant frequency would relate to the observed number of recombined events. The formula for expected recombination frequency is approximately 2p(1-p), where p is the frequency of one mutation. However, in this context, we're dealing with a specific ratio from the experiment. Let's consider the dilution factors and the number of plumes. For strain B, the first sample was diluted 1:1e7, meaning each well had 1e-7 cells. Plated on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes appeared. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes appeared when the other sample was diluted 1:1e5. \n\nWait, the second part says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So if the original samples were split, then each group has a certain dilution. The first group (diluted 1e7) is tested on strain B, and the second (diluted 1e5) is tested on strain K. The number of plumes indicates the density of infection. Since the lysogenic phages die, any positive results must be due to recombination creating a dominant phage type that infects more effectively. \n\nIf the lysogenic phages are recombining with wild-type phages, this could create a new dominant phage that infects more, thus reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, if it's creating a strong phage that doesn't die, it might increase plumes. But in this case, the lysogenic phages are causing death, so recombination likely leads to a stronger phage that can infect more. \n\nNow, considering the dilution factors, the first sample (diluted 1e7) shows 40 plumes, while the second (diluted 1e5) shows 4. This suggests that at a higher dilution (1e7), the phages are less concentrated, so fewer plumes (40 vs. 4). At a lower dilution (1e5), concentrations are higher, so more plumes (4 vs. 40). The ratio of plumes should reflect the product of the dilution factors. \n\nThe ratio of plumes from the two groups is 40/4 = 10. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, whose ratio is 1e2 (since 1e7 / 1e5 = 1e2). The observed ratio matches the expected ratio from dilution. So, the expected recombinant frequency can be calculated as follows: the expected ratio is equal to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If p is the frequency of one mutation, then the expected ratio is 2p(1-p). Assuming p is small (which it probably is given the options provided), 2p \u2248 10. So p \u2248 5%. Wait, but none of the options go up to 5%. The closest is option C (1.5%) and D (0.1%). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nAlternatively, the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two alleles. If the frequency of one mutation is x, the other is y, then the expected number of recombinants is 2xy/(x+y). But without knowing the exact frequencies, perhaps another approach is needed. Given that the ratio of plumes is 10, and the dilution factors' ratio is also 10, it suggests that the frequency of each mutation is such that their product equals the ratio. So if the frequency of one mutation is 0.05 (5%), then the other would be 0.2 (20%), but that seems too high. Alternatively, if the frequency of each is 0.02 (2%), then 2*0.02*0.98 \u2248 0.0392, which isn't matching. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nLooking back, the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes corresponds to the frequency of successful combinations. The expected recombinant frequency is often estimated using the ratio of plumes. Here, the ratio of plumes (strain B sample to strain K sample) is 40/4=10. The dilution factors' ratio is (1e7)/(1e5)=1e2=100. The actual ratio observed is 10, which is much smaller than 100. This discrepancy suggests that not all possible recombinations occurred successfully. \n\nGiven that the observed ratio is 10 and the theoretical maximum under complete recombination would be 100, the actual frequency is 10/100=10%. But the answer choices don't include 10%, so perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the square root of the dilution factor ratio. If we take the square root of 100 (the ratio of dilutions), which is 10, then 1/10=0.1% (option D). That makes sense because the square root relates to the geometric mean of the dilutions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but in the mixed case, some of the phages might be causing issues, perhaps due to recombination leading to a dominant phage type. \n\nThe key here is determining the frequency of recombination. The number of plumes observed depends on the likelihood of successful combination. In the first scenario, only lysogenic phages infect strain B, leading to its death. When both types are present, strain B is mostly dead, suggesting that some of the lysogenic phages are combining with the existing wild-type phages (since the lysogenic ones don't cause death). Alternatively, the presence of both types might lead to a different outcome depending on their interaction. However, the main point is that when both mutations are present, some of the phages could be causing issues, possibly through recombination. \n\nIn population genetics terms, the expected recombinant frequency would relate to the observed number of recombined events. The formula for expected recombination frequency is approximately 2p(1-p), where p is the frequency of one mutation. However, in this context, we're dealing with a specific ratio from the experiment. Let's consider the dilution factors and the number of plumes. For strain B, the first sample was diluted 1:1e7, meaning each well had 1e-7 cells. Plated on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes appeared. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes appeared when the other sample was diluted 1:1e5. \n\nWait, the second part says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So if the original samples were split, then each group has a certain dilution. The first group (diluted 1e7) is tested on strain B, and the second (diluted 1e5) is tested on strain K. The number of plumes indicates the density of infection. Since the lysogenic phages die, any positive results must be due to recombination creating a dominant phage type that infects more effectively. \n\nIf the lysogenic phages are recombining with wild-type phages, this could create a new dominant phage that infects more, thus reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, if it's creating a strong phage that doesn't die, it might increase plumes. But in this case, the lysogenic phages are causing death, so recombination likely leads to a stronger phage that can infect more. \n\nNow, considering the dilution factors, the first sample (diluted 1e7) shows 40 plumes, while the second (diluted 1e5) shows 4. This suggests that at a higher dilution (1e7), the phages are less concentrated, so fewer plumes (40 vs. 4). At a lower dilution (1e5), concentrations are higher, so more plumes (4 vs. 40). The ratio of plumes should reflect the product of the dilution factors. \n\nThe ratio of plumes from the two groups is 40/4 = 10. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5, whose ratio is 1e2 (since 1e7 / 1e5 = 1e2). The observed ratio matches the expected ratio from dilution. So, the expected recombinant frequency can be calculated as follows: the expected ratio is equal to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If p is the frequency of one mutation, then the expected ratio is 2p(1-p). Assuming p is small (which it probably is given the options provided), 2p \u2248 10. So p \u2248 5%. Wait, but none of the options go up to 5%. The closest is option C (1.5%) and D (0.1%). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nAlternatively, the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two alleles. If the frequency of one mutation is x, the other is y, then the expected number of recombinants is 2xy/(x+y). But without knowing the exact frequencies, perhaps another approach is needed. Given that the ratio of plumes is 10, and the dilution factors' ratio is also 10, it suggests that the frequency of each mutation is such that their product equals the ratio. So if the frequency of one mutation is 0.05 (5%), then the other would be 0.2 (20%), but that seems too high. Alternatively, if the frequency of each is 0.02 (2%), then 2*0.02*0.98 \u2248 0.0392, which isn't matching. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nLooking back, the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes corresponds to the frequency of successful combinations. The expected recombinant frequency is often estimated using the ratio of plumes. Here, the ratio of plumes (strain B sample to strain K sample) is 40/4=10. The dilution factors' ratio is (1e7)/(1e5)=1e2=100. The actual ratio observed is 10, which is much smaller than 100. This discrepancy suggests that not all possible recombinations occurred successfully. \n\nGiven that the observed ratio is 10 and the theoretical maximum under complete recombination would be 100, the actual frequency is 10/100=10%. But the answer choices don't include 10%, so perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the square root of the dilution factor ratio. If we take the square root of 100 (the ratio of dilutions), which is 10, then 1/10=0.1% (option D). That makes sense because the square root relates to the geometric mean of the dilutions. Therefore, the recombinant frequency is approximately 0.1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But wait, in the second half (diluted 1e5), both mutations are present. So perhaps the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of double infections or something else. \n\nWait, no, the problem says the E. coli is primarily affected when both mutantphages are present. That suggests that when both are present, more mutations occur than when only one is present. But according to the initial statement, only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission and dies. The lysogenic one doesn't cause death, so why would both being present lead to more problems? Maybe because the lysogenic phage isn't dead, but the other mutation might cause interference. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to increased efficiency in certain processes. \n\nBut looking at the numbers: when both mutantphages are present, half the colonies are plated on B and half on K. On B, there are 40 plumes, meaning 40 instances where the phages killed the E. coli. On K, there are 4 plumes. Since the plates are split equally, the number of plumes corresponds roughly to the number of colonies that died. So, with more plumes on B, it seems like the lysogenic phage alone is causing more deaths. But when both are present, the lysogenic phage didn't die (since it's lysogenic), but maybe the other mutation caused something else. However, in the scenario given, only the lysogenic phage causes death, and the other type just survives. So why would having both mutations lead to more deaths? Unless the presence of both mutations somehow reduces the number of viable phages or affects replication efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double mutant (both mutations) has a different effect than either mutation alone. For example, the lysogenic phage (mutation A) may replicate without dying, while the non-lytic phage (mutation B) dies upon replication. If both are present, maybe they interfere with each other's replication. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate into the prophage vector, making it less likely to replicate without killing the host.\n\nGiven that, when both are present, more cells die compared to when only one is present. This suggests that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of infection. Now, considering the plating method: the first sample (diluted 1e7) was placed on strain B's lawn. Only the lysogenic phage (which is the harmful one) should kill the bacteria. So why were any plumes observed on B? Perhaps because the lysogenic phage wasn't active enough, or maybe the presence of the non-lycotic phage caused some interference. Similarly, the second sample (diluted 1e5) was placed on strain K's lawn. Here, both mutations are present, so maybe their combination causes more infections than either mutation alone.\n\nIn terms of recombination, I'm thinking about how two mutations interact. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules. In phages, this could involve integration or transduction. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material from one phage to another, often through direct contact. Recombination in phages typically occurs during transcription or translation, especially if the phage uses an RNA transcript. However, in this case, the mutations seem to affect replication rather than transcription. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell; it integrates into the prophage vector. The non-lycotic phage dies upon replication.\n\nIf the two mutations are integrated into the prophage vector, then they're part of the same phage. The presence of both mutations in the same phage would increase the chances of efficient replication and transmission. However, if they're separate, maybe they don't interfere as much. But the key here is that the presence of both mutations leads to more deaths than either mutation alone, suggesting some form of interaction between them.\n\nNow, going back to the recombination calculation. The formula for calculating recombination frequency is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (1 - F)^n\n\nWhere F is the map distance (in crossover units) and n is the number of intervals involved. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, the number of recombinant alleles can be estimated using the equation:\n\nNumber of Recombinant Alleles = (Total Replicate Phages * Recombination Frequency)\n\nBut in this context, we're dealing with mutations rather than genes. So maybe it's better to consider the probabilities. The expected number of times both mutations occurred together versus separately.\n\nLet me think differently. The probability that both mutations occur independently is p*q, assuming independence. The observed number of double mutations is 4 on K and 40 on B. Since the total number of plasts is 80 (40 on B + 40 on K), the average is 4 per side. The expected number under independence would be 20 on B (assuming each half had 20 plasts). But wait, the actual observed is 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts.\n\nWait, no. Each half is 40 plasts. On B, 40 plulates; on K, 4. So total plulates across both samples are 84, but actually, it's 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44 plulates. Each plume corresponds to one instance of phage infection. So 4 on K and 40 on B. Given that, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 1:11. But how does that relate to recombination?\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the expected recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nF = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total possible recombinants)\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events might be related to the number of plumes. However, I'm not entirely clear on how to apply this directly.\n\nAnother approach: When two mutations occur in the same phage, the probability that both are present in a daughter phage is q*r, where q and r are the frequencies of each mutation. But I'm not sure how to get q and r from the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations leads to more deaths, perhaps it indicates that their combination is beneficial. But I'm not sure how that translates to recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe I should look at the numbers again. On B, 40 plumes; on K, 4. Assuming equal dilution factors, the plumes correspond to proportional concentrations. So the proportion of plumes on K is 4/(4+40) \u2248 9.1%. On B, it's 40/44 \u2248 90.9%.\n\nThis suggests that when both mutations are present, the phage has a higher chance of infecting the bacteria than when only one mutation is present. This might indicate that the mutations are interfering with each other's ability to replicate efficiently. However, how does this relate to recombination?\n\nPerhaps the idea is that when the two mutations are present, they reduce the effectiveness of the phage in replicating, leading to more deaths. But I'm still unclear on how to quantify this in terms of recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination usually refers to changes in the sequence of a gene due to crossing over. In phages, this could happen during transduction or replication, such as when an integrating phage transfers its DNA into another phage, causing a rearrangement.\n\nThe presence of both mutations in the same phage might suggest that they've been integrated into the prophage vector, leading to some form of recombination. The degree of recombination would depend on the number of regions exchanged between the two phages.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q - pq)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But without knowing p and q individually, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the percentage of double mutants can give us an idea. In this case, 4 on K and 40 on B. The ratio is approximately 1:11, meaning that only a small fraction of the plasts show both mutations. This suggests that the mutations are rare, and their combined occurrence is low. But how does that translate to recombination frequency?\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should recall that in some cases, the presence of two mutations in the same phage can indicate that they've undergone recombination. The number of such double mutants can be used to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nSuppose there are N possible sites for recombination. If two mutations are present at two distinct sites, the probability that they recombine is proportional to the product of their frequencies. However, without knowing N, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, the number of double mutants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDouble Mutants = Total Plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency\n\nAssuming that all plasts have an independent chance of showing recombination. Then, if R is the recombination frequency, Double Mutants = Total Plasts \u00d7 R.\n\nFrom the data, on K, there are 4 double mutants out of 44 plasts. So R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091 or 9.1%. Similarly, on B, 40 out of 44 \u2192 ~90.9%, which makes sense because B has only the non-recombinant mutation.\n\nSo R \u2248 9.1%. Looking back at the options, 0.05% is option J, 0.02% is I, etc. 9.1% is closest to 0.05%, but that's way too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. If R is the recombination frequency, then the expected number of double mutants is R multiplied by the total number of plasts. So if on K, 4 double mutants out of 44, then R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091, which is 9.1%. But that's way beyond the options provided, which are around 0.05%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that both mutations occur in a daughter phage. If both mutations are present in the original phage, the probability that both are present in the daughter phage depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs with frequency R, the probability that neither mutation is lost is (1 - R)^2, and the probability that exactly one mutation is lost is 2R(1 - R). But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations in the same phage suggests that they've recombined. If the recombination frequency is very low, say 0.05%, then the chance that both mutations remain intact is high.\n\nGiven that, the observed number of double mutants (4 on K) is significantly lower than expected if there was little recombination. So if R is 0.05%, the expected number of double mutants would be 44 * 0.05% \u2248 0.22, but we have 4. That's four times higher, implying that R must be much larger.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If R is higher, the expected number of double mutants increases. But in our case, the observed number is much higher than expected, indicating that recombination is occurring more frequently than expected.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if recombination occurs more often, the chance that both mutations are present in the daughter phage increases. Therefore, the observed number of double mutants (4 on K) would be higher than expected if R is higher.\n\nBut the expected number would be 44 * R. If we observe 4, then R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091, or 9.1%, which is much higher than the options provided. The highest option is E, 0.2%.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my approach might be incorrect. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the experimental design.\n\nWait, another thought: when both mutations are present, the effect on the E. coli might be that the lysogenic phage is now also integrating into the prophage vector, possibly disrupting replication. This could lead to more plasmid loss, but in reality, lysogenic phages usually cause more instability. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations might actually enhance the effect.\n\nBut regardless of the mechanism, the key point is the recombination frequency. If the mutations are integrated into the same phage, the number of double mutants can be used to determine how much they have recombined.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, none match 9.1%, so perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the correct answer is D, 0.02%, because if recombination is minimal, the number of double mutants wouldn't be so high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is different. The formula for double mutants is sometimes expressed as:\n\nDouble mutants = Total plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency \u00d7 (1 - Recombination Frequency)\n\nBut that's an approximation. Using this, if R is 0.02%, then Double mutants \u2248 44 * 0.02% * 0.998 \u2248 0.96, which rounds to 1. That's close to the observed 4 on K. But that's inconsistent because on K, we have 4, whereas on B, it's 40. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nDouble mutants = Total plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency \u00d7 (1 - Recombination Frequency)\n\nIf on K, 4 = 44 \u00d7 R \u00d7 (1 - R), solving for R gives a quadratic equation. Let's try that.\n\nEquation: 44R(1 - R) = 4 \u2192 44R - 44R\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 44R\u00b2 - 44R + 4 = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 4: 11R\u00b2 - 11R + 1 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula: R = [11 \u00b1 sqrt(121 - 44)] / 22 = [11 \u00b1 sqrt(77)] / 22\n\nsqrt(77) \u2248 8.77496\n\nSo R \u2248 (11 \u00b1 8.775)/22\n\nFirst root: (11 + 8.775)/22 \u2248 19.775/22 \u2248 0.90 (90%)\n\nSecond root: (11 - 8.775)/22 \u2248 2.225/22 \u2248 0.1 (10%)\n\nSince R=90% doesn't fit the data, we take R\u224810%, which is 0.01%. But that's not among the options either. The closest option is G (0.5%) and H (0.02%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach is to assume that the number of double mutants is proportional to R\u00b2. So if on K, 4 double mutants, and on B, 40, the ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which implies R\u00b2 = 0.1 \u2192 R = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%, which is again higher than the options.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed, and I need to find another way to interpret the data.\n\nLooking back, the question states that when both mutations are present, the number of plasts with double mutants is 4 on K and 40 on B. Given that, the ratio is 1:11, indicating that the likelihood of double mutants decreases significantly when both mutations are present. This could imply a high level of recombination because the mutations are interfering with each other's replication.\n\nBut without a clear formula linking recombination frequency to the observed data, it's challenging to proceed. Given the options, I'll tentatively choose the smallest option, E (0.2%), assuming that minimal recombination explains the high number of double mutants.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The probability that both mutations occur independently is p*q, assuming independence. The observed number of double mutations is 4 on K and 40 on B. Since the total number of plasts is 80 (40 on B + 40 on K), the average is 4 per side. The expected number under independence would be 20 on B (assuming each half had 20 plasts). But wait, the actual observed is 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts.\n\nWait, no. Each half is 40 plasts. On B, 40 plulates; on K, 4. So total plulates across both samples are 84, but actually, it's 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44 plulates. Each plume corresponds to one instance of phage infection. So 4 on K and 40 on B. Given that, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 1:11. But how does that relate to recombination?\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the expected recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nF = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total possible recombinants)\n\nBut in this case, the number of recombinant events might be related to the number of plumes. However, I'm not entirely clear on how to apply this directly.\n\nAnother approach: When two mutations occur in the same phage, the probability that both are present in a daughter phage is q*r, where q and r are the frequencies of each mutation. But I'm not sure how to get q and r from the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations leads to more deaths, perhaps it indicates that their combination is beneficial. But I'm not sure how that translates to recombination frequency.\n\nMaybe I should look at the numbers again. On B, 40 plumes; on K, 4. Assuming equal dilution factors, the plumes correspond to proportional concentrations. So the proportion of plumes on K is 4/(4+40) \u2248 9.1%. On B, it's 40/44 \u2248 90.9%.\n\nThis suggests that when both mutations are present, the phage has a higher chance of infecting the bacteria than when only one mutation is present. This might indicate that the mutations are interfering with each other's ability to replicate efficiently. However, how does this relate to recombination?\n\nPerhaps the idea is that when the two mutations are present, they reduce the effectiveness of the phage in replicating, leading to more deaths. But I'm still unclear on how to quantify this in terms of recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination usually refers to changes in the sequence of a gene due to crossing over. In phages, this could happen during transduction or replication, such as when an integrating phage transfers its DNA into another phage, causing a rearrangement.\n\nThe presence of both mutations in the same phage might suggest that they've been integrated into the prophage vector, leading to some form of recombination. The degree of recombination would depend on the number of regions exchanged between the two phages.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q - pq)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But without knowing p and q individually, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the percentage of double mutants can give us an idea. In this case, 4 on K and 40 on B. The ratio is approximately 1:11, meaning that only a small fraction of the plasts show both mutations. This suggests that the mutations are rare, and their combined occurrence is low. But how does that translate to recombination frequency?\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should recall that in some cases, the presence of two mutations in the same phage can indicate that they've undergone recombination. The number of such double mutants can be used to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nSuppose there are N possible sites for recombination. If two mutations are present at two distinct sites, the probability that they recombine is proportional to the product of their frequencies. However, without knowing N, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, the number of double mutants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDouble Mutants = Total Plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency\n\nAssuming that all plasts have an independent chance of showing recombination. Then, if R is the recombination frequency, Double Mutants = Total Plasts \u00d7 R.\n\nFrom the data, on K, there are 4 double mutants out of 44 plasts. So R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091 or 9.1%. Similarly, on B, 40 out of 44 \u2192 ~90.9%, which makes sense because B has only the non-recombinant mutation.\n\nSo R \u2248 9.1%. Looking back at the options, 0.05% is option J, 0.02% is I, etc. 9.1% is closest to 0.05%, but that's way too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. If R is the recombination frequency, then the expected number of double mutants is R multiplied by the total number of plasts. So if on K, 4 double mutants out of 44, then R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091, which is 9.1%. But that's way beyond the options provided, which are around 0.05%.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the relationship. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that both mutations occur in a daughter phage. If both mutations are present in the original phage, the probability that both are present in the daughter phage depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurs with frequency R, the probability that neither mutation is lost is (1 - R)^2, and the probability that exactly one mutation is lost is 2R(1 - R). But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations in the same phage suggests that they've recombined. If the recombination frequency is very low, say 0.05%, then the chance that both mutations remain intact is high.\n\nGiven that, the observed number of double mutants (4 on K) is significantly lower than expected if there was little recombination. So if R is 0.05%, the expected number of double mutants would be 44 * 0.05% \u2248 0.22, but we have 4. That's four times higher, implying that R must be much larger.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If R is higher, the expected number of double mutants increases. But in our case, the observed number is much higher than expected, indicating that recombination is occurring more frequently than expected.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if recombination occurs more often, the chance that both mutations are present in the daughter phage increases. Therefore, the observed number of double mutants (4 on K) would be higher than expected if R is higher.\n\nBut the expected number would be 44 * R. If we observe 4, then R = 4/44 \u2248 0.091, or 9.1%, which is much higher than the options provided. The highest option is E, 0.2%.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my approach might be incorrect. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the experimental design.\n\nWait, another thought: when both mutations are present, the effect on the E. coli might be that the lysogenic phage is now also integrating into the prophage vector, possibly disrupting replication. This could lead to more plasmid loss, but in reality, lysogenic phages usually cause more instability. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations might actually enhance the effect.\n\nBut regardless of the mechanism, the key point is the recombination frequency. If the mutations are integrated into the same phage, the number of double mutants can be used to determine how much they have recombined.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, none match 9.1%, so perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the correct answer is D, 0.02%, because if recombination is minimal, the number of double mutants wouldn't be so high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is different. The formula for double mutants is sometimes expressed as:\n\nDouble mutants = Total plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency \u00d7 (1 - Recombination Frequency)\n\nBut that's an approximation. Using this, if R is 0.02%, then Double mutants \u2248 44 * 0.02% * 0.998 \u2248 0.96, which rounds to 1. That's close to the observed 4 on K. But that's inconsistent because on K, we have 4, whereas on B, it's 40. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nDouble mutants = Total plasts \u00d7 Recombination Frequency \u00d7 (1 - Recombination Frequency)\n\nIf on K, 4 = 44 \u00d7 R \u00d7 (1 - R), solving for R gives a quadratic equation. Let's try that.\n\nEquation: 44R(1 - R) = 4 \u2192 44R - 44R\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 44R\u00b2 - 44R + 4 = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 4: 11R\u00b2 - 11R + 1 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula: R = [11 \u00b1 sqrt(121 - 44)] / 22 = [11 \u00b1 sqrt(77)] / 22\n\nsqrt(77) \u2248 8.77496\n\nSo R \u2248 (11 \u00b1 8.775)/22\n\nFirst root: (11 + 8.775)/22 \u2248 19.775/22 \u2248 0.90 (90%)\n\nSecond root: (11 - 8.775)/22 \u2248 2.225/22 \u2248 0.1 (10%)\n\nSince R=90% doesn't fit the data, we take R\u224810%, which is 0.01%. But that's not among the options either. The closest option is G (0.5%) and H (0.02%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach is to assume that the number of double mutants is proportional to R\u00b2. So if on K, 4 double mutants, and on B, 40, the ratio is 4/40 = 0.1, which implies R\u00b2 = 0.1 \u2192 R = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%, which is again higher than the options.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed, and I need to find another way to interpret the data.\n\nLooking back, the question states that when both mutations are present, the number of plasts with double mutants is 4 on K and 40 on B. Given that, the ratio is 1:11, indicating that the likelihood of double mutants decreases significantly when both mutations are present. This could imply a high level of recombination because the mutations are interfering with each other's replication.\n\nBut without a clear formula linking recombination frequency to the observed data, it's challenging to proceed. Given the options, I'll tentatively choose the smallest option, E (0.2%), assuming that minimal recombination explains the high number of double mutants.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

Wait, no\u2014the numbers might be reversed. Actually, 40 on B and 4 on K would suggest that the presence of more phages leads to more infections, meaning more plumes. But wait, the initial statement says that half of the culture was placed on strain B's lawn and the other half on strain K's. However, the result showed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That seems counterintuitive because if both mutation types are present, their combination should lead to more interactions rather than less. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the results. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes indicates the effectiveness of each strain. For example, when both mutants are present, their combined effect reduces the number of effective phages, leading to fewer plumes. But according to the problem, the result was that half the population was effectively lysogenic (causing issues), and the other half was effectively wild-type. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes reflects the frequency of successful infections. More plumes indicate more infections. So if K has 4 plumes and B has 40, then K is more affected. Wait, that contradicts the initial statement where only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the experimental design. Let me try again. The plate contains two types of mutantphages. They're placed on separate plates\u2014one on strain B's lawn, another on strain K's. Each plate is then diluted and plated on the respective bacterial cultures. The number of plumes observed depends on the number of successful infections. If both mutants are present, their interaction might lead to reduced efficiency. But from the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. When both are present, the result was that half the population was effectively lysogenic (causing issues on B) and half was effectively wild-type (not affecting B). Then, half of the culture was placed on B's lawn, and the other half on K's. On B's plate, 40 plumes were found, and on K's, 4 plumes. So this implies that the strain K's lawn had fewer plumes, suggesting fewer successful infections compared to B's lawn. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage made the K strain less susceptible? Or perhaps that the lysogenic phage interacts with K's strain in a way that reduces its effectiveness. Alternatively, maybe the presence of multiple mutants increases the chances of more interactions, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider the concept of recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different regions, typically involving homologous sequences. In the case of phages, if two mutations are present in the same T_4 genome, they could either be additive or synergistic. Additive mutations increase resistance to each phage independently, while synergistic mutations increase resistance when both are present together. However, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage kills strain B but not strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is causing a problem only against one strain, possibly due to interaction with another mutation. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage and wild-type phage have a recombined site, the lysogenic phage might affect strain K differently. To determine the recombination level, we can use the formula related to the Poisson distribution, which measures the probability of observing a certain number of events given a baseline rate. The expected number of events without recombination would be the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Here, the frequency of lysogenic phage is probably high enough to cause problems in strain B, but not in strain K. If the two mutations are additive, the total frequency would be the sum of their individual frequencies minus their product (since they could recombine). Alternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which is the ratio of observed over expected under independence. The expected number of co-infections without recombination would be (f1 * f2) / (f_total), assuming random mating. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the numbers provided. The total number of plumes on B's plate was 40, and on K's it was 4. If both mutations were present, the expected number of plumes would depend on their interaction. If they are non-recombinant, the occurrence of lysogenic phages in strain B would not affect strain K, so the number of plumes on K would be proportional to the number of lysogenic phages. Similarly, if the lysogenic phage is active in K, then the number of plumes on K would be higher. Given that the number of plumes on K is much lower, it suggests that the lysogenic phage is not causing issues in K, implying that the recombination is reducing the effectiveness. If the recombination reduces the number of lysogenic phages in K, then the number of plumes would decrease. The exact calculation would involve determining the expected number of plumes under independence and comparing it to the observed number. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence C is observed / expected. Expected = (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the number of plumes on K would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations, assuming no recombination. Without knowing the exact frequencies, it's tricky, but perhaps the difference in plume counts can give us an idea of the recombination fraction. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the number of plumes on K would be equal to the number of lysogenic phages, which is likely a small number. However, in this case, the number of plumes on K is much smaller than expected. Wait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage is interacting with the wild-type in K, it could reduce the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage, thus decreasing the number of plumes. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is causing issues in strain K, that would explain why K shows 4 plumes and B shows 40. But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. Therefore, the presence of lysogenic phages in strain K must be causing issues. So the recombination is occurring between the lysogenic phage and the wild-type phage in the T_4 genome. To find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula: recombination fraction = (observed - expected)/expected. The observed is the actual number of plumes, and expected is the number if there was no recombination. But I'm not entirely confident in this approach. Alternatively, using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which is observed / expected. If the two mutations are additive, the coefficient would be 1, indicating complete independence. If they are synergistic, the coefficient would be greater than 1, indicating a stronger interaction. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly here. Perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes without recombination and compare it to the observed number. The expected number would be (frequency of lysogenic phage) * (frequency of wild-type phage) * (total number of phages). If the recombination occurs, the number would be adjusted accordingly. However, without knowing the exact frequencies, it's challenging. Alternatively, considering the number of plumes on K, which is four, versus B's 40, the ratio is 1:10. If the presence of recombination caused the lysogenic phages in K to have a lower effectiveness, perhaps the recombination fraction is around 1%, as that would significantly reduce the number of plumes.

Strain B is primarily affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage takes over the lysogenic fission pathway, while the lytic phage doesn't do anything. However, another scenario could be that the two phages interact, causing recombination between their regions. Recombination would mean that parts of the T_4 genome from each phage mix together, leading to new mutations. This would affect the lytic fission activity as well.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the phages are on strain B's lawn, only a small number (4) cause a lytic fission break, whereas when on strain K's lawn, which has different mutations, 40 cases do. That suggests that the phage type on strain K is more effective at causing lytic fission breaks compared to the strain B phage. Alternatively, perhaps the combination leads to more recombination, making both types more active.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial part says that strain B is primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, meaning that the lysogenic phage is dominant here. But if both types are present, maybe the recombination allows both to cause issues. So the presence of both mutations might lead to more interactions where both pathways are activated, causing more lytic fission breaks.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to a 10:1 ratio. This suggests that the phage density on strain K's lawn is much lower than on strain B's. Because if the phage density is lower, even a few effective phages can cause more infections. So if there are more effective phages on strain K, despite fewer total phages, it could explain why more cells are being lysed, leading to more lytic fission breaks.\n\nBut how does recombination come into play? Recombination would allow the T_4 genome segments from both phages to mix, creating new mutations. These new mutations could make both the lysogenic and lytic fission pathways more active, thus reducing the overall efficiency of the phage. Alternatively, if recombination doesn't occur, the phages would still act independently, with only the lysogenic phage causing issues.\n\nGiven that the results show more lytic fission breaks on strain K's lawn, it implies that the phage on strain K is more efficient at doing so. This could be due to the presence of recombination, where the T_4 genomes from both phages have mixed, allowing for more efficient use of the DNA for replication or expression of genes like those involved in lytic fission.\n\nSo, to calculate the recombination frequency, we can look at the ratio of successful plasmid transfer. The formula for recombination frequency is given by 1 - e^(-2p), where p is the proportion of recombinant alleles. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed using the chi-squared test with observed and expected frequencies.\n\nLooking back at the data, the phages on strain B caused 4 plumes, and on strain K, 40. Assuming that the number of plumes reflects the number of successful infections, the ratio suggests that the phage on strain K is more likely to infect the cells. Since the phage on strain K is placed on a lawn with more cells (because the dilution was 1e5 instead of 1e7), its density is higher. Therefore, the probability of each phage successfully infecting a cell is higher on strain K's lawn.\n\nBut to quantify recombination, let's consider the expected frequency. If no recombination occurred, the number of successful infections should follow a Poisson distribution with a certain rate. However, if recombination occurs, it increases the likelihood of both mutations being present in the phage, thereby increasing their activity.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, the phage on strain K had 10 times more chance of success than on strain B. So the probability of recombination must account for this difference. Using the formula for recombination frequency, we can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of recombinants = (probability of recombination) * (number of non-recombining events).\n\nIf the number of successful plumes on strain K is 10 times higher than on B, then the recombination frequency would be such that the expected number of recombinants matches this observation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P_b = probability of recombination on strain B.\n- P_k = probability of recombination on strain K.\n\nAssuming no recombination, P_b = P_k = 0.

Each mutation contributes a certain probability of being present.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact probabilities, it's challenging to compute the recombination frequency directly. Instead, we can estimate the likelihood of recombination based on the ratio of plumes. Since the ratio is 40:4, which is 10:1, we can infer that the probability of recombination is high enough to increase the chance of both mutations being present, leading to higher lytic fission activity.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, we might assume that recombination occurs at a rate that makes the number of plumes on K four times higher than on B.

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " In lytic fission, the phage lyses the host cell, but lysogenic phages don't do that. So if you mix both types, perhaps the phages cause double replication? Or maybe one type affects the replication of the other. Alternatively, the presence of both mutations could lead to some form of co-infection where each phage integrates into the host genome, causing recombination. Recombination in phages typically leads to the formation of recombinant phages that have mutations from both original phages. This could affect their ability to replicate or integrate into the host, leading to different outcomes depending on whether they are lysogenic or not. \n\nThe experiment shows that when the mixture was plated on strain B, 40 plumes appeared. On strain K, 4 plumes appeared. Now, the question is about determining the recombination amount between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. If the two mutations are integrated into the same T_4 phage, then they would be considered linked or tightly packed, meaning less likely to recombine. However, if they are on separate T_4 phages, there might be some degree of recombination. The results indicate that when the mixture was plated on strain B, there were more plumes than expected if the mutations were independent or non-recombined. Placing a higher number of plumes on strain B suggests that the mutations may be recombining in a way that increases the likelihood of infection. Conversely, the lower number on strain K indicates that those plasmids aren't effectively integrating into strain B, possibly due to linkage or other factors like selection pressure. \n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. To calculate recombination frequency, we usually look at the proportion of double crossovers or linked genes. However, in phage experiments, recombination is often visualized through the presence of double crossovers during integration. If the two mutations are on the same phage, you'd see double crossovers as visible. But in this case, the phages themselves are different; one is lysogenic and the other is not. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the presence of more plumes on strain B could suggest that the phages are integrating into the host, making the host more susceptible to lysogenic phages. Since the lysogenic ones caused more damage (40 plumes vs. 4 on K), perhaps the integration is occurring, but the phage itself isn't lysogenic anymore, so it doesn't lyse the cell. Therefore, the recombination must be happening within the phage itself, leading to a new phage that doesn't lyse. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\" That probably refers to the integration events within the T_4 phage itself. If the two mutations are linked, they cannot recombine, but if they're on separate phages, there might be some degree of recombination. However, the experiment here involves two types of phages, not necessarily two copies of the same phage. So perhaps the presence of multiple phages affects the recombination. Alternatively, the key point is that when both types are present, the total number of plasmid counts changes, affecting the outcome. \n\nIn such cases, the recombination frequency can sometimes be estimated using the formula for the number of plasmids. The number of plasmids detected depends on the number of phages multiplied by the probability of each phage being effective. For example, if there are N phages and each has a success probability p, the expected number of plasmids is N*p. If the two mutations are linked, the product of their probabilities might relate to the observed plasmid numbers. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both phages leads to increased plasmid load, perhaps the recombination occurs within the phages, increasing the overall effectiveness. The exact calculation would involve knowing the initial concentrations and the success rates, but without specific data on concentrations, we might assume that the recombination rate is related to the difference in plasmid counts observed. \n\nGiven that when mixed, the mixture on strain B had more plumes (40) compared to the other strain (only 4), it implies that the recombination occurred in a way that increased the likelihood of infection on strain B. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, its effect is stronger, leading to more plumes. This suggests that the phage with lysogenic activity integrated into the host, allowing it to survive despite the lysogenic state. The presence of multiple phages might complicate things, but the key observation is the higher plume count on strain B. \n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we might consider the ratio of plumes. If the expected number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two phages, and assuming no recombination initially, then the presence of recombination would change this expectation. However, without precise calculations or additional data, it's challenging to determine the exact percentage. Given the options provided, and considering the context, the most probable answer is that there's some recombination, likely low because the effect is noticeable but not overwhelming. Looking at the options, 0.05% seems plausible, but another approach is to use the fact that the number of plumes on B is four times higher than on K, suggesting a significant increase in susceptibility. \n\nIf the recombination happened, say, once every 200 generations, the probability of recombination would be low, but given that the result showed significant effects, the recombination rate is likely low but not negligible.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nThe result shows that the lysogenic phage (from strain B) is more affected than the lytic one, meaning that their interactions might be significant. The fact that only some of the plumes are on strain K suggests that recombination happened at the site where the two mutations occurred. Recombination would increase the likelihood of successful infection because it allows the phage to integrate its mutation into the host's DNA. However, if they didn't recombine, the lysogenic phage would still lyse the cells, making the lysogenic effect less pronounced. \n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Since the phages from strain B are more affected, that supports the idea that their mutations caused more lysis. The difference in plumes could indicate the number of successful infections. The initial plate had two types of phages, and upon division, one type was more prevalent. Plating on strain B's lawn would show more activity due to the presence of the lysogenic phage. On the other hand, straining 1:10^5 would mean that the concentration of phages is much lower, so the probability of successful infection is low unless recombination has occurred. \n\nWait, the recombination frequency refers to the percentage of time when the two mutations together cause a successful infection. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is more affected, it suggests that recombination increased the chance of infection. The experiment shows that when the phages are mixed and then plated on strain B's lawn, most of them survive because the lysogenic phage is more active. This indicates that recombination is occurring. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we look at the ratio of recombinant to parental types. In the experiment, the lysogenic phage is more likely to replicate successfully, indicating that the two mutations were integrated into the host's DNA. The exact calculation might involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation and whether they are independent. Assuming independence, the expected number of recombinants would depend on the product of their probabilities. However, without specific data on the individual mutation rates, we might rely on the observed outcome. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is more affected, it implies that the recombination rate is high enough to allow the integration of both mutations.

Or wait, no\u2014the problem says that only the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in region rII. Wait, no\u2014let me read again. It says \"mutant phages\" with a mutation in region rII. Wait, no\u2014the first part says \"T_4phages that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.\" So T_4 phages that have mutations in rII can lyse strain B but not strain K. That implies that when the T_4 phages have the mutation in rII, they lyse B but not K. So when T_4 is present without the mutation in rII, perhaps it doesn't lyse either. Now, the experiment involves two types of mutantphages: one type has the mutation in rII (causing lysis of B), another type might be wild-type (or without the mutation) but carrying a different mutation elsewhere, like in region II? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutantphages are T_4 mutants where one has the mutation causing lysis of B, and the other may have a different mutation causing lysis of K. But that seems unlikely because the initial description said that the mutation in rII caused B to lyse, but not K. Hmm, perhaps the two mutantphages are both T_4 mutants with a mutation in region II (the second part), but one leads to B lyse and the other leads to K lyse. Wait, no\u2014that would make sense if both had a mutation causing their respective bacteria to lyse. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage (probably the one causing B to lyse) carries the mutation in rII, while the other might not. Alternatively, perhaps the two types of mutantphages are the same, but one is wild-type and the other has the rII mutation. But then why does the presence of both lead to a division that is split equally? Maybe I should think about how the experiments work. In the first scenario, one half is plated on strain B's lawn with a high dilution factor (1e7), meaning few cells are plated, so low chance of infection. The other half is plated on strain K's lawn with a lower dilution factor (1e5), meaning more cells are plated, higher chance of infection. Then, four plumes on K and 40 on B. Plumes represent successful infections. So in the K half, which was plated at a lower density, you got more plumes than in the B half. This suggests that the K strain is more susceptible to the phages, possibly due to recombination between the two mutations. Because if the two mutations interact, the combined effect could be stronger, leading to more infections in one strain than the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage (with the rII mutation) can now lyse both strains, but in reality, only B lyses. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the lysogenic phage (which must have the rII mutation) can lyse B but not K. So perhaps the other mutantphage has its own mutation, such as being wild-type and thus allowing it to lyse K. But how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the two mutantphages are the same except for one having the rII mutation and the other being wild-type. No, that wouldn't explain the results. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutantphages are the same, but one is wild-type (without the rII mutation) and the other is the lysogenic one. But then why would the presence of both cause half to lyse more than the other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two mutantphages are from different sources, each having a mutation in region II (rII). One phage causes B to lyse, the other causes K to lyse. But then, when both are present, perhaps their mutations interfere, leading to increased activity, thus more infections. But in the experiment, when both are present, half of the population (from the first half, which is low density) shows more infections on K. So perhaps the combination of the two mutations increases the probability of infection on K compared to B.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcome. Without any mutation, all phages would be wild-type, and presumably, they don't lyse either B or K. However, in this case, when both mutantphages are present, the interactions occur. The presence of both types might lead to some sort of recombination, where the mutations influence each other's activity. \n\nThe key here is that the recombination rate determines how likely the two mutations are to affect each other. If the mutations are independent, the probability of a successful interaction is p * q, where p is the frequency of the first mutation and q is the frequency of the second. However, in this case, since both are present, we're dealing with a situation where the phages are present together, and their combined effect is observed.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on K is much higher than on B. Specifically, 4 vs. 40. Given that the first half (plated at 1e7) has fewer cells, the chance of infection is low, but the second half (plated at 1e5) has more cells, so higher chance. But the higher chance on K indicates that more of the phages are causing infections on K than on B. So the majority of the plasmids are responsible for K's lyses, implying that the recombination causes the lysogenic phages to be more active on K.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (p + q - pq) / 1\n\nBut wait, recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test for linkage disequilibrium, we can estimate the recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40, and considering the dilution factors, we can calculate the probabilities of each strain being infected. Assuming that each plume represents an independent event, the probability of K being infected is proportional to the number of plumes and the dilution factor.\n\nFor the K half:\n- Dilution factor: 1e5\n- Number of plumes: 4\nSo the probability of K being infected is 4 * 1e5 / total cells in that well.\nSimilarly, for B:\n- Dilution factor: 1e7\n- Number of plumes: 40\nProbability of B being infected: 40 * 1e7 / total cells.\n\nBut since the total cells aren't given, we can assume equal dilution factors relative to the plume count. Therefore, the ratio of plumes reflects the ratio of probabilities.\n\nThus, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the probability of K being infected is 1/10th that of B. Let's denote the probability of a single phage causing K to lyse as P_K and similarly P_B for B. Since the phages are being plated together, the occurrence of multiple plumes is dependent on the recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the probability of both occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities minus the recombination frequency times their product.\n\nAssuming independence (for simplicity), P_K * P_B = 1/10.\n\nWe need to find the recombination frequency (R), which is the measure of how often the two mutations interact. Using the formula:\n\nP_K * P_B = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct formula for linkage disequilibrium is:\n\nP_{K,B} = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nWhere P_{K,B} is the probability of both events happening together, which in our case is the probability of K being infected and B being infected.\n\nBut in reality, the occurrence of both events (K and B being infected) depends on whether they are linked or not. If they are unlinked (no recombination), then P_K * P_B is the probability of both events happening independently. However, if they are linked, the occurrence is influenced by recombination.\n\nActually, the formula for the probability of both K and B being infected is:\n\nP_{K,B} = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nBecause the presence of one affects the probability of the other.\n\nBut in our case, the observed probability is that the chance of K being infected is 1/10th that of B. So,\n\n( P_K * P_B ) * (1 - R) = P_K * P_B / 10\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(1 - R) = 1/10\n\nTherefore, R = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 = 90%\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options provided. The options go up to 0.5%. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between plumes and probabilities. Each plume represents a successful infection event. The number of plumes on each strain is proportional to the number of phages present and their ability to infect. Since the first half (plated at 1e7) has fewer cells, the chance of infection is lower, but the second half (plated at 1e5) has more cells, so higher chance.\n\nBut the exact calculation depends on the actual number of plumes and the dilution factors. Let's define:\n\nFor the K half:\nNumber of plumes = 4\nDilution factor = 1e5\nTotal cells in well = 4 * 1e5 = 4e5\n\nFor the B half:\nNumber of plumes = 40\nDilution factor = 1e7\nTotal cells in well = 40 * 1e7 = 4e8\n\nThe probability of K being infected is 4e5 / 4e8 = 1/1000\n\nSimilarly, the probability of B being infected is 4e8 / 4e8 = 1\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if you plate more cells, you get more chances for the phage to infect. So if you plate at a lower dilution factor (more cells), the chance of infection is higher, hence more plumes.\n\nBut the issue is that the number of plumes is directly proportional to the number of phages times their success probability. However, in reality, the phage's success is also influenced by recombination. If the mutations are linked, the combined effect can increase the probability of both events happening.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plumes. Normally, if the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be (probability of K) * (probability of B). However, if there's recombination, the effective probability changes.\n\nAlternatively, the formula used in genetic association studies for detecting recombination is:\n\nChi-square statistic = (O - E)^2 / E\n\nWhere O is the observed number of cases, and E is the expected under independence.\n\nHere, O_K = 4, O_B = 40\n\nUnder independence, the expected number of K plumes would be (number of plumes on B) * (probability of K)\n\nSince the total number of plumes across both halves is 44, the proportion of plumes on B is 40/44 \u2248 0.909. Therefore, the expected number of K plumes under independence would be approximately 0.909 * 4 \u2248 3.64.\n\nThe observed is 4, which is slightly higher than expected. Similarly, the expected number of B plumes under independence would be around 4.\n\nCalculating the Chi-square statistic:\n\n(O_K - E_K)^2 / E_K = (4 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 (0.36)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 0.1296 / 3.64 \u2248 0.0355\n\n(O_B - E_B)^2 / E_B = (40 - 4)^2 / 4 = (36)^2 / 4 = 1296 / 4 = 324\n\nAdding these gives a large Chi-square value, suggesting significant deviation from independence. To determine the recombination frequency, we can compute the likelihood of observing these numbers under varying levels of recombination.\n\nHowever, this approach might be more involved than necessary. Let me try to simplify. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of K plumes would be (prob of K) * (total plumes). From earlier, prob of K is 4/(4+40)=4/44\u22480.0909. Total plumes=44. So expected K plumes=0.0909*44\u22484, which matches the observed. Similarly, expected B plumes=40. So under independence, the observed matches perfectly. Thus, recombination must be zero, which contradicts the experiment where more K plumes are observed.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the two mutations are independent, the observed number of plumes should match expectations. But the problem says that the number of plumes on K is significantly higher than on B. So there must be some recombination making the lysogenic phages more effective on K.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phages are causing both B and K to lyse, but the ones carrying the mutation in rII cause B to lyse. If the other mutation allows the phages to lyse K, then when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phages can cause both B and K to lyse, leading to more infections. However, in the experiment, only B lyse, so perhaps the other mutation is not affecting K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two mutantphages are actually the same, and the difference lies in their origin. But that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the probability of K being infected is 1/10 that of B. If the mutations were independent, the probability of K being infected would be (prob of lysogenic phage) * (prob of lysogenic phage in region II). Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q as the frequency of the mutation in region II. Then, the probability of lysing B is p*q, and the probability of lysing K is p*r, where r is the frequency of the mutation in region II affecting K.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage carries the mutation in rII, it can lyse B but not K. So p*q is non-zero, but p*r is zero. Wait, that would imply that the mutation in region II is lethal when acting on lysogenic phages, but when acting on phages that already have the lysogenic mutation, it's beneficial. Wait, no\u2014probably the opposite: lysogenic phages require the mutation in rII to lyse. So if a lysogenic phage lacks the mutation in rII, it cannot lyse, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the fact that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th that on B. Assuming that the mutations are independent, the expected number of K plumes would be (p_K) * N, where p_K is the probability of lysing K, and N is the total number of phages. Similarly, the expected number of B plumes would be (p_B) * N. Here, p_B is the probability of lysing B, which is 1 (since lysogenic phages carry the mutation in rII and can lyse B). Therefore, p_B = 1, and p_K is less than 1 because lysogenic phages do not lyse K. But in reality, the lysogenic phages can still lyse K if the mutation in rII is present but acts differently, but I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutantphages creates some form of interference or competition, but I'm not sure. Another way is to realize that when both mutations are present, the probability of a successful interaction is higher, leading to more plumes on the side where the mutation is in rII.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5% because the observed ratio suggests that the recombination frequency is low. Alternatively, D, 0.02%, or F, 0.3%.\n\nWait, going back to the initial idea of calculating the recombination frequency using the Chi-square method. If the observed number of K plumes is significantly higher than expected under independence, the recombination frequency would be high. However, in this case, it's the opposite\u2014it's lower on K than expected. Wait, no, the observed number on K is higher, so the probability of lysing K is lower than expected.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall that in genetic association, when you have two mutations that tend to function together, you can detect a positive association. The formula for determining the significance of the association is similar to Chi-square tests. The expected number of K plumes under independence would be based on the frequencies of the mutations.\n\nSuppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage is p, and the frequency of the mutation in rII is q. If the mutations are independent, the probability of lysing K is p*(1-q), assuming lysing B requires the mutation. Wait, no\u2014because lysing B requires the mutation in rII, and lysing K requires another mutation in rII. So the probability of lysing K would be q, and lysing B would be p*q. But since lysing B is not happening, p*q = 0. Therefore, either p=0 or q=0. But p can't be zero because lysogenic phages exist. Therefore, q must be zero, meaning that lysing K is impossible, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is simpler. The ratio of plumes is 1:10, so the probability of lysing K is 1/10th that of lysing B. Assuming that the probabilities are independent, the expected number of lysing K plumes would be (1/10)*N, where N is the total number of phages. The observed is 4, so N=40. Therefore, the probability of lysing K is 4/40=0.1, which is 10%. Similarly, lysing B is 100%.\n\nBut lysing B is only possible if the lysogenic phage has the mutation in rII, which it does. Lysing K would require another mutation, but in this case, the problem states that the lysogenic phage can only lyse B, implying that lysing K isn't happening. So",

But then why would the presence of both cause half to lyse more than the other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two mutantphages are from different sources, each having a mutation in region II (rII). One phage causes B to lyse, the other causes K to lyse. But then, when both are present, perhaps their mutations interfere, leading to increased activity, thus more infections. But in the experiment, when both are present, half of the population (from the first half, which is low density) shows more infections on K. So perhaps the combination of the two mutations increases the probability of infection on K compared to B.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcome. Without any mutation, all phages would be wild-type, and presumably, they don't lyse either B or K. However, in this case, when both mutantphages are present, the interactions occur. The presence of both types might lead to some sort of recombination, where the mutations influence each other's activity. \n\nThe key here is that the recombination rate determines how likely the two mutations are to affect each other. If the mutations are independent, the probability of a successful interaction is p * q, where p is the frequency of the first mutation and q is the frequency of the second. However, in this case, since both are present, we're dealing with a situation where the phages are present together, and their combined effect is observed.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on K is much higher than on B. Specifically, 4 vs. 40. Given that the first half (plated at 1e7) has fewer cells, the chance of infection is low, but the second half (plated at 1e5) has more cells, so higher chance. But the higher chance on K indicates that more of the phages are causing infections on K than on B. So the majority of the plasmids are responsible for K's lyses, implying that the recombination causes the lysogenic phages to be more active on K.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (p + q - pq) / 1\n\nBut wait, recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of recombinant chromosomes. Alternatively, using the chi-squared test for linkage disequilibrium, we can estimate the recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on K is 4 and on B is 40, and considering the dilution factors, we can calculate the probabilities of each strain being infected. Assuming that each plume represents an independent event, the probability of K being infected is proportional to the number of plumes and the dilution factor.\n\nFor the K half:\n- Dilution factor: 1e5\n- Number of plumes: 4\nSo the probability of K being infected is 4 * 1e5 / total cells in that well.\nSimilarly, for B:\n- Dilution factor: 1e7\n- Number of plumes: 40\nProbability of B being infected: 40 * 1e7 / total cells.\n\nBut since the total cells aren't given, we can assume equal dilution factors relative to the plume count. Therefore, the ratio of plumes reflects the ratio of probabilities.\n\nThus, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the probability of K being infected is 1/10th that of B. Let's denote the probability of a single phage causing K to lyse as P_K and similarly P_B for B. Since the phages are being plated together, the occurrence of multiple plumes is dependent on the recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the probability of both occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities minus the recombination frequency times their product.\n\nAssuming independence (for simplicity), P_K * P_B = 1/10.\n\nWe need to find the recombination frequency (R), which is the measure of how often the two mutations interact. Using the formula:\n\nP_K * P_B = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct formula for linkage disequilibrium is:\n\nP_{K,B} = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nWhere P_{K,B} is the probability of both events happening together, which in our case is the probability of K being infected and B being infected.\n\nBut in reality, the occurrence of both events (K and B being infected) depends on whether they are linked or not. If they are unlinked (no recombination), then P_K * P_B is the probability of both events happening independently. However, if they are linked, the occurrence is influenced by recombination.\n\nActually, the formula for the probability of both K and B being infected is:\n\nP_{K,B} = P_K * P_B * (1 - R)\n\nBecause the presence of one affects the probability of the other.\n\nBut in our case, the observed probability is that the chance of K being infected is 1/10th that of B. So,\n\n( P_K * P_B ) * (1 - R) = P_K * P_B / 10\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(1 - R) = 1/10\n\nTherefore, R = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 = 90%\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options provided. The options go up to 0.5%. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps I misunderstood the relationship between plumes and probabilities. Each plume represents a successful infection event. The number of plumes on each strain is proportional to the number of phages present and their ability to infect. Since the first half (plated at 1e7) has fewer cells, the chance of infection is lower, but the second half (plated at 1e5) has more cells, so higher chance.\n\nBut the exact calculation depends on the actual number of plumes and the dilution factors. Let's define:\n\nFor the K half:\nNumber of plumes = 4\nDilution factor = 1e5\nTotal cells in well = 4 * 1e5 = 4e5\n\nFor the B half:\nNumber of plumes = 40\nDilution factor = 1e7\nTotal cells in well = 40 * 1e7 = 4e8\n\nThe probability of K being infected is 4e5 / 4e8 = 1/1000\n\nSimilarly, the probability of B being infected is 4e8 / 4e8 = 1\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no\u2014if you plate more cells, you get more chances for the phage to infect. So if you plate at a lower dilution factor (more cells), the chance of infection is higher, hence more plumes.\n\nBut the issue is that the number of plumes is directly proportional to the number of phages times their success probability. However, in reality, the phage's success is also influenced by recombination. If the mutations are linked, the combined effect can increase the probability of both events happening.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plumes. Normally, if the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be (probability of K) * (probability of B). However, if there's recombination, the effective probability changes.\n\nAlternatively, the formula used in genetic association studies for detecting recombination is:\n\nChi-square statistic = (O - E)^2 / E\n\nWhere O is the observed number of cases, and E is the expected under independence.\n\nHere, O_K = 4, O_B = 40\n\nUnder independence, the expected number of K plumes would be (number of plumes on B) * (probability of K)\n\nSince the total number of plumes across both halves is 44, the proportion of plumes on B is 40/44 \u2248 0.909. Therefore, the expected number of K plumes under independence would be approximately 0.909 * 4 \u2248 3.64.\n\nThe observed is 4, which is slightly higher than expected. Similarly, the expected number of B plumes under independence would be around 4.\n\nCalculating the Chi-square statistic:\n\n(O_K - E_K)^2 / E_K = (4 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 (0.36)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 0.1296 / 3.64 \u2248 0.0355\n\n(O_B - E_B)^2 / E_B = (40 - 4)^2 / 4 = (36)^2 / 4 = 1296 / 4 = 324\n\nAdding these gives a large Chi-square value, suggesting significant deviation from independence. To determine the recombination frequency, we can compute the likelihood of observing these numbers under varying levels of recombination.\n\nHowever, this approach might be more involved than necessary. Let me try to simplify. If the two mutations are completely independent, the expected number of K plumes would be (prob of K) * (total plumes). From earlier, prob of K is 4/(4+40)=4/44\u22480.0909. Total plumes=44. So expected K plumes=0.0909*44\u22484, which matches the observed. Similarly, expected B plumes=40. So under independence, the observed matches perfectly. Thus, recombination must be zero, which contradicts the experiment where more K plumes are observed.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the two mutations are independent, the observed number of plumes should match expectations. But the problem says that the number of plumes on K is significantly higher than on B. So there must be some recombination making the lysogenic phages more effective on K.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phages are causing both B and K to lyse, but the ones carrying the mutation in rII cause B to lyse. If the other mutation allows the phages to lyse K, then when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phages can cause both B and K to lyse, leading to more infections. However, in the experiment, only B lyse, so perhaps the other mutation is not affecting K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two mutantphages are actually the same, and the difference lies in their origin. But that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the probability of K being infected is 1/10 that of B. If the mutations were independent, the probability of K being infected would be (prob of lysogenic phage) * (prob of lysogenic phage in region II). Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q as the frequency of the mutation in region II. Then, the probability of lysing B is p*q, and the probability of lysing K is p*r, where r is the frequency of the mutation in region II affecting K.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage carries the mutation in rII, it can lyse B but not K. So p*q is non-zero, but p*r is zero. Wait, that would imply that the mutation in region II is lethal when acting on lysogenic phages, but when acting on phages that already have the lysogenic mutation, it's beneficial. Wait, no\u2014probably the opposite: lysogenic phages require the mutation in rII to lyse. So if a lysogenic phage lacks the mutation in rII, it cannot lyse, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the fact that the number of plumes on K is 1/10th that on B. Assuming that the mutations are independent, the expected number of K plumes would be (p_K) * N, where p_K is the probability of lysing K, and N is the total number of phages. Similarly, the expected number of B plumes would be (p_B) * N. Here, p_B is the probability of lysing B, which is 1 (since lysogenic phages carry the mutation in rII and can lyse B). Therefore, p_B = 1, and p_K is less than 1 because lysogenic phages do not lyse K. But in reality, the lysogenic phages can still lyse K if the mutation in rII is present but acts differently, but I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutantphages creates some form of interference or competition, but I'm not sure. Another way is to realize that when both mutations are present, the probability of a successful interaction is higher, leading to more plumes on the side where the mutation is in rII.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5% because the observed ratio suggests that the recombination frequency is low. Alternatively, D, 0.02%, or F, 0.3%.\n\nWait, going back to the initial idea of calculating the recombination frequency using the Chi-square method. If the observed number of K plumes is significantly higher than expected under independence, the recombination frequency would be high. However, in this case, it's the opposite\u2014it's lower on K than expected. Wait, no, the observed number on K is higher, so the probability of lysing K is lower than expected.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall that in genetic association, when you have two mutations that tend to function together, you can detect a positive association. The formula for determining the significance of the association is similar to Chi-square tests. The expected number of K plumes under independence would be based on the frequencies of the mutations.\n\nSuppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage is p, and the frequency of the mutation in rII is q. If the mutations are independent, the probability of lysing K is p*(1-q), assuming lysing B requires the mutation. Wait, no\u2014because lysing B requires the mutation in rII, and lysing K requires another mutation in rII. So the probability of lysing K would be q, and lysing B would be p*q. But since lysing B is not happening, p*q = 0. Therefore, either p=0 or q=0. But p can't be zero because lysogenic phages exist. Therefore, q must be zero, meaning that lysing K is impossible, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is simpler. The ratio of plumes is 1:10, so the probability of lysing K is 1/10th that of lysing B. Assuming that the probabilities are independent, the expected number of lysing K plumes would be (1/10)*N, where N is the total number of phages. The observed is 4, so N=40. Therefore, the probability of lysing K is 4/40=0.1, which is 10%. Similarly, lysing B is 100%.\n\nBut lysing B is only possible if the lysogenic phage has the mutation in rII, which it does. Lysing K would require another mutation, but in this case, the problem states that the lysogenic phage can only lyse B, implying that lysing K isn't happening. So",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

On the B side, only 4 plumes (so 4 colonies) grew, while on the K side, there were 40 plumes. That seems like a lot higher on the K side. Hmm, wait, no, because the K side was plated at a lower dilution factor, meaning more cells are plated, so more potential infections. But if the two types cause different outcomes, maybe their combinations lead to either increased or decreased susceptibility. However, since the lysogenic phage isn't present in the B group, perhaps the combination leads to more lysogenic activity? Or maybe the presence of lysogenic phages makes the lysogenic phage itself more likely to cause problems. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage and the wild-type phage interact in a way that increases the rate of lysogeny. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the experiment has two main steps:\n1. The initial plates where E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutants. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, we expect more infections on the B half.\n2. Then, those plasmids are split further: half is placed on strain B's lawn, and the other half is placed on strain K's lawn. The results show that on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes grow, while on strain K's lawn, 40 plumes grow.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the half from strain B is placed on strain B's lawn, and the other half is placed on strain K's lawn, then on strain B's lawn, all the plumes should be from the B half. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, all the plumes should be from the K half. But according to the results, only 4 plumes appeared on strain B's lawn and 40 on strain K's. That would suggest that the B half has fewer plumes than expected, implying more susceptibility or less susceptibility. Similarly, the K half had more plumes than expected, indicating higher susceptibility. This might indicate that the B half has been combined with something else, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutant types affects the growth differently. Maybe the combination of lysogenic and wild-type phages leads to increased lysogeny or resistance. For example, when the lysogenic phage is present along with wild-type, the lysogenic may integrate better, leading to more infections. But I'm not entirely certain.\n\nAnother angle is considering the concept of recombinant phages. Recombination refers to the process by which genetic material from two different sources combines to produce new phages. In this case, the two mutants must have recombined during replication or integration. The number of plumes could give an indication of whether the phages integrated or just combined.\n\nBut I'm still a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If the lysogenic phage integrates with the wild-type, the lysogenic phage becomes more prevalent, leading to more infections. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage integrates with another type, it might affect the overall outcome. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't present in strain B's initial infection, so maybe the combination leads to more lysogenic activity or reduced susceptibility.\n\nThe key here is determining the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Recombination frequency typically ranges between 0% and 100%, indicating how often the genetic material from two different sources combines. It's usually measured as the percentage of gametes that carry both mutations, assuming they came from a single parent. But sometimes, it's expressed as the percentage of gametes carrying one mutation given the presence of another.\n\nIn this context, the experiment's results can help us determine how many times the two mutations combined during replication. The higher the number of plumes on strain K (which received the lysogenic phage), it suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated successfully into the phage DNA, making it more likely to replicate within the host. Alternatively, if there was recombination, the number of plumes might correlate with the degree of integration.\n\nHowever, I'm still unclear on exactly how to calculate the recombination frequency from the number of plumes observed. Perhaps the difference in the number of plumes on the two strains can indicate the level of recombination. For instance, if recombination occurs frequently, the lysogenic phage might integrate more readily, leading to more plumes on the strain where the lysogenic phage was used.\n\nGiven that, maybe the recombination frequency is high enough that the lysogenic phage integrates once, leading to more plumes on strain K.

Given that the results showed a significant increase in plumes on strain K, it suggests a moderate to high level of recombination. Among the options, H is 5%, which seems plausible. However, I'm not entirely confident. Other options like G (0.5%) or F (0.3%) also seem reasonable depending on how precise the measurement is.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D (0.1%) or J (0.05%), but I'm leaning towards C (1.5%) because a higher recombination frequency would result in more plumes. Alternatively, maybe it's H (5%) due to the significant increase.\n\nBut I'm still uncertain. To proceed, I'll consider that the recombination frequency is related to the number of plumes.

Therefore, I'll go with option G (0.5%) or H (5%). Wait, no\u2014the options include numbers like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 5%.\n\nActually, the correct approach might involve calculating the number of recombinant plasmids and using a formula to estimate the recombination frequency. However, without specific calculations, it's hard to apply a formula directly. Alternatively, the difference in plume counts could hint at the proportion of successful recombination events.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage DNA, it would replicate more effectively, causing more plumes on strain K. The initial half was placed on strain B's lawn, expecting fewer plumes because strain B's strain wasn't lysogenic. But the result shows 4 plumes on strain B and 40 on strain K. This discrepancy suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated successfully into the phage DNA, leading to more plumes on strain K.\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is 'p', the expected number of recombinant plasmids would relate to p. However, without knowing the total number of plasmids, it's difficult to compute p. But among the options, 1.5% (option C) seems close to the likelihood of significant recombination leading to more plumes on strain K.\n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that the recombination frequency is approximately 1.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Alternatively, the difference in plume counts could hint at the proportion of successful recombination events.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage DNA, it would replicate more effectively, causing more plumes on strain K. The initial half was placed on strain B's lawn, expecting fewer plumes because strain B's strain wasn't lysogenic. But the result shows 4 plumes on strain B and 40 on strain K. This discrepancy suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated successfully into the phage DNA, leading to more plumes on strain K.\n\nAssuming that the probability of recombination is 'p', the expected number of recombinant plasmids would relate to p. However, without knowing the total number of plasmids, it's difficult to compute p. But among the options, 1.5% (option C) seems close to the likelihood of significant recombination leading to more plumes on strain K.\n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that the recombination frequency is approximately 1.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them.

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Specifically, 40 vs. 4. That seems like a big difference. If only the lysogenic phage was present, we would expect more plumes on strain B since it's the same type. But here, even though both are present, more plumes appear on strain K, suggesting that strain K might be carrying some variation due to the combination of the two mutants. Alternatively, maybe the recombination increases the efficiency of lysogeny, making it more effective against E. coli strain B. \n\nWait, no, the question says the lysogenic phage does something bad. So if both types are present, the lysogenic phages should still do the same thing as before, right? Unless the recombination changes their replication strategy. Perhaps the recombinant phages have a different way of replicating, allowing them to lyse the bacteria more effectively. So in the presence of both types, the lysogenic phages become more active, leading to more plumes on strain B, but perhaps another outcome is observed on strain K. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. \n\nIn the initial experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present, all the E. coli strain B would be affected because the lysogenic phage causes cell death. However, when both types are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the strain B, while the lysogenic wild type (which doesn't affect strain B) remains unaffected. But wait, the question says that half the cells are divided into two groups: one half is treated with 1:1e7 phage and another with 1:1e5. Then, these are plated on strain B and K respectively. The result showed 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the strain K has more successful infections compared to strain B. \n\nSo why would that happen? If only lysogenic phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B should be high because the lysogenic phages are the ones doing the damage. But when both types are present, the lysogenic phages take over, so the number of plumes on strain B should decrease compared to when only the lysogenic phage is present. However, in the given data, strain B shows 40 plumes, which is less than expected if only the lysogenic phage were present. Strain K, however, shows 4 plumes, which is much higher than normal. This discrepancy suggests that some of the lysogenic phages have taken over and caused more plumes on strain K, possibly due to recombination or increased activity. \n\nNow, to determine the recombination frequency, I think we need to look at how often the two mutation types interact. Recombination between two genes occurs at a certain rate, say R%, and the likelihood of crossing over is 50% of the time. The formula for calculating the number of recombinant chromosomes is 2nR, where n is the number of chromosomes. Here, we're dealing with a single gene locus, so n=1. Therefore, the number of recombinants would be 2R. But how does this relate to our problem?\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, if the recombination frequency is low (say 0.05%), then the probability of recombination between the two mutations is very low. This would mean that the two mutations don't interfere much, and the effect seen on strain K is primarily due to the recombination event. In such cases, the number of plumes would increase on one strain due to the recombined phage causing a different outcome, perhaps better or worse. \n\nGiven that 4 plumes appeared on strain K and 40 on B, which is four times as many, it suggests that the recombination occurred frequently enough to cause a significant increase in infections on one strain. To find the exact recombination frequency, we might use statistical methods based on the observed results. However, without specific formulas or tables, it's challenging to compute directly. \n\nBut looking at the options provided, the possible answers range from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the large discrepancy in plume numbers (4 vs. 40), the recombination must be quite frequent. The most likely scenario is that recombination occurs at a rate sufficient to explain the higher number of plumes on strain K. \n\nAmong the options, D is 0.05%, which is close to 0.1%, and F is 0.3%. Considering the logarithmic relationship between recombination rates and the likelihood of events, a rate of 0.05% would correspond to a small probability, which aligns with the high number of plumes on strain K. However, the exact calculation would require knowing the total number of potential crossover events. Without precise calculations, it's hard to pinpoint exactly, but among the options, D (0.05%) and F (0.3%) are plausible. \n\nSince the answer choices include multiple letters, and typically, in such questions, the correct answer is often one of the middle options, but sometimes the smallest makes sense.

Alternatively, if we consider that the number of plumes relates to the number of successful infections, and the plumes on K are 1/10th of those on B (since 40 vs. 4, which is roughly 10x), a higher recombination rate could lead to a proportional increase in infections on one strain. \n\nTherefore, after considering the experimental results and the role of recombination, I believe the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome is approximately 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So if strain B was primarily lysogenic, any mutation in its phages would lead to double mutants when mixed with lysogenic ones. However, in this case, strain B had both types of phages. Wait, actually, the problem states that strain B was primarily affected, meaning that perhaps most of the double mutants arose from mixing the two types.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The initial experiment shows that strain B is mostly affected when only lysogenic phages are present. Then, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is also affected, suggesting that at least one double mutant occurred. The second part plates the mixture on strain K. Since strain K is the lysogenic phage type, any double mutants would require one lysogenic and one non-lysogenic phage. However, in the first half, the phages were lysogenic, so they wouldn't interact with strain K's lysogenic phages. Therefore, any double mutants formed in the second half (on strain K) would indicate that one of the phages in the mix was lysogenic (from strain B) and the other was non-lysogenic (from strain B as well? Or wait, no\u2014strain B has two types: one causing lytic (non-lysis) and one causing lysogenic (no lytic). So when you mix these two, their DNA sequences could recombine, creating a new phage type. If one of those recombinant phages can integrate into the lysogenic phage (from strain K), then it would become a double mutant, which would appear as a plume on strain K's lawn.\n\nLooking back at the data: On strain K's lawn, four plumes appeared. That suggests four double mutants. These double mutants came from phages that integrated into the lysogenic phage (from strain B), which would mean that the lysogenic phage and the recombined phage are both present. Each such double mutant would cause less than normal lysis because the phage integrates into the lysogenic form, making it non-lytic. \n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is given by:\n\nrf = (number of double mutants) / (total number of potential double mutants)\n\nBut in reality, it's often approximated using the chi-squared test or the formula involving the number of plasmids. Alternatively, the recombination fraction can be calculated using the equation:\n\nrf = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. But since we're dealing with double mutants, another approach is to use the equation:\n\nrf = 1 - (plumes on K + plumes on B - double mutants) / total\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. The number of double mutants is expected if the two mutations are independent. Normally, if two mutations are independent, the probability of a double mutant would be p*q. But in reality, they might be dependent due to recombination.\n\nIn this experiment, the presence of both mutation types leads to double mutants, indicating that there's some recombination. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (CoC) is:\n\nCoC = (number of double mutants) / (expected number of double mutants)\n\nExpected number of double mutants = (frequency of mutation A) * (frequency of mutation B) * (total plasmids)^2\n\nAssuming equal frequencies for both mutations, and considering that each plasmid has two possible mutations, but in our case, the two mutations are different (one causing lysogenic, the other non-lytic), perhaps CoC is close to 1, meaning that the mutations are independent. However, in reality, they may be linked, leading to some CoC </think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nThe key here is the relationship between the recombination frequency and the observed number of double mutants. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two mutations. The more likely the recombination, the fewer double mutants should form because their genes would be in different orders. In a typical double mutant scenario without recombination, you'd expect each mutation to cause its own effect, but if they recombine, you might get a product where neither mutation is active, leading to no lytic or lysogenic fission (double mutants).\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutation types are present, the E. coli strain B has some double mutants.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations allows for some recombination, like switching from one type to another. \n\nThe key here is that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B shows a mix of effects\u2014only the lysogenic phage affects it, but when plated on strain K, the effect is different. So the difference in the number of plumes indicates whether the mutation recombined. If the mutations recombine, then when you plate on strain K, which has its own set of mutations, the combination might produce a new strain that's resistant to lysogeny or something similar. But wait, the initial problem says that only the lysogenic phage does damage. So if the mutations recombine, perhaps it leads to a mutation that doesn't cause damage in strain K, but that contradicts the given data because the result showed more plumes on strain K than expected. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me look at the numbers again. On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found. Strain K had 4 plumes. Normally, if only lysogenic phages are present, all cells would be lysed, leading to no infections, but since some cells are lysogenic, they'll lyse and die, while others are not, causing plumes. However, the presence of both mutant phages complicates things. The fact that only lysogenic phages affect strain B suggests that the lysogenic ones are dominant in their effect. When they're mixed with non-lysogenic ones, maybe the non-lysogenic ones take over, but the problem states that only lysogenic cause damage. So maybe the mixing doesn't change much except for the ratio of cells, but the main point is that the presence of both mutants allows for some combination that results in a different outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination refers to the ability of one mutation to switch to the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage takes over from the non-lysogenic one due to recombination, then on strain K, which may have a different mutation, this could lead to a new mutation that isn't as effective, thus resulting in fewer plumes. That makes sense because if the lysogenic phage takes over, it won't cause damage anymore, so fewer cells are lysed, leading to fewer plumes. In the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli on strain K shows fewer plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage took over, meaning that the original lysogenic phage's mutation must have recombined with the non-lysogenic mutation in strain K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is related to how often this happened.\n\nNow, the formula for recombinant DNA is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 2 * q * m\n\nWhere q is the frequency of one allele and m is the frequency of the other. But in terms of plasmid replication, we usually use the coefficient of coincidence (COI), which is the ratio of observed double crossovers to expected. COI is calculated as:\n\nCOI = observed / expected\n\nBut here, we're dealing with recombination frequencies directly. If the recombination frequency is r, then the probability of recombining is r/2. Alternatively, considering the plasmid replication, the expected number of recombinants depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes (infections) depends on the frequency of the mutated phages. Each plume corresponds to a single infection event. So the total number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells plated multiplied by the frequency of the mutation.\n\nFor strain B, the number of plumes is 40, and for strain K, it's 4. Assuming that both strains have been treated with the same amount of plating, the ratio of plumes would reflect the ratio of cell plating. But wait, the dilutions are different: 1e5 vs 1e7. So the concentration of phages is higher in the 1e5 group, meaning fewer cells are plated, hence fewer plumes. But in reality, the number of plumes also relates to the number of cells plus the efficiency of the phage lysis.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plumes can indicate the relative effectiveness of the phages in infecting the cells. If the recombination frequency is high, more of the lysogenic phage remains active, leading to more infections. Conversely, low recombination would mean less activity, fewer plumes. But since only lysogenic phages affect strain B, any recombination would likely lead to a loss of lysogenic activity, affecting strain K as well. Thus, the difference in plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage was either lost or partially retained.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is low, say 0%, then most of the lysogenic phage would remain active, leading to more plumes. If the recombination frequency is high, fewer lysogenic phages would remain, leading to fewer plumes. In our case, strain B shows more plumes (40) than strain K (4), suggesting that the lysogenic phage remained more active in strain B, implying lower recombination frequency. But we need to calculate the exact recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the dilution factors, the concentration of phages in the 1e5 group is higher, so fewer cells are plated, leading to fewer plumes. However, the actual number of plumes also depends on the efficiency of the phage lysis. The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor because fewer cells are plated, but more phages are present, increasing the chance of infection. However, the efficiency of phage lysis is constant across both groups, assuming the same conditions.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plumes should correspond to the ratio of the number of cells plated, adjusted for the dilution factors. For strain B, diluted at 1e7, so the number of cells per well is 1e7 * N, where N is the number of cells plated without the phage. Similarly, for strain K, 1e5 * N. The ratio of plumes would be (1e7)/(1e5) = 100 times higher for strain B, but we see only 4 vs 40 plumes. That discrepancy suggests that the actual number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, but the absolute number depends on the efficiency. However, since both experiments used the same efficiency, we can ignore it for now.\n\nSo, the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This ratio should correspond to the ratio of the number of cells plated, adjusted by the dilution factors. So,\n\n( (1e7 * N) ) / ( (1e5 * N) ) = 100 = 10:1 inverse? Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells plated, which is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, plumes_B / plumes_K = (1/dil_B) / (1/dil_K) = dil_K / dil_B = 1e7 / 1e5 = 100. But we have plumes_B = 40, plumes_K=4, so 40/4=10, which is half of 20 (which would be 100). This suggests that the actual plating efficiency is lower in the 1e5 group, but I don't know how to proceed with that information.\n\nPerhaps instead, the recombination frequency can be determined by comparing the expected number of plumes under normal and recombinant conditions. Under normal conditions, if there's no recombination, all lysogenic phages are functional, so the number of plumes would be higher than if some recombination occurred, reducing the number of active lysogenic phages. Therefore, the observed number of plumes can help estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula relating recombination frequency (r) to plume counts is:\n\nplume_count = (1 - r) / (1 + r)\n\nAssuming that under normal conditions, the plume count would be proportional to 1/(1 - r), but this might not be accurate. Alternatively, if recombination reduces the number of active phages, the plume count decreases. The exact relationship depends on the specifics of the experiment.\n\nGiven that we have two plume counts, 40 and 4, we can assume that the ratio reflects the recombination. Specifically, the proportion of cells that became recombined determines the ratio of plumes. If x% of the cells underwent recombination, then the plume count would decrease accordingly. However, calculating this exactly requires knowing the mathematical model behind the experiment, which might involve more detailed calculations beyond basic statistics.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the coefficient of coincidence. The COI is the ratio of observed double crossovers to expected. However, since we're dealing with recombination events, not double crossovers, this might not apply directly. Instead, the recombination frequency itself can be estimated using the ratio of plumes.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers range from 0.02% to 0.5%. To determine which one it is, I can consider typical values of recombination frequencies in bacterial phages. Recombination events in T_4 phages are known to occur frequently, but not always. For example, some studies show that T_4 phages undergo significant recombination within their genomes, especially when multiple mutations are present.\n\nGiven the experimental setup, where only lysogenic phages affect strain B, and fewer plumes on strain K, this suggests that the recombination frequency is relatively low because the lysogenic phage remains active more in strain B, implying that recombination didn't happen frequently enough to reduce the lysogenic activity in strain K. However, without precise calculation, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage.\n\nAmong the options, option D is 0.02%, which seems very low. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer to realistic levels of recombination. Given that the difference in plumes is quite significant (from 40 to 4), it's plausible that a moderate level of recombination exists. However, without further calculations, it's hard to decide between D and F. Given that the question asks for the \"amount\" of recombination, and considering that the answer choices are percentages, the correct choice is probably D (0.02%) or F (0.3%). Based on the reasoning that recombination occurs frequently enough to explain the higher plume count in strain B but not enough to drastically reduce the plume count in strain K, the more reasonable answer is F (0.3%).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that lower recombination would mean more plumes. If recombination is low, more lysogenic phages remain active, leading to more plumes. If recombination is high, fewer lysogenic phages remain, leading to fewer plumes. Here, strain B has more plumes (40 vs 4), which suggests lower recombination frequency. Therefore, the correct answer would be F (0.3%), indicating a moderate level of recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The number of plumes is proportional to the number of cells plated, which is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, plumes_B / plumes_K = (1/dil_B) / (1/dil_K) = dil_K / dil_B = 1e7 / 1e5 = 100. But we have plumes_B = 40, plumes_K=4, so 40/4=10, which is half of 20 (which would be 100).

The COI is the ratio of observed double crossovers to expected. However, since we're dealing with recombination events, not double crossovers, this might not apply directly. Instead, the recombination frequency itself can be estimated using the ratio of plumes.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the possible answers range from 0.02% to 0.5%. To determine which one it is, I can consider typical values of recombination frequencies in bacterial phages. Recombination events in T_4 phages are known to occur frequently, but not always. For example, some studies show that T_4 phages undergo significant recombination within their genomes, especially when multiple mutations are present.\n\nGiven the experimental setup, where only lysogenic phages affect strain B, and fewer plumes on strain K, this suggests that the recombination frequency is relatively low because the lysogenic phage remains active more in strain B, implying that recombination didn't happen frequently enough to reduce the lysogenic activity in strain K. However, without precise calculation, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage.\n\nAmong the options, option D is 0.02%, which seems very low. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer to realistic levels of recombination. Given that the difference in plumes is quite significant (from 40 to 4), it's plausible that a moderate level of recombination exists. However, without further calculations, it's hard to decide between D and F. Given that the question asks for the \"amount\" of recombination, and considering that the answer choices are percentages, the correct choice is probably D (0.02%) or F (0.3%). Based on the reasoning that recombination occurs frequently enough to explain the higher plume count in strain B but not enough to drastically reduce the plume count in strain K, the more reasonable answer is F (0.3%).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that lower recombination would mean more plumes. If recombination is low, more lysogenic phages remain active, leading to more plumes. If recombination is high, fewer lysogenic phages remain, leading to fewer plumes. Here, strain B has more plumes (40 vs 4), which suggests lower recombination frequency. Therefore, the correct answer would be F (0.3%), indicating a moderate level of recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

On the B side, 4 plumes are found, meaning 4 colonies form, while on the K side, 40 are found. Wait, no\u2014the total number of plumes isn't directly the count; each plume indicates an infection. So perhaps the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. If the initial population was split evenly, then on strain B's lawn, you'd expect about half the plumes to be from strain B, and similarly for strain K. But wait, the initial division might be different. Let me try again. The plate is split into two halves. Each half is then placed on a different strain's lawn. So suppose we had N phages initially. After splitting, we have N/2 on each half. Each half is then plated at different concentrations. On strain B's lawn, the N/2 phages are plated at a certain dilution, leading to some number of plumes. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, another N/2 phages are plated. The counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, but why would one strain have significantly fewer plumes than the other? Maybe because the phage that causes lysogeny is more effective at infecting the specific strain. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both types affects the lysogenic phages in a way that reduces their effectiveness. \n\nWait, considering the process: when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage may cause the phage DNA to integrate into the host genome, making it less susceptible to lytic replication. This could lead to a situation where the lysogenic phages are more likely to cause lysis rather than just lyse and replicate. However, in the given scenario, the lysogenic phage seems to cause lytic fission in strain B, whereas the lysogenic phage in strain K doesn't do that. Or maybe not\u2014since the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis in strain B but does in strain K. That\u2019s contradictory unless... Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, the problem says \"the lysogenic phage that carries mutations in rII can cause the lysis of strain B but not of strain K.\" Wait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because the lysogenic phage should affect both strains similarly, right? Unless one strain is better at integrating the phage DNA. But the question is about recombination, which refers to the exchange of genetic information between the phage and the host. Recombination typically occurs when two different genes exchange places, causing mutations in both. In this case, the two mutant types are carrying mutations in the same gene (T_4 genome), so they should recombine. The recombination fraction is usually calculated as the frequency of recombinant offspring, which depends on the percentage of recombinant gametes. Here, the key is determining how much of the T_4 genome has been exchanged between the two mutant phages.\n\nIn the experiment, the main point is whether the two mutants interact or recombine. Since the lysogenic phage in strain B doesn't cause lysis, but in strain K it does, this implies that the lysogenic phage in strain B cannot integrate into the host genome, while the one in strain K can. But since the T_4 genome is shared, recombination would occur if the two mutations are on the same chromosome and cause a break and rejoin, creating a new mutation. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage in strain B doesn't cause lysis, suggesting that it didn't recombine properly. Therefore, the two mutations must have recombined. The observed effect shows that only the lysogenic phage in strain K caused lysis, implying that the recombination occurred in strain K's phage but not in strain B's. Thus, the amount of recombination is determined by how much the two mutations are linked on the T_4 chromosome.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we consider the number of recombinant individuals over the total number of possible. In this case, the experiment is set up such that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. Strain B received 40 plumes, and strain K received 4. The ratio of 40:4 simplifies to 10:1, indicating that most of the phages successfully integrated into the host genome in strain B, and very few did so in strain K. This suggests a high degree of recombination because most of the phages integrated in strain B, meaning the two mutations are far apart, and very few integrated in strain K, meaning the two mutations are close together.\n\nThe recombination frequency (RF) is often expressed as the percentage of recombinant individuals. Since strain B showed 40 plumes and strain K showed 4, the majority (96%) were recombinants in strain B, and only 4% were in strain K. This indicates that the two mutations are tightly linked (low RF) because only a small fraction (about 4%) recombine, leading to non-integrable mutations. To find the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of Non-Recombinant / Total)\n\nBut here, the number of non-recombinants is 4, and the total is 4 + 40 = 44. So,\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (4/44) \u2248 1 - 0.0909 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. Wait, but this contradicts my earlier thought because if the RF is 90%, that would imply that almost all phages integrated, meaning low recombination. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, which is typically measured as the percentage of the time they recombine during gamete formation. The standard approach is to express the percentage of recombinant gametes. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as the percentage of recombinant progeny. In this case, strain B has 40 plumes, which are recombinants, and strain K has 4, which are non-recombining. So the number of recombinants is 40, and the total is 44. So the percentage of recombinants is (40/44)*100 \u2248 90.9%. But the question asks for the amount of recombination, which is typically expressed as the percentage of the time the two mutations recombine. However, in this context, it's more about the percentage of the time the mutations are lost together, i.e., the percentage of the time the phages don't integrate. Alternatively, the percentage of the time the phages recombine is the percentage of the time they lose function together, which is the same as the number of non-recombinants divided by the total.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. Recombination frequency is the proportion of chromosomes where the two genes are lost together. It is calculated as the number of recombinant individuals divided by the total number of individuals. In this case, strain B has 40 recombinants, and strain K has 4 non-recombinants, totaling 44. So the recombination frequency is 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. However, this seems too high because the question provides options in the range of 0.1% to 0.5%. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the experiment. The phages are mixed, so the order matters. If the lysogenic phage from strain B doesn't cause lysis, it might indicate that it didn't recombine, while the one from strain K did recombine, causing lysis. Therefore, the two mutations must have recombined in strain K but not in strain B. The recombination frequency is the percentage of times the two mutations recombine. Given that only 4 plumes were found in strain K, which is much lower than the 40 in strain B, this suggests a high degree of recombination because only 4% of the phages integrated into the host genome in strain K, meaning the two mutations are tightly linked. Conversely, in strain B, 96% of the phages integrated, meaning minimal recombination. \n\nThe recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of the time the two mutations are lost together. In this case, the percentage of recombinants is (number of recombinants)/(total) \u00d7 100. So 40/(40+4)=40/44\u224890.9%, but the answer choices are much smaller, like 0.1-0.5 percent. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the results. Perhaps the numbers represent something else, like the loss of function. Alternatively, the experiment measures the number of recombinants versus non-recombinants, but perhaps the actual calculation is different.\n\nWait, another approach: if the two mutations are on the same chromosome, and one is lost before the other, that would correspond to a high recombination frequency. However, in this case, only 4 plumes in strain K suggest that 4% of the phages have integrated, meaning the two mutations are tightly linked. The percentage of recombination is thus (number of recombinant events)/(total events) \u00d7 100. So 40/(40+4)=90.9%, but the answer options are around 0.1-0.5 percent. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the correct interpretation is that the number of plumes reflects the number of non-recombinant events. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is of non-recombinants to recombinants. So 4 non-recombinants vs 40 recombinants, giving a ratio of 1:10, which is approximately 10%, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the time the two mutations are lost together, which would be the number of recombinants divided by the total multiplied by 100. That gives 90.9%, which still doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nGiven that the options are much lower, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the probability that a random pair of mutations is a recombination, which is typically calculated using the formula:\n\nProbability = 1 - (1 - p)^n\n\nWhere p is the probability of recombination for each mutation, and n is the number of copies. However, without knowing p or n, this might not apply. Alternatively, the recombination frequency is often approximated as the percentage of recombinant individuals divided by the total, which we've already established is 90.9%.\n\nSince none of the options match this, perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the numbers represent the number of plumes, which correspond to the number of successful infections. If strain B received 40 plumes and strain K received 4, the difference in plumes suggests that strain B's phages integrated more, meaning the mutations are farther apart, requiring more chromosomal structure for recombination. Conversely, strain K's low integration rate suggests tight linkage. The percentage of recombination would then depend on how much the two mutations interfere during recombination. However, without further details, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact value.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the number of plumes. With strain B having 40 plumes and strain K having 4, the recombination frequency is approximately 4/44=0.0909 or 9.09%, which is still not matching any of the options. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination, which is typically expressed as a percentage, but the options are in percentages, not fractions. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is closest to option F (0.3 percent), assuming that the high number of non-recombinants (strain K) indicates a moderate level of recombination. Alternatively, if the correct calculation leads to a very low recombination frequency, the answer would be D (0.1 percent).\n\nBut I'm stuck because my calculations keep pointing towards 90.9%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me read the experiment again. Two types of mutantphages: one causes lysis in strain B but not in K. They mix and divide, with half on strain B and half on K. On B, 4 plumes, on K, 40. So 40 vs 4. If only 4 integrate, the rest are non-integrating. This suggests that the two mutations are tightly linked because only a small fraction integrates. Recombination frequency is the percentage of times the two mutations are lost together, which would be the number of recombinants (40) over total (44) times 100, which is approximately 90.9%. Again, this doesn't match the options. Maybe the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 4/44=0.0909 or 9.1%, which rounds to 9%, but this isn't an option either.\n\nLooking back at the options, the highest is G (0.5%), then F (0.3%), etc. None of them reach 9%. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of plumes reflects the number of successful interactions. If strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, the ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This indicates that the two mutations are highly linked, requiring extensive recombination to lose both functions. The percentage of recombination is thus approximately 90.9%, which is not among the options. However, since the options are much lower, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is around 0.05 percent (option J), thinking that 40 plumes and 4 are indicative of a rare recombination event. Alternatively, if the correct calculation yields a lower percentage, the answer would be closer to 0.1 percent (option D).\n\nAfter struggling through this, I think the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.05 percent, corresponding to option J. However, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, given the high number of non-recombinants in strain K, the answer might be around 0.02 percent (option I), considering the tiny number of recombinants compared to the total.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

However, since the options are much lower, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is around 0.05 percent (option J), thinking that 40 plumes and 4 are indicative of a rare recombination event. Alternatively, if the correct calculation yields a lower percentage, the answer would be closer to 0.1 percent (option D).\n\nAfter struggling through this, I think the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.05 percent, corresponding to option J. However, I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phages have a certain type of mutation that causes interference with their own activity, thereby affecting the lysogenic activity of the other mutation.\n\nWait, another angle: the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage (which affects strain B) is not as effective against itself as the lysogenic phage without any mutation. Because when they're both present, the lysogenic phage on strain B isn't causing as much damage as before. So perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes its activity less efficient when it's already lysogenic. This could lead to reduced activity when the same phage is used on another strain, like K.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination would occur if the two mutations interact, leading to a new variant. If the phages have a mutation that prevents the lysogenic activity from being active again, that would cause a reduction in the lysogenic phage's efficacy against strain B. Since only 4 out of 40 are seen on K, this suggests that the lysogenic phages from strain B are not as effective on K, possibly due to a recombined variant where their activity is reduced.\n\nIn molecular biology, recombination between two genes often leads to a decrease in the product of those genes. In phages, recombination would mean that the lysogenic and lytic parts interfere, making the lysogenic phage less effective at replicating or lysing. The percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of recombinant phages / Total number of phages) * 100\n\nBut wait, in this case, we don't directly know the number of recombinants. However, the ratio of plumes can give us an idea. The number of plumes on each strain depends on the relative concentrations of the phages. Strain B had 4 plumes, and strain K had 40. Since the dilutions were different (1e7 vs 1e5), the actual numbers of phages on each well differ. \n\nLet me denote:\n- P_B = Number of phages on strain B's wells\n- P_K = Number of phages on strain K's wells\n\nFrom the dilution, we can say that P_B \u2248 (Total cells) / 1e7 and P_K \u2248 (Total cells) / 1e5. Assuming the same total number of cells in each well, P_K is 10 times P_B.\n\nNow, the number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages that successfully infect the cells. Since only a few phages (4) caused problems on B and many (40) on K, the number of successful infections is lower on B than expected. This suggests that the lysogenic phages on B are less effective on themselves compared to when they are used on K.\n\nIf the two mutations recombine, the lysogenic phage on B would have a reduced activity when replicating, meaning it would not lyse the bacterium effectively. Therefore, the lysogenic phage on B would replicate and die more easily, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, when used on K, which likely has a different mutation (or no mutation), the lysogenic phage would function better, resulting in more plumes.\n\nTo estimate the percentage of recombination, we can use the ratio of the number of plumes. The expected ratio without recombination would be equal to the ratio of the original phage concentrations. If recombination occurs, the observed ratio changes.\n\nWithout recombination:\n- All lysogenic phages on B should replicate and lyse, producing plumes.\n- But due to recombination, some lysogenic phages on B lose activity, so fewer plumes are produced.\n\nWith recombination:\n- Some lysogenic phages on B do not lyse efficiently, so fewer plumes are produced.\n- On K, since the lysogenic phages have been modified (due to recombination), they are more effective, producing more plumes.\n\nSo the ratio of plumes (B to K) would be less than expected if there was no recombination. Without recombination, the number of plumes on B would be equal to the number on K. With recombination, B would have fewer plumes than K.\n\nGiven that on B, we have 4 plumes and on K, 40, the ratio is 1:10. If we assume that without recombination, the ratio would be 1:1, then the fact that it's 1:10 indicates some loss of efficiency due to recombination. To find the percentage of recombination, we can model the expected change.\n\nAssuming the original ratio is R = 1 (equal plumes on B and K), and with recombination, the ratio becomes R' = 4/40 = 0.1. Using the approximation that the change in log(R) is approximately equal to twice the recombination frequency (since recombination decreases the probability of replication and death, thus decreasing the rate of plasmid production).\n\nUsing the formula:\nlog(R') - log(R) \u2248 -2 * RF\n\nWhere RF is the recombination frequency (as a decimal).\n\nHere, log(0.1) - log(1) = -2.3026 \u2248 -2 * RF\n-2.3026 \u2248 -2RF\nRF \u2248 1.1513%\n\nThis is close to 1%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAlternatively, using a simpler approach:\nThe number of successful platings on B is 4, on K 40. The expected number under no recombination would be similar, but here B has significantly fewer. This suggests that recombination decreased the activity of the lysogenic phage on B, making it less effective. Thus, the percentage of recombination is around 1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "rollout": " Since only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission, the lysogenic ones should be the ones that lyse the E. coli, right? So the lysogenic phage would lyse the cells, causing the colonies to die. But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, making the E. coli lyse and die, while the wild-type phage (if any) might cause lysogenic fission, meaning it doesn't lyse the cell but lives longer. However, the question mentions \"mutantphages\" specifically\u2014so perhaps we're dealing with two different mutants within T_4, one causing lysogenic activity and the other causing lytic activity.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutants leads to a certain outcome. Normally, without any combination, you'd expect only one type of infection. But here, both are present, and the result is that half the population dies, as shown by the saturation being split equally between the two treatments. Wait, no\u2014the description says that the saturation is divided in half, half on B, half on K. Then, when the half on B is further diluted 1:1e7 and plated on B's lawn, 4 plumes appear. Similarly, the half on K is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. Hmm, that seems odd. Typically, if the same bacterium is used, the number of plumes would correlate based on the mutation rates. But here, the counts don't seem proportional. Maybe the dilution factors are important. For example, if the concentration of phages is such that the same number of plumes form on both plates, then the ratio of plumes would depend on the relative concentrations of the phages.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In a typical scenario where only one mutation exists, the number of plumes on each plate depends on the mutation rate and the dilution factor. If you dilute the phages more (lower dilution factor), the chance of infection increases, leading to more plumes. Conversely, a higher dilution factor reduces the chance of infection, resulting in fewer plumes. So in this case, the half that was treated with 1:1e7 phages was plated on strain B's lawn, and 4 plumes appeared. The other half, treated with 1:1e5 phages, was plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. That seems like a big difference\u2014only four vs. forty. That doesn't quite make sense unless the mutation rates are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed number of plumes relates to the product of the recombination frequency and the mutation rates. Recombination frequency (rf) is the percentage of double-stranded DNA regions where the two mutations are located. It ranges from 0% (no recombination) to 100% (complete recombination).\n\nThe formula to relate the number of plumes observed (N) is N = (f * (m1 + m2 - f)), where m1 and m2 are the mutation frequencies at each locus, and f is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, another approach is considering that when two mutations occur together, their combined effect affects the growth of the bacteria. In phage experiments, the number of plumes formed can indicate whether the mutations interfere or enhance each other.\n\nBut given the specific numbers provided: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, I suspect that the actual relationship isn't straightforward. Perhaps the correct way is to calculate the expected number of plumes based on the mutation frequencies and the recombination frequency. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Let\u2019s denote the mutation frequencies at each locus as m1 and m2.\n2. The recombination frequency is f.\n3. The total number of possible combinations is 4 (since each mutation can either be present or absent, but with recombination).\n4. Each combination has a probability of occurring, depending on f.\n5. The number of plumes observed on each plate depends on the product of the mutation frequency and the probability of the combination.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, the results aren't matching expectations. Normally, if only one mutation is present, you\u2019d see a certain number of plumes. Here, the presence of two mutations complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the experiment uses a dilution factor to control the density of phages in the solution. Higher dilution factor means fewer cells are exposed to each phage, reducing the chance of infection. So, if the phages are too concentrated, you get fewer plumes. Conversely, diluting them less (lower factor) gives more exposure, thus more plumes.\n\nSo, treating the half with 1:1e7 phages would lead to a higher chance of infection than the half with 1:1e5 phages. Therefore, on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes (from 1:1e7) versus 40 plumes (from 1:1e5). This suggests that the number of plumes decreases as the dilution factor increases, which makes sense because higher dilution factor means fewer cells, hence lower chance of infection.\n\nNow, thinking about the mathematical model: the number of plumes N is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor D, assuming Poisson statistics. So N ~ sqrt(D). Therefore, the ratio of plumes would be sqrt(1e7 / 1e5) = sqrt(100) = 10. But in our case, N_B = 4 and N_K = 40. Wait, that doesn\u2019t align directly because the plumes are on separate plates. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of plumes on each plate reflects the product of the mutation probabilities and the recombination frequency. Suppose the number of plumes N is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f), where m1 and m2 are the mutation probabilities, and f is the recombination frequency. But since both mutations are present, the effective mutation rate is (m1 + m2 - f), because some double-strand breaks cancel each other out due to recombination.\n\nGiven that, if both mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (m1 + m2 - f). However, in reality, the observed plumes may vary based on the exact distribution.\n\nBut perhaps the key lies in calculating the expected number of plumes under different conditions. Let's assume that each mutation occurs independently with certain probabilities. Let\u2019s say m1 is the probability of the first mutation (lytic phage), and m2 is the probability of the second mutation (lysozyme phage). The recombination frequency f tells us how often these mutations are together.\n\nIf both mutations happen together, the combined mutation rate would be (m1 + m2 - f), accounting for the fact that when both occur, they cancel each other due to recombination.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f), we can set up equations based on the observed plumes.\n\nWhen the half is treated with 1:1e7 phages, it was plated on strain B's lawn. On strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, so m1 would be high, and m2 might be low or zero. Conversely, when treated with 1:1e5 phages, it was plated on strain K's lawn, where perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, so m2 is high, and m1 might be low or zero.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- D1 = 1e7 (dilution factor)\n- D2 = 1e5\n- Plumes on B = 4\n- Plumes on K = 40\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f) multiplied by the dilution factor raised to some power. Let's hypothesize that N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f) * sqrt(D). So, for each treatment, N is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f) times the square root of D.\n\nThus, for D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nTaking the ratio N2/N1 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316.\n\nFrom the data, N2/N1 = 40/4 = 10.\n\nSetting 10 = 0.316*k, which implies k\u224831.6. But since k cancels out, it shows that the ratio holds true regardless of k.\n\nThis indicates that the expression N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D) is consistent with the observed plumes.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values. We know that on the B plate, D1=1e7, N1=4, and on the K plate, D2=1e5, N2=40.\n\nWe can write:\n\n4 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7) --> Equation 1\n40 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5) --> Equation 2\n\nDividing Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n\n40/4 = [k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)]/[k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)]\n\nSimplify:\n\n10 = sqrt(1e5 / 1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316\n\nWait, this doesn't add up because 10 \u2260 0.316. That must mean my initial assumption about the dependence on D is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the dependence is linear rather than involving square roots. Let me try again. Assume N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)*D.\n\nThen,\n\nFor D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*1e7\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*1e5\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nN2/N1 = (1e5)/(1e7) = 0.1\n\nBut in reality, N2/N1 = 10, so 0.1 \u2260 10. Hence, this model also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the relationship is inverse. Let's suppose N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)/D.\n\nThen,\n\nFor D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)/1e7\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)/1e5\n\nRatio N2/N1 = (1e5)/(1e7) = 0.01\n\nAgain, not matching 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps N \u221d sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D).\n\nThen,\n\nN1 = k*sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nN2 = k*sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nRatio N2/N1 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316, still not 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D). Let's test that.\n\nEquation 1: 4 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nEquation 2: 40 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nDivide Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n\n40/4 = [k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)]/[k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)]\nWhich simplifies to:\n10 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316\n\nBut 10 \u2248 0.316, which is false. Thus, this model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Instead of trying to model the expectation, maybe I should use the observed numbers to solve for the recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose that the presence of two mutations causes interference in their effects, leading to fewer plumes compared to when only one mutation is present. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the observed number of plumes could reflect the effectiveness of each mutation on the phage's ability to infect. If both mutations are present, they might reduce the number of successful infections, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes is higher on K (40) than on B (4). On K, presumably, the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, so m2 is high. On B, the lysogenic phage did cause issues, so m1 is high.\n\nSo, treating with 1:1e5 phages on B (which is K's lawn) resulted in 4 plumes, whereas treating with 1:1e7 phages on K's lawn (which is strain B's lawn) resulted in 40 plumes. This suggests that the higher dilution factor (1:1e7) on B led to more plumes, implying that strain B had a lower mutation rate at its locus.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both mutations are present, their presence should increase the chance of infection. So why are there more plumes on B?\n\nAh, perhaps because on B's lawn, the treatment with 1:1e7 phages is more likely to expose the lysogenic phage, causing more plumes. But on K's lawn, the treatment with 1:1e5 phages is more likely to expose the wild-type phage, which didn't cause issues, leading to fewer plumes. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the result after division and plating was half on B and half on K. Then, the half on B was treated with 1:1e7 phages, and the half on K with 1:1e5 phages.\n\nSo, for the B half: 1:1e7 phages treated, which would be more concentrated, exposing more cells and potentially more phages, leading to more infections, more plumes.\n\nFor the K half: 1:1e5 phages treated, which is less concentrated, exposing fewer cells and phages, leading to fewer infections, fewer plumes.\n\nBut according to the results, there were 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. That suggests that the B half had more plumes, which contradicts the expectation if the lysogenic phage caused issues. Unless, in reality, the presence of both mutations doesn't always cause the lysogenic phage to lyse, but sometimes the phage doesn't lyse despite having the mutation.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the lysogenic phage does cause lytic fission, leading to death of the E. coli. So, if the lysogenic phage is present, it should lyse the bacteria, causing them to die. Therefore, the presence of a lysogenic phage should lead to more plumes, as each phage would cause a single infection, leading to multiple plumes. \n\nBut according to the results, the B half (treated with 1:1e7) had 4 plumes, while the K half (treated with 1:1e5) had 40 plumes. That's inconsistent with the idea that the lysogenic phage would lyse and cause more plumes.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the treatment was applied to different strains. Wait, the B half was plated on strain B's lawn, and the K half was plated on strain K's lawn. So, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage caused more plumes on strain B's lawn, but on strain K's lawn, the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, when the B half is treated with 1:1e7 phages, which are more concentrated, the lysogenic phage is more likely to lyse the E. coli, causing more plumes. Conversely, when the K half is treated with 1:1e5 phages, which are less concentrated, the lysogenic phage hasn't had enough time to lyse all the E. coli, so fewer plumes are formed.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both mutations (the lysogenic phage causing lytic fission and the wild-type phage causing lysogenic fission) leads to more plumes when the lysogenic phage is more concentrated, but fewer plumes when the lysogenic phage is less concentrated, even though the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause issues when present.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage does cause issues\u2014it lyses the E. coli. So, if the lysogenic phage is present, it should lyse the E. coli, causing more plumes. So, why would the B half have fewer plumes than the K half?\n\nBecause on the B half, the lysogenic phage is more concentrated (1:1e7), so it's more likely to lyse the E. coli, leading to more plumes. On the K half, the lysogenic phage is less concentrated (1:1e5), so it's less likely to lyse the E. coli, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSo, the number of plumes correlates inversely with the dilution factor, which aligns with the observation that B had fewer plumes (4 vs. 40). Thus, the higher dilution factor on the B half led to more plumes, which supports the idea that the lysogenic phage caused issues.\n\nNow, going back to the original question: determine the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) refers to the proportion of double-stranded DNA regions where the two mutations are located. It ranges from 0% (no recombination) to 100% (complete recombination).\n\nTo find rf, we can use the formula relating the number of plumes observed to the mutation rates and recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the mutation frequencies and the recombination frequency, we can set up the following equation:\n\nNumber of plumes \u221d (m1 + m2 - f) * sqrt(D)\n\nWhere D is the dilution factor.\n\nGiven that, we can write:\n\nPlume_B = k * (m1 + m2 - f) * sqrt(D1)\nPlume_K = k * (m1 + m2 - f) * sqrt(D2)\n\nWhere Plume_B = 4, Plume_K = 40, D1 = 1e7, D2 = 1e5.\n\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission, the lysogenic ones should be the ones that lyse the E. coli, right? So the lysogenic phage would lyse the cells, causing the colonies to die. But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, making the E. coli lyse and die, while the wild-type phage (if any) might cause lysogenic fission, meaning it doesn't lyse the cell but lives longer. However, the question mentions \"mutantphages\" specifically\u2014so perhaps we're dealing with two different mutants within T_4, one causing lysogenic activity and the other causing lytic activity.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutants leads to a certain outcome. Normally, without any combination, you'd expect only one type of infection. But here, both are present, and the result is that half the population dies, as shown by the saturation being split equally between the two treatments. Wait, no\u2014the description says that the saturation is divided in half, half on B, half on K. Then, when the half on B is further diluted 1:1e7 and plated on B's lawn, 4 plumes appear. Similarly, the half on K is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. Hmm, that seems odd. Typically, if the same bacterium is used, the number of plumes would correlate based on the mutation rates. But here, the counts don't seem proportional. Maybe the dilution factors are important. For example, if the concentration of phages is such that the same number of plumes form on both plates, then the ratio of plumes would depend on the relative concentrations of the phages.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In a typical scenario where only one mutation exists, the number of plumes on each plate depends on the mutation rate and the dilution factor. If you dilute the phages more (lower dilution factor), the chance of infection increases, leading to more plumes. Conversely, a higher dilution factor reduces the chance of infection, resulting in fewer plumes. So in this case, the half that was treated with 1:1e7 phages was plated on strain B's lawn, and 4 plumes appeared. The other half, treated with 1:1e5 phages, was plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. That seems like a big difference\u2014only four vs. forty. That doesn't quite make sense unless the mutation rates are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed number of plumes relates to the product of the recombination frequency and the mutation rates. Recombination frequency (rf) is the percentage of double-stranded DNA regions where the two mutations are located. It ranges from 0% (no recombination) to 100% (complete recombination).\n\nThe formula to relate the number of plumes observed (N) is N = (f * (m1 + m2 - f)), where m1 and m2 are the mutation frequencies at each locus, and f is the recombination frequency. Alternatively, another approach is considering that when two mutations occur together, their combined effect affects the growth of the bacteria. In phage experiments, the number of plumes formed can indicate whether the mutations interfere or enhance each other.\n\nBut given the specific numbers provided: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, I suspect that the actual relationship isn't straightforward. Perhaps the correct way is to calculate the expected number of plumes based on the mutation frequencies and the recombination frequency. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Let\u2019s denote the mutation frequencies at each locus as m1 and m2.\n2. The recombination frequency is f.\n3. The total number of possible combinations is 4 (since each mutation can either be present or absent, but with recombination).\n4. Each combination has a probability of occurring, depending on f.\n5. The number of plumes observed on each plate depends on the product of the mutation frequency and the probability of the combination.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, the results aren't matching expectations. Normally, if only one mutation is present, you\u2019d see a certain number of plumes. Here, the presence of two mutations complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the experiment uses a dilution factor to control the density of phages in the solution. Higher dilution factor means fewer cells are exposed to each phage, reducing the chance of infection. So, if the phages are too concentrated, you get fewer plumes. Conversely, diluting them less (lower factor) gives more exposure, thus more plumes.\n\nSo, treating the half with 1:1e7 phages would lead to a higher chance of infection than the half with 1:1e5 phages. Therefore, on strain B's lawn, 4 plumes (from 1:1e7) versus 40 plumes (from 1:1e5). This suggests that the number of plumes decreases as the dilution factor increases, which makes sense because higher dilution factor means fewer cells, hence lower chance of infection.\n\nNow, thinking about the mathematical model: the number of plumes N is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor D, assuming Poisson statistics. So N ~ sqrt(D). Therefore, the ratio of plumes would be sqrt(1e7 / 1e5) = sqrt(100) = 10. But in our case, N_B = 4 and N_K = 40. Wait, that doesn\u2019t align directly because the plumes are on separate plates. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely related to the square root of the dilution factor, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of plumes on each plate reflects the product of the mutation probabilities and the recombination frequency. Suppose the number of plumes N is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f), where m1 and m2 are the mutation probabilities, and f is the recombination frequency. But since both mutations are present, the effective mutation rate is (m1 + m2 - f), because some double-strand breaks cancel each other out due to recombination.\n\nGiven that, if both mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to (m1 + m2 - f). However, in reality, the observed plumes may vary based on the exact distribution.\n\nBut perhaps the key lies in calculating the expected number of plumes under different conditions. Let's assume that each mutation occurs independently with certain probabilities. Let\u2019s say m1 is the probability of the first mutation (lytic phage), and m2 is the probability of the second mutation (lysozyme phage). The recombination frequency f tells us how often these mutations are together.\n\nIf both mutations happen together, the combined mutation rate would be (m1 + m2 - f), accounting for the fact that when both occur, they cancel each other due to recombination.\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f), we can set up equations based on the observed plumes.\n\nWhen the half is treated with 1:1e7 phages, it was plated on strain B's lawn. On strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, so m1 would be high, and m2 might be low or zero. Conversely, when treated with 1:1e5 phages, it was plated on strain K's lawn, where perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, so m2 is high, and m1 might be low or zero.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- D1 = 1e7 (dilution factor)\n- D2 = 1e5\n- Plumes on B = 4\n- Plumes on K = 40\n\nAssuming that the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f) multiplied by the dilution factor raised to some power. Let's hypothesize that N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f) * sqrt(D). So, for each treatment, N is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f) times the square root of D.\n\nThus, for D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nTaking the ratio N2/N1 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316.\n\nFrom the data, N2/N1 = 40/4 = 10.\n\nSetting 10 = 0.316*k, which implies k\u224831.6. But since k cancels out, it shows that the ratio holds true regardless of k.\n\nThis indicates that the expression N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D) is consistent with the observed plumes.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values. We know that on the B plate, D1=1e7, N1=4, and on the K plate, D2=1e5, N2=40.\n\nWe can write:\n\n4 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7) --> Equation 1\n40 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5) --> Equation 2\n\nDividing Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n\n40/4 = [k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)]/[k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)]\n\nSimplify:\n\n10 = sqrt(1e5 / 1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316\n\nWait, this doesn't add up because 10 \u2260 0.316. That must mean my initial assumption about the dependence on D is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the dependence is linear rather than involving square roots. Let me try again. Assume N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)*D.\n\nThen,\n\nFor D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*1e7\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*1e5\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nN2/N1 = (1e5)/(1e7) = 0.1\n\nBut in reality, N2/N1 = 10, so 0.1 \u2260 10. Hence, this model also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the relationship is inverse. Let's suppose N \u221d (m1 + m2 - f)/D.\n\nThen,\n\nFor D1=1e7, N1 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)/1e7\nFor D2=1e5, N2 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)/1e5\n\nRatio N2/N1 = (1e5)/(1e7) = 0.01\n\nAgain, not matching 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps N \u221d sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D).\n\nThen,\n\nN1 = k*sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nN2 = k*sqrt(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nRatio N2/N1 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316, still not 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plumes is proportional to (m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(D). Let's test that.\n\nEquation 1: 4 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)\nEquation 2: 40 = k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)\n\nDivide Equation 2 by Equation 1:\n\n40/4 = [k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e5)]/[k*(m1 + m2 - f)*sqrt(1e7)]\nWhich simplifies to:\n10 = sqrt(1e5/1e7) = sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316\n\nBut 10 \u2248 0.316, which is false. Thus, this model is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Instead of trying to model the expectation, maybe I should use the observed numbers to solve for the recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose that the presence of two mutations causes interference in their effects, leading to fewer plumes compared to when only one mutation is present. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the observed number of plumes could reflect the effectiveness of each mutation on the phage's ability to infect. If both mutations are present, they might reduce the number of successful infections, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes is higher on K (40) than on B (4). On K, presumably, the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, so m2 is high. On B, the lysogenic phage did cause issues, so m1 is high.\n\nSo, treating with 1:1e5 phages on B (which is K's lawn) resulted in 4 plumes, whereas treating with 1:1e7 phages on K's lawn (which is strain B's lawn) resulted in 40 plumes. This suggests that the higher dilution factor (1:1e7) on B led to more plumes, implying that strain B had a lower mutation rate at its locus.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both mutations are present, their presence should increase the chance of infection. So why are there more plumes on B?\n\nAh, perhaps because on B's lawn, the treatment with 1:1e7 phages is more likely to expose the lysogenic phage, causing more plumes. But on K's lawn, the treatment with 1:1e5 phages is more likely to expose the wild-type phage, which didn't cause issues, leading to fewer plumes. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the result after division and plating was half on B and half on K. Then, the half on B was treated with 1:1e7 phages, and the half on K with 1:1e5 phages.\n\nSo, for the B half: 1:1e7 phages treated, which would be more concentrated, exposing more cells and potentially more phages, leading to more infections, more plumes.\n\nFor the K half: 1:1e5 phages treated, which is less concentrated, exposing fewer cells and phages, leading to fewer infections, fewer plumes.\n\nBut according to the results, there were 40 plumes on K and 4 on B.

That's inconsistent with the idea that the lysogenic phage would lyse and cause more plumes.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the treatment was applied to different strains. Wait, the B half was plated on strain B's lawn, and the K half was plated on strain K's lawn. So, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage caused more plumes on strain B's lawn, but on strain K's lawn, the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, when the B half is treated with 1:1e7 phages, which are more concentrated, the lysogenic phage is more likely to lyse the E. coli, causing more plumes.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe key point here is that when both types are present, the effect is similar to having only one type. Because strain B is mostly affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage (the one causing lysosis) isn't doing much when combined with another mutation. This implies that their effects partially overlap or perhaps recombine. However, since both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages would dominate unless they're being recombined. \n\nWait, but in reality, if two different mutations occur in the same gene, they might either interfere with each other (so the effects don't add up) or combine to produce a new phenotype. In this case, the presence of both mutations leads to the same outcome as having only one mutation. That's interesting because normally, if two mutations are independent, you'd expect some interference or combination effects. Here, the result suggests no significant interference; instead, they're combining without affecting the overall outcome. \n\nSo, to calculate recombination frequency, I remember that it's usually expressed as the percentage of cases where two alleles from different loci interact. The formula is 100 * (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring). But wait, in this context, it's slightly different because we're dealing with phages and their interactions. Alternatively, I've heard that the number of recombinants relates to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Since the results show no significant interference, the expected number of recombinants should be near zero. \n\nLet me try to approach this differently. The probability that a phage carrying one mutation will cause a certain effect when combined with another mutation depends on whether they are recombining. If they are recombining, the effect could be additive or dominant. If not, they might interfere. \n\nIn this scenario, when both mutations are present, the effect is similar to having only one mutation. That suggests that the second mutation is interfering with the first in a way that doesn't change the overall outcome. So, maybe the second mutation is not recombining but rather disrupting the first mutation in such a way that it doesn't affect the phenotype. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of both mutations in the same host cell could lead to recombination within the phage DNA, creating new combinations. However, the results indicate that the overall effect remains unchanged compared to having only one mutation, implying that the combination doesn't disrupt the original effect. Therefore, there's likely no significant recombination occurring between the two mutations. \n\nTo quantify this, I think the number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But since the problem states that the presence of both mutations doesn't change the outcome, the observed effect suggests that the mutations are not recombining. Therefore, the recombination frequency is low, probably less than 1%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible. \n\nWait, but sometimes the calculation uses the square root approximation for genetic recombination. The formula is sqrt(p*q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. If the recombination frequency is very low, then p*q would be small, leading to few recombinant individuals. Given that the results didn't show any additional infections beyond what would be expected from one mutation, the recombination must be minimal. So, the correct answer would be F, 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

This implies that their effects partially overlap or perhaps recombine. However, since both types are present, the presence of lysogenic phages would dominate unless they're being recombined. \n\nWait, but in reality, if two different mutations occur in the same gene, they might either interfere with each other (so the effects don't add up) or combine to produce a new phenotype. In this case, the presence of both mutations leads to the same outcome as having only one mutation. That's interesting because normally, if two mutations are independent, you'd expect some interference or combination effects. Here, the result suggests no significant interference; instead, they're combining without affecting the overall outcome. \n\nSo, to calculate recombination frequency, I remember that it's usually expressed as the percentage of cases where two alleles from different loci interact. The formula is 100 * (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring). But wait, in this context, it's slightly different because we're dealing with phages and their interactions. Alternatively, I've heard that the number of recombinants relates to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Since the results show no significant interference, the expected number of recombinants should be near zero. \n\nLet me try to approach this differently. The probability that a phage carrying one mutation will cause a certain effect when combined with another mutation depends on whether they are recombining. If they are recombining, the effect could be additive or dominant. If not, they might interfere. \n\nIn this scenario, when both mutations are present, the effect is similar to having only one mutation. That suggests that the second mutation is interfering with the first in a way that doesn't change the overall outcome. So, maybe the second mutation is not recombining but rather disrupting the first mutation in such a way that it doesn't affect the phenotype. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of both mutations in the same host cell could lead to recombination within the phage DNA, creating new combinations. However, the results indicate that the overall effect remains unchanged compared to having only one mutation, implying that the combination doesn't disrupt the original effect. Therefore, there's likely no significant recombination occurring between the two mutations. \n\nTo quantify this, I think the number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But since the problem states that the presence of both mutations doesn't change the outcome, the observed effect suggests that the mutations are not recombining. Therefore, the recombination frequency is low, probably less than 1%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible. \n\nWait, but sometimes the calculation uses the square root approximation for genetic recombination. The formula is sqrt(p*q), where p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations. If the recombination frequency is very low, then p*q would be small, leading to few recombinant individuals. Given that the results didn't show any additional infections beyond what would be expected from one mutation, the recombination must be minimal. So, the correct answer would be F, 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "In the first case, only lysogenic phages cause problems because they don't lyse.",
    "rollout": " In the first case, only lysogenic phages cause problems because they don't lyse. So in the first half, they're probably just lysogenic phages, which don't lyse, hence no problem. Then the second half has both lysogenic and non-lysed phages, causing issues. So the effect is that the lysogenic phages from both types interfere. Now, looking at the results: in the first plate, only strain B was affected because the phages were lysogenic and didn't lyse. On the second plate, both types of phages are present, so they should cause more issues, leading to more plumes on B. But wait, the numbers are different. On the first plate, 40 plumes on B, and on the second plate, 4 on K. Hmm, that seems odd because the second plate is supposed to be less affected than the first, but here B has more. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both types leads to interference, reducing the effectiveness. So when both are present, the number of successful infections decreases, leading to fewer plumes on B. So in the first plate, only lysogenic phages (which are type A) cause issues, resulting in 40 plumes on B. On the second plate, both types (A and B) are present, so the phages are interfering, leading to fewer plumes on B\u2014maybe 4 instead of 40? Or perhaps the opposite. Wait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So the second half is a mix where both mutation types are present. The result is that on K's lawn, 4 plumes are found, while on B's lawn, 40 plumes are found. That suggests that the mixture caused more effective killing on B than either mutation alone would do. Wait, but the initial statement said that only the lysogenic phage causes problems, and now with both present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. So perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage from another type enhances the effect. This could happen through recombination. Recombination increases the efficiency of phage replication inside the E. coli, possibly making the lysogenic phage more efficient. So when you have both types, their combined activity might lead to more successful infections. Therefore, the recombination frequency between the two mutations would determine how much they enhance each other's effects. The formula for calculating the expected number of recombinants is given by the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Since we're dealing with a recombination coefficient (c), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be c * f1 * f2, where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutations. However, in this experiment, the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful plasmids compared to when only one is present. Wait, but in the first case, only lysogenic phages (from type A) are present, so they shouldn't recombine. So the presence of type B phages (mutant) should increase the number of successful plasmids. But according to the data, the presence of both leads to fewer plumes on B than either alone. So perhaps there's a decrease in the number of successful plasmids due to some interference. Alternatively, maybe the combination allows for better efficiency. To calculate recombination frequency, I think the formula is c = (observed - expected)/expected. The observed here might be the number of recombinant plasmids, but in our case, when both types are present, the number of successful infections (plumes) is less than when only one type is present. So perhaps the presence of the other type reduces the number of successful infections. But without knowing the actual counts before and after, it's tricky. Alternatively, using the approach where the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequencies. Let me try setting up equations. Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the non-lysed (mutant) phage and q as the frequency of the lysed (mutant) phage. The expected number of successful plasmids when both are present should be higher than when only lysed or only non-lysed are present. However, in reality, the presence of both may reduce the success. Wait, but in our case, the first plate (only lysed) had 40 plumes, and the second (both types) had 4. That suggests that the presence of the non-lysed phage reduces the number of successful plasmids. Alternatively, the presence of the non-lysed phage enhances the success. I'm confused. Let me think differently. The recombination coefficient (c) is calculated as (observed - expected)/expected. If we assume that when both mutations are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is the sum of the products of the individual frequencies. But without knowing the exact counts, perhaps a simpler approach is needed. Alternatively, the observed number of recombinants can help us find the recombination frequency. Suppose the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of the frequencies of the two mutants. So c = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(number of possible recombinants). But in our case, when both types are present, the number of plumes on B is 4, which is lower than when only lysogenics (type A) are present (40). So perhaps the presence of non-lysed phages reduces the number of successful infections. Alternatively, maybe the non-lysed phages increase the number of infections. Wait, but in the first case, all the plasmids are lysogenic, so they shouldn't recombine. So perhaps the presence of the non-lysed phages makes them more efficient, thus reducing the number of successful infections. But in reality, when you add more phages, the total number of potential infections increases, but the efficiency depends on whether they recombine. If recombination occurs, the phages might replicate more efficiently, leading to more infections. Alternatively, without recombination, they replicate normally. So in the absence of recombination, the number of infections would be lower, but with recombination, higher. But in our case, adding the non-lysed phages increased the number of infections. Wait, no, because the first plate has 40, and the second has 4. So adding the non-lysed phages decreased the number of plumes on B. That suggests that the non-lysed phages reduced the number of successful infections. How? Perhaps they made the phages more efficient. For example, if the lysogenic phages are less efficient without recombination, then adding a non-lysed phage that combines with them might make them more efficient. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the non-lysed phages might cause the lysogenic phages to replicate more effectively, leading to more infections. But in our case, adding the non-lysed phages decreased the number of plumes, meaning fewer infections. Hmm, maybe the reverse. So the non-lysed phages are making the lysogenic ones less efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of non-lysed phages interferes with the lysogenic ones, reducing their activity. Either way, it's getting complicated. Let's try to model it. Let\u2019s say that when both types are present, the number of successful infections is N = N_A + N_B - R, where R is the overlap due to recombination. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of the non-lysed phages might increase the number of successful infections because they allow the lysogenic phages to replicate more efficiently. If that were the case, then having both types would lead to more plumes, not fewer. But in our data, it's fewer. So maybe the opposite is true: the non-lysed phages reduce the number of successful infections. So perhaps the presence of the non-lysed phages makes the lysogenic ones less active. Alternatively, the non-lysed phages might act as a stressor, making the lysogenic phages die earlier, thus reducing the number of successful infections. So in any case, the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful plasmids. To find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (c) = (Observed number of recombinant plasmids - Expected number of recombinant plasmids) / Expected number of recombinant plasmids.\n\nBut in our case, when both mutations are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is 4 (on B), and without either mutation, it's 40 (on B). So,\n\nc = (4 - 40) / 40 = (-36)/40 = -0.9. That can\u2019t be right because a negative frequency doesn\u2019t make sense. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the non-lysed phage allows the lysogenic phage to replicate more efficiently, thereby increasing the number of plasmids. But in our data, it's fewer, so that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the non-lysed phage makes the lysogenic phage less efficient, thus reducing the number of plasmids. So perhaps the observed number of recombinants is lower than expected. So,\n\nc = (observed - expected)/expected = (4 - 40)/40 = same as above, negative. Doesn\u2019t make sense. Maybe I need to consider the correct formula. Another approach: The number of recombinant plasmids can also be modeled as the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the non-lysed phage and q as the frequency of the lysed phage. The expected number of recombinants would be pq. But in our case, when both are present, the number of recombinants is 4, whereas when only lysed (p=0) or only non-lysed (q=0) are present, the number of recombinants is 40. Wait, but if q=0, then the expected number of recombinants would be 0, but in reality, when only lysed are present, the number is 40. Hmm, that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps when both are present, the number of recombinants is pq plus something else. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the number of recombinants can be expressed as the sum of the products of the two mutation frequencies minus the recombination itself. But without exact counts, it's challenging. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful plasmids, the recombination coefficient c can be estimated as c = (N_observed - N_expected)/N_expected. Here, N_observed is 4, N_expected is 40. So c = (4 - 40)/40 = -0.9. Again, negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently. The recombination frequency is typically measured in terms of the percentage of double crossovers. It ranges from 0% to 100%. If the two mutations are closely linked, c approaches 100%, meaning nearly every crossing over causes recombination. If they are far apart, c approaches 0%. In this scenario, the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful infections, suggesting that their presence causes some interference, possibly through recombination. The amount of recombination would depend on how often the two mutations interact. Since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and both affect it, perhaps the recombination is high enough to cause some interference, but not complete. The answer choices go down to 0.02%, which is quite low. Alternatively, considering that the result is that 4 out of 40 on B are recombinant, that's 10%, but that's not among the options. Wait, the options are percentages like 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., so likely a very small fraction. So perhaps the recombination coefficient is around 0.02% or similar. Alternatively, maybe the calculation requires considering the reciprocal of the dilutions or something else. Alternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids increases, but the number of successful infections decreases. So perhaps the ratio between the number of recombinant plasmids and the total plasmids gives the recombination frequency. But without exact numbers, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Given that when both are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and when only one is present, it's 40. So,\n\nIf F1 is the frequency of the non-lysed phage and F2 is the frequency of the lysed phage, then:\n\nNumber of recombinant plasmids when both are present: F1 * F2 * N_total\n\nWhen only lysed: F2 * N_total\n\nGiven that F1*F2*N_total = 4 and F2*N_total = 40, then substituting F1*F2 = 4/40 = 0.1. Thus, F1*F2 = 0.1. Now, the recombination coefficient c is equal to F1*F2, assuming no interference. So c = 0.1, which corresponds to 10%. But none of the options are 10%. The closest is option D, 0.02%, but that's much lower. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship. Wait, maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of F1 and F2 multiplied by the total number of plasmids. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is c = (R - (N_A + N_B - R)) / (N_A + N_B), where R is the number of recombinant plasmids. But again, without exact values, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that when both mutations are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of the frequencies, which equals 0.1 times the total plasmids. So c = 0.1, which is 10%. But the options don't include 10%. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different interpretation. Maybe the presence of both mutations leads to a certain level of interference, and the recombination coefficient is inversely related to the number of plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is calculated as c = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total plasmids). If when both are present, the number is 4 and the total is, say, 44 (since 40 on B and 4 on K), but without exact numbers, it's impossible to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, which is option A. But earlier calculations suggested 10%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids is 44 (40 on B and 4 on K), so the average is 44/2 = 22. Each plasmid has a 1% chance of being recombinant, so expected recombinants would be 22 * 0.01 = 0.22, which rounds to 0.2%. But the options include 0.02%, which is even smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is 0.02%, which is the smallest option. But this is speculative. Considering all possibilities, the most plausible answer based on the data provided is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.02%, as that's a very low recombination rate, indicating strong linkage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is c = (4 - 40)/40 = -0.9, which is impossible, so perhaps I need to reconsider the approach. Maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40, so the ratio is 1:10. Thus, the recombination frequency would be 1/(1+10) = 1/11 \u2248 9.1%, but again, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is calculated as (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total plasmids) = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is close to 1%, but still not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination coefficient is approximately 1%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is the lowest available, which is 0.02%. However, without precise data, it's challenging to determine. Based on the information provided, the most reasonable conclusion is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, but since that's not an option, the closest is E. 0.05%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total plasmids are 44 (40 on B and 4 on K). Thus, c = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is approximately 1%, but again, not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, which is the smallest option. However, without exact data, it's hard to pin down. Given the options, I'll choose E. 0.05%, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5%, but I don't see why.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Therefore, the recombination frequency between the two mutations would determine how much they enhance each other's effects. The formula for calculating the expected number of recombinants is given by the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Since we're dealing with a recombination coefficient (c), the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be c * f1 * f2, where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two mutations.

Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the non-lysed phage and q as the frequency of the lysed phage. The expected number of recombinants would be pq. But in our case, when both are present, the number of recombinants is 4, whereas when only lysed (p=0) or only non-lysed (q=0) are present, the number of recombinants is 40. Wait, but if q=0, then the expected number of recombinants would be 0, but in reality, when only lysed are present, the number is 40. Hmm, that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps when both are present, the number of recombinants is pq plus something else. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the number of recombinants can be expressed as the sum of the products of the two mutation frequencies minus the recombination itself. But without exact counts, it's challenging. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful plasmids, the recombination coefficient c can be estimated as c = (N_observed - N_expected)/N_expected. Here, N_observed is 4, N_expected is 40. So c = (4 - 40)/40 = -0.9. Again, negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently. The recombination frequency is typically measured in terms of the percentage of double crossovers. It ranges from 0% to 100%. If the two mutations are closely linked, c approaches 100%, meaning nearly every crossing over causes recombination. If they are far apart, c approaches 0%. In this scenario, the presence of both mutations reduces the number of successful infections, suggesting that their presence causes some interference, possibly through recombination. The amount of recombination would depend on how often the two mutations interact. Since the problem states that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and both affect it, perhaps the recombination is high enough to cause some interference, but not complete. The answer choices go down to 0.02%, which is quite low. Alternatively, considering that the result is that 4 out of 40 on B are recombinant, that's 10%, but that's not among the options. Wait, the options are percentages like 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., so likely a very small fraction. So perhaps the recombination coefficient is around 0.02% or similar. Alternatively, maybe the calculation requires considering the reciprocal of the dilutions or something else. Alternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids increases, but the number of successful infections decreases. So perhaps the ratio between the number of recombinant plasmids and the total plasmids gives the recombination frequency. But without exact numbers, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Given that when both are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and when only one is present, it's 40. So,\n\nIf F1 is the frequency of the non-lysed phage and F2 is the frequency of the lysed phage, then:\n\nNumber of recombinant plasmids when both are present: F1 * F2 * N_total\n\nWhen only lysed: F2 * N_total\n\nGiven that F1*F2*N_total = 4 and F2*N_total = 40, then substituting F1*F2 = 4/40 = 0.1. Thus, F1*F2 = 0.1. Now, the recombination coefficient c is equal to F1*F2, assuming no interference. So c = 0.1, which corresponds to 10%. But none of the options are 10%. The closest is option D, 0.02%, but that's much lower. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship. Wait, maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of F1 and F2 multiplied by the total number of plasmids. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is c = (R - (N_A + N_B - R)) / (N_A + N_B), where R is the number of recombinant plasmids. But again, without exact values, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that when both mutations are present, the number of recombinant plasmids is the product of the frequencies, which equals 0.1 times the total plasmids. So c = 0.1, which is 10%. But the options don't include 10%. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different interpretation. Maybe the presence of both mutations leads to a certain level of interference, and the recombination coefficient is inversely related to the number of plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is calculated as c = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total plasmids). If when both are present, the number is 4 and the total is, say, 44 (since 40 on B and 4 on K), but without exact numbers, it's impossible to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, which is option A. But earlier calculations suggested 10%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids is 44 (40 on B and 4 on K), so the average is 44/2 = 22. Each plasmid has a 1% chance of being recombinant, so expected recombinants would be 22 * 0.01 = 0.22, which rounds to 0.2%. But the options include 0.02%, which is even smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is 0.02%, which is the smallest option. But this is speculative. Considering all possibilities, the most plausible answer based on the data provided is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.02%, as that's a very low recombination rate, indicating strong linkage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is c = (4 - 40)/40 = -0.9, which is impossible, so perhaps I need to reconsider the approach. Maybe the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40, so the ratio is 1:10. Thus, the recombination frequency would be 1/(1+10) = 1/11 \u2248 9.1%, but again, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination coefficient is calculated as (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total plasmids) = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is close to 1%, but still not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the recombination coefficient is approximately 1%, but since that's not an option, the next best choice is the lowest available, which is 0.02%. However, without precise data, it's challenging to determine. Based on the information provided, the most reasonable conclusion is that the recombination frequency is approximately 1%, but since that's not an option, the closest is E. 0.05%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total plasmids are 44 (40 on B and 4 on K). Thus, c = 4/44 \u2248 0.09, which is approximately 1%, but again, not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.02%, which is the smallest option. However, without exact data, it's hard to pin down. Given the options, I'll choose E. 0.05%, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5%, but I don't see why.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Recombination would lead to an increased chance of either mutation occurring independently. \n\nIn the first half, they're diluting at 1:1e7, so each well has 1 cell. Plated on strain B's lawn, which should be strain B's cells. If there are 40 plumes on B, that suggests that out of 100 million cells (since 1e7), 40 are infected. That gives a basic infection rate, but we're interested in recombination. The second half is diluting at 1:1e5, so each well has 100 cells. Plated on strain K's lawn. They got 4 plumes here, meaning 4 out of 100 cells are infected. Hmm, but wait, the initial condition was that all E. coli strain B was infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. So the total number of phages is the sum of both types. However, upon combining both types, the effect is different than each alone because of recombination. The presence of both mutations might cause some cells to be susceptible due to interference, leading to higher numbers of plumes.\n\nWait, no, the problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. So maybe the recombination leads to a situation where some cells are not susceptible, thus producing more plumes. Alternatively, if the mutations are complementary, they might cause more plumes. But in the experiment, they observed more plumes on strain K (4 vs 40 on B). Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Oh, so the first half is on strain B, and the second half is on strain K. The counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. So when you plated on strain B, you had 40 plumes, and when you plated on strain K, you had 4 plumes. Now, considering that both strains are being plated, but the results depend on whether the phages affect their respective backgrounds.\n\nIf the original experiment was that strain B was mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage caused issues. But when both phages are present, the result changes. This suggests that the presence of both mutations reduces the susceptibility of the cells, allowing more infections. So if both mutations contribute to the same resistance mechanism, then having both might allow more phages to infect the cells, hence more plumes.\n\nNow, the key part is figuring out the recombination frequency. Recombination refers to the proportion of double mutants versus wild-type or non-mutant cells. In this context, the two phage types (mutant and non-mutant) recombine, and this affects the likelihood of plating. The number of plumes relates to the probability of infection given the phage load.\n\nLet me recall that in such experiments, the number of plumes depends on the fitness of the phage population. If a phage is more fit, it will infect more cells, leading to more plumes. Alternatively, if a mutation confers a higher fitness (resistance), it may reduce the number of plumes because fewer cells are susceptible. But in this case, both mutations are causing problems, so they might interfere constructively.\n\nAlternatively, if the two mutations are recombined, they could produce a cell type that is resistant to both phages, reducing the chance of infection. But in the results, the majority of cells in the B group were affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is dominant, while the other mutation isn't as impactful. Or maybe the combination increases the number of plumes because the phages are interfering with each other's effects.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes under different conditions and see the ratio. Normally, without any mutations, all phages infect all cells, so the number of plumes would be proportional to the number of cells. With both mutations present, perhaps some cells are less susceptible, leading to more plumes. The ratio of plumes on K to B would help determine the level of recombination.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the probability of infection. The number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of phages and cells. Let\u2019s denote C_p as the concentration of phages, and N_b and N_k as the concentrations of E. coli strain B and K respectively. The number of plumes on B is proportional to C_p * N_b, and on K, it's proportional to C_p * N_k. However, since the phages are from both types, the actual C_p might involve the product of the concentrations of the two types.\n\nWait, but in this experiment, the phages are either mutant A or mutant B, each at a certain concentration. So the total C_p = C_A + C_B, where C_A and C_B are the concentrations of the two mutation types. Then, the number of plumes on B would be proportional to (C_A + C_B) * N_B, and on K, it's proportional to (C_A + C_B) * N_K. But in reality, since the experiment shows 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, and the concentrations are similar, we can set up a ratio.\n\nAssuming the background concentrations are roughly equal (same number of cells plated), the ratio of plumes on K to B would be approximately (N_K)/(N_B). But according to the results, it's 4/40=1/10. So N_K/N_B=1/10. Assuming equal dilution factors, the concentrations would be inversely proportional to the dilution factors. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe instead, the relative fitnesses of the two phages matter. If the recombination leads to a more fit phage, the number of plumes would decrease.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the concept of interference: if the two mutations interfere constructively, they might enhance each other's effects, leading to more plumes. But in this case, both mutations are causing issues, so perhaps they interfere destructively, reducing the number of plumes. But the results show more plumes on B, which suggests that the presence of the other mutation doesn't completely mask the effect of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the phages and the number of cells. So if both mutations are present, the effective concentration of phages is (C_A + C_B), assuming they don't interfere. The number of plumes on B would be proportional to (C_A + C_B)*N_B, and on K, (C_A + C_B)*N_K. But if the phages are recombining, their concentrations might be adjusted, affecting the overall plume count.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct model is that when both mutations are present, the effective phage concentration is (C_A + C_B) / (1 - R), where R is the recombination fraction. So the number of plumes would be proportional to (C_A + C_B)/(1 - R) multiplied by the number of cells. Therefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B would be [ (C_A + C_B)/(1 - R_K) ] / [ (C_A + C_B)/(1 - R_B) ) ] = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K).\n\nGiven that, and knowing that in our case, the plumes on K are 4 and on B are 40, and assuming that the background concentrations are roughly the same (equal dilution factors), we can write:\n\n4 = [ (1 - R_B) / (1 - R_K) ] * 40\n\nSo, 4/40 = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/10 = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)\n\nAssuming that the recombination fractions R_B and R_K are small (which they typically are), we can approximate using log(1-x) \u2248 -x for small x. Taking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/10) \u2248 ln[(1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)] \u2248 (-R_B)/(-R_K) = R_B/R_K\n\nSo, R_B/R_K \u2248 -ln(1/10) \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nThus, R_B/R_K \u2248 2.3026 \u2192 R_B \u2248 2.3026 * R_K\n\nBut I think I made a mistake in the approximation; actually, ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b), so ln((1-R_B)/(1-R_K)) = ln(1-R_B) - ln(1-R_K). For small R, ln(1-R) \u2248 -R. Thus,\n\nln((1-R_B)/(1-R_K)) \u2248 (-R_B) - (-R_K) = R_K - R_B\n\nAnd setting this equal to ln(1/10)= -2.3026,\n\nR_K - R_B \u2248 -2.3026 \u2192 R_B \u2248 R_K + 2.3026\n\nBut without knowing R_K, this seems tricky. Perhaps another approach is needed. Alternatively, consider that the main difference between B and K is the number of plumes, so the change in plume density is influenced by the ratio of plumes.\n\nSince the experiment showed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10. If the recombination allows for a more efficient interaction, this reduction makes sense.\n\nThe relationship between the recombination frequency (R) and the ratio of plume densities can be approximated as:\n\n\u0394 = 1/(1 - R)\n\nWhere \u0394 is the ratio of plume densities. Here, \u0394 = 4/40 = 1/10.\n\nSo, 1/(1 - R) = 1/10 \u2192 1 - R = 10 \u2192 R = -9\n\nThis negative value doesn't make sense because R is a positive fraction. Therefore, my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps a better model is that the recombination leads to a decreased susceptibility, so the effective concentration of phages is reduced by the recombination fraction. Then, the number of plumes would scale as (1 - R) times the background concentration.\n\nSo, if the effective concentration is (1 - R) times the background concentration, then the number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - R) * N, where N is the background concentration. Therefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B would be:\n\n(1 - R_K) / (1 - R_B) = 40 / 4 = 10\n\nWe need to find R_K and R_B. Assuming that R_B is much smaller than R_K, so 1 - R_B \u2248 1, then:\n\n(1 - R_K) \u2248 10*(1 - R_B)\n\nNeglecting terms involving R_B (if R_B is very small):\n\n- R_K \u2248 -10*R_B \u2192 R_K \u2248 10*R_B\n\nBut without additional information, this still leaves multiple possibilities. However, the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which is represented by R. From the options provided, the possible answers are in percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%.\n\nUsing the approximation earlier, if the recombination frequency is low, say around 0.1%, which corresponds to R \u2248 0.001, then 1/(1 - R) \u2248 1 + R \u2248 1.001. But in our case, the ratio is 10, so 1/(1 - R) \u2248 10 \u2192 1 - R \u2248 0.1 \u2192 R \u2248 0.9, which is impossible because R cannot exceed 1. Hence, this indicates that the approximation needs adjustment.\n\nAnother thought: if the two mutations are linked (i.e., recombine), their combined effect is greater than either individually. Therefore, the number of plumes would be higher when both mutations are present, but in this case, the presence of both mutations led to more plumes on B than on K. This suggests that the other mutation did not interfere constructively but rather partially constructively, leading to higher susceptibility in the presence of both.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation requires knowing the precise relationship between R and the plume ratios. Given the limited data, perhaps the best estimate is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1%. Looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc. Option H is 5%, which is too high. Option D is 0.05%, which is closer to 0.1%, but slightly lower. Option C is 1.5%, which is also higher. Option A is 1 percent, which is too high.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1, indicating that the presence of both mutations reduces the effectiveness by a factor of 10. The relationship between R and the plume ratio is \u0394 = 1/(1 - R), so 1/(1 - R) = 10 \u2192 1 - R = 0.1 \u2192 R = 0.9. Again, this is impossible because R cannot exceed 1. Therefore, this suggests that the recombination frequency is extremely high, which contradicts typical values. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination fraction is small, and the number of plumes reflects the interference between the mutations.\n\nConsidering that, the correct answer is likely option H (5%) or D (0.05%). However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to choose accurately. Given the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1%, corresponding to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Therefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B would be [ (C_A + C_B)/(1 - R_K) ] / [ (C_A + C_B)/(1 - R_B) ) ] = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K).\n\nGiven that, and knowing that in our case, the plumes on K are 4 and on B are 40, and assuming that the background concentrations are roughly the same (equal dilution factors), we can write:\n\n4 = [ (1 - R_B) / (1 - R_K) ] * 40\n\nSo, 4/40 = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)\n\nWhich simplifies to 1/10 = (1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)\n\nAssuming that the recombination fractions R_B and R_K are small (which they typically are), we can approximate using log(1-x) \u2248 -x for small x. Taking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/10) \u2248 ln[(1 - R_B)/(1 - R_K)] \u2248 (-R_B)/(-R_K) = R_B/R_K\n\nSo, R_B/R_K \u2248 -ln(1/10) \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nThus, R_B/R_K \u2248 2.3026 \u2192 R_B \u2248 2.3026 * R_K\n\nBut I think I made a mistake in the approximation; actually, ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b), so ln((1-R_B)/(1-R_K)) = ln(1-R_B) - ln(1-R_K). For small R, ln(1-R) \u2248 -R. Thus,\n\nln((1-R_B)/(1-R_K)) \u2248 (-R_B) - (-R_K) = R_K - R_B\n\nAnd setting this equal to ln(1/10)= -2.3026,\n\nR_K - R_B \u2248 -2.3026 \u2192 R_B \u2248 R_K + 2.3026\n\nBut without knowing R_K, this seems tricky. Perhaps another approach is needed. Alternatively, consider that the main difference between B and K is the number of plumes, so the change in plume density is influenced by the ratio of plumes.\n\nSince the experiment showed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation reduces the number of plumes by a factor of 10. If the recombination allows for a more efficient interaction, this reduction makes sense.\n\nThe relationship between the recombination frequency (R) and the ratio of plume densities can be approximated as:\n\n\u0394 = 1/(1 - R)\n\nWhere \u0394 is the ratio of plume densities. Here, \u0394 = 4/40 = 1/10.\n\nSo, 1/(1 - R) = 1/10 \u2192 1 - R = 10 \u2192 R = -9\n\nThis negative value doesn't make sense because R is a positive fraction. Therefore, my assumption must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps a better model is that the recombination leads to a decreased susceptibility, so the effective concentration of phages is reduced by the recombination fraction. Then, the number of plumes would scale as (1 - R) times the background concentration.\n\nSo, if the effective concentration is (1 - R) times the background concentration, then the number of plumes would be proportional to (1 - R) * N, where N is the background concentration. Therefore, the ratio of plumes on K to B would be:\n\n(1 - R_K) / (1 - R_B) = 40 / 4 = 10\n\nWe need to find R_K and R_B. Assuming that R_B is much smaller than R_K, so 1 - R_B \u2248 1, then:\n\n(1 - R_K) \u2248 10*(1 - R_B)\n\nNeglecting terms involving R_B (if R_B is very small):\n\n- R_K \u2248 -10*R_B \u2192 R_K \u2248 10*R_B\n\nBut without additional information, this still leaves multiple possibilities. However, the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which is represented by R. From the options provided, the possible answers are in percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 5%.\n\nUsing the approximation earlier, if the recombination frequency is low, say around 0.1%, which corresponds to R \u2248 0.001, then 1/(1 - R) \u2248 1 + R \u2248 1.001. But in our case, the ratio is 10, so 1/(1 - R) \u2248 10 \u2192 1 - R \u2248 0.1 \u2192 R \u2248 0.9, which is impossible because R cannot exceed 1. Hence, this indicates that the approximation needs adjustment.\n\nAnother thought: if the two mutations are linked (i.e., recombine), their combined effect is greater than either individually. Therefore, the number of plumes would be higher when both mutations are present, but in this case, the presence of both mutations led to more plumes on B than on K. This suggests that the other mutation did not interfere constructively but rather partially constructively, leading to higher susceptibility in the presence of both.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation requires knowing the precise relationship between R and the plume ratios. Given the limited data, perhaps the best estimate is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1%. Looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc. Option H is 5%, which is too high. Option D is 0.05%, which is closer to 0.1%, but slightly lower. Option C is 1.5%, which is also higher. Option A is 1 percent, which is too high.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio of plumes is 40:4, which is 10:1, indicating that the presence of both mutations reduces the effectiveness by a factor of 10. The relationship between R and the plume ratio is \u0394 = 1/(1 - R), so 1/(1 - R) = 10 \u2192 1 - R = 0.1 \u2192 R = 0.9. Again, this is impossible because R cannot exceed 1. Therefore, this suggests that the recombination frequency is extremely high, which contradicts typical values. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination fraction is small, and the number of plumes reflects the interference between the mutations.\n\nConsidering that, the correct answer is likely option H (5%) or D (0.05%). However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to choose accurately. Given the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1%, corresponding to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission, leading to cell death. So why would strain B be affected? Maybe it's because the lysogenic phage is combining with another mutation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated within the lysogenic phage, causing it to cause lytic fission even without a separate mutation elsewhere. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing the lysogenic fission, but the lysogenic fission leads to cell death, which could interact with another mutation elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the results again. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which makes sense because the lysogenic phage is the one doing the damage. However, the other half is plated on strain K. Strain K isn't mentioned as being affected, but the results showed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (from both mutants) is causing enough infections on strain B to result in 40 plumes, while on strain K, the presence of the lysogenic phage didn't lead to as many infections. Wait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage should be the ones causing the issue on strain B. So when both types are present, the E. coli strain B has fewer plumes than the other half, which is expected because the lysogenic phage is the one causing damage. But the other half (strained K) wasn't affected much. Now, considering that the presence of multiple phages increases the likelihood of their combination causing new effects, like double-strand break repair. So when both phages are present, their combination might lead to double-strand breaks, which can be repaired inefficiently, leading to more infections and thus more plumes. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is interacting with another mutation, such as a mutation in the T4 locus that allows it to replicate within itself. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing the lysogenic fission, but its replication inside the phage leads to double-strand breaks, which can be repaired by the lysogenic phage, allowing it to survive longer. Then, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage can cause more infections because it can now handle the repair mechanisms. This would increase the number of plumes on strain B compared to just the lysogenic phage alone. But according to the data, the lysogenic phage alone (only the first half?) resulted in a certain number of plumes, and when both are present, the second half shows a different number. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the halves. Let me clarify: the first half had both mutant phages, but only the lysogenic one caused the damage, resulting in 40 plumes on strain B. The second half had only the lysogenic phage, but when plated on strain K, it didn't affect much, showing 4 plumes on K. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if the lysogenic phage is the one causing the damage, then the first half should have more plumes on strain B. But the data shows 40 plumes on B from the first half and 4 on K from the same half. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (which caused the damage) also caused double-strand breaks, making the phage more resistant to replication, allowing more infections, hence more plumes. But when only the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't cause any issues unless it's mutated further, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII. Wait, maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated within itself, causing a double-strand break, which the phage can repair, allowing it to replicate indefinitely. Therefore, in the presence of the lysogenic phage, it can cause more infections because it can handle the repair mechanism. So when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage can now cause more infections, leading to more plumes on strain B than just the lysogenic phage alone. In the first half, where both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage causes more damage, resulting in 40 plumes on B. In the second half, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't cause any issues unless it's already defective. Since the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, perhaps it can still cause replication without lysis, but the double-strand breaks may allow it to replicate better, causing more plumes. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated within the lysogenic phage, leading to more plasmid copies, which can then infect more cells, increasing the number of plumes. But the exact calculation here is needed. The formula for recombinant DNA in plasmids is p = (p1 + p2 - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, the number of plasmids is determined by the product of the copy numbers of the two phages. Each plume corresponds to a single replication event, so the total number of plumes depends on the number of times the two phages can combine and replicate within themselves. The probability of such a combination happening is related to the number of plasmids. However, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phages. If both mutations are in the same T4 phage, then the recombination rate would be zero because they're identical. But the problem states that they carry mutations in the same T4 genome, implying that they are different mutations. Therefore, the recombination would occur at a rate proportional to the frequency of double-strand breaks or the efficiency of repair. Alternatively, the presence of double-strand breaks due to the combination of the two phages indicates recombination. The number of plumes observed can help determine the efficiency of repair. If the lysogenic phage can repair its own plasmid, it won't cause as many plumes as when it combines with another phage. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing double-strand breaks, which require repair, leading to more plumes. The exact calculation involves determining the efficiency of repair and using it to find the recombination frequency. However, without detailed calculations, we can estimate that a high percentage of recombination occurs when the lysogenic phage causes double-strand breaks, indicating that the two mutations (the lysogenic and another mutation) have occurred within the same T4 phage. Given that the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, which allows it to replicate without lysis, but perhaps causing more plasmid copy numbers or more efficient replication, leading to more plumes when combined with another phage. The number of plumes can be used to calculate the probability of recombination. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 50% chance of causing double-strand breaks, the number of plumes would reflect that. Assuming each plume corresponds to a 50% chance, we can use the binomial distribution to find the recombination rate. However, without specific data, it's challenging to compute exactly. Alternatively, the presence of 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on B suggests that the lysogenic phage (with rII mutation) is responsible for most of the plumes on B, while the second half (strain K) shows fewer plumes, possibly because the lysogenic phage cannot efficiently cause double-strand breaks without additional mutations. Therefore, the recombination between the two mutations (lysofission and lysogeny) must have occurred, as evidenced by the increased plumes on B. To estimate the percentage, assuming that the recombination rate is high, say around 1%, which aligns with option A. Alternatively, given the number of plumes, the recombination efficiency can be calculated. For instance, if the lysogenic phage normally causes 80% of the plumes, and the second half shows 40 plumes, that would suggest a 50% decrease, indicating a 50% recombination. But that's speculative. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes relates to the square root of the number of plasmids. If the number of plumes on B is four times that on K, the square root of 4 is 2, suggesting a 2-fold difference in plasmid copy numbers. This might indicate a moderate level of recombination. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to pin down the exact percentage. Looking back at the options, 1% is too low; 2% is also low. 1.5%, 0.1%, etc., are all very small. Option F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%. Considering the significant increase in plumes on B, it's plausible that recombination is occurring at a moderate level, closer to 2% or slightly higher. Alternatively, the exact calculation might show that the recombination frequency is approximately 2%, matching option G. However, I'm unsure without more precise data. Another angle is that the presence of double-strand breaks implies recombination, and the number of plumes reflects the efficiency of repair. If the lysogenic phage can repair its own plasmids, it won't cause as many plumes. But since it's causing more plumes, it must have introduced double-strand breaks, requiring repair. The repair process could involve recombination, hence the recombination between the mutations would be higher. Given that the answer choices include 0.3% as G, but my earlier reasoning suggested 2%, which is not an option. Wait, looking back, the possible answers don't include 2%, so I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the number of plumes. The number of plumes on B is four times that on K (40 vs 10). Assuming the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of plumes, then the ratio of plasmids is sqrt(40/10) \u2248 2. So the lysogenic phage has twice as many plasmids as the lysogenic phage on K. This could indicate that recombination occurred, as the lysogenic phage on B inherited more plasmids through recombination. The recombination frequency is typically expressed as the percentage of offspring inheriting one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. However, without knowing the parent strains, it's tricky. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula for the probability of recombination, which is p = (p1 + p2 - 1)/2, where p1 and p2 are the frequencies of the alleles. But since we're dealing with plasmids, it's more about the proportion of plasmids. The exact calculation might not be straightforward, but considering the significant increase in plumes, recombination must have occurred at a moderate level. Among the options, 2% (option G) seems reasonable, despite my initial confusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The initial effect was that strain B was mainly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage might be causing issues. But wait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission, leading to cell death. So why would strain B be affected? Maybe it's because the lysogenic phage is combining with another mutation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated within the lysogenic phage, causing it to cause lytic fission even without a separate mutation elsewhere. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing the lysogenic fission, but the lysogenic fission leads to cell death, which could interact with another mutation elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the results again. When both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which makes sense because the lysogenic phage is the one doing the damage. However, the other half is plated on strain K. Strain K isn't mentioned as being affected, but the results showed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (from both mutants) is causing enough infections on strain B to result in 40 plumes, while on strain K, the presence of the lysogenic phage didn't lead to as many infections. Wait, no\u2014actually, the lysogenic phage should be the ones causing the issue on strain B. So when both types are present, the E. coli strain B has fewer plumes than the other half, which is expected because the lysogenic phage is the one causing damage. But the other half (strained K) wasn't affected much. Now, considering that the presence of multiple phages increases the likelihood of their combination causing new effects, like double-strand break repair. So when both phages are present, their combination might lead to double-strand breaks, which can be repaired inefficiently, leading to more infections and thus more plumes. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is interacting with another mutation, such as a mutation in the T4 locus that allows it to replicate within itself. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing the lysogenic fission, but its replication inside the phage leads to double-strand breaks, which can be repaired by the lysogenic phage, allowing it to survive longer. Then, when both phages are present, the lysogenic phage can cause more infections because it can now handle the repair mechanisms. This would increase the number of plumes on strain B compared to just the lysogenic phage alone. But according to the data, the lysogenic phage alone (only the first half?) resulted in a certain number of plumes, and when both are present, the second half shows a different number. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the halves. Let me clarify: the first half had both mutant phages, but only the lysogenic one caused the damage, resulting in 40 plumes on strain B. The second half had only the lysogenic phage, but when plated on strain K, it didn't affect much, showing 4 plumes on K. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if the lysogenic phage is the one causing the damage, then the first half should have more plumes on strain B. But the data shows 40 plumes on B from the first half and 4 on K from the same half. That suggests that the lysogenic phage (which caused the damage) also caused double-strand breaks, making the phage more resistant to replication, allowing more infections, hence more plumes. But when only the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't cause any issues unless it's mutated further, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII. Wait, maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated within itself, causing a double-strand break, which the phage can repair, allowing it to replicate indefinitely. Therefore, in the presence of the lysogenic phage, it can cause more infections because it can handle the repair mechanism. So when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage can now cause more infections, leading to more plumes on strain B than just the lysogenic phage alone. In the first half, where both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage causes more damage, resulting in 40 plumes on B. In the second half, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it shouldn't cause any issues unless it's already defective. Since the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, perhaps it can still cause replication without lysis, but the double-strand breaks may allow it to replicate better, causing more plumes. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated within the lysogenic phage, leading to more plasmid copies, which can then infect more cells, increasing the number of plumes. But the exact calculation here is needed. The formula for recombinant DNA in plasmids is p = (p1 + p2 - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, the number of plasmids is determined by the product of the copy numbers of the two phages. Each plume corresponds to a single replication event, so the total number of plumes depends on the number of times the two phages can combine and replicate within themselves. The probability of such a combination happening is related to the number of plasmids. However, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phages. If both mutations are in the same T4 phage, then the recombination rate would be zero because they're identical. But the problem states that they carry mutations in the same T4 genome, implying that they are different mutations. Therefore, the recombination would occur at a rate proportional to the frequency of double-strand breaks or the efficiency of repair. Alternatively, the presence of double-strand breaks due to the combination of the two phages indicates recombination. The number of plumes observed can help determine the efficiency of repair. If the lysogenic phage can repair its own plasmid, it won't cause as many plumes as when it combines with another phage. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing double-strand breaks, which require repair, leading to more plumes. The exact calculation involves determining the efficiency of repair and using it to find the recombination frequency. However, without detailed calculations, we can estimate that a high percentage of recombination occurs when the lysogenic phage causes double-strand breaks, indicating that the two mutations (the lysogenic and another mutation) have occurred within the same T4 phage. Given that the lysogenic phage has a mutation in rII, which allows it to replicate without lysis, but perhaps causing more plasmid copy numbers or more efficient replication, leading to more plumes when combined with another phage. The number of plumes can be used to calculate the probability of recombination. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 50% chance of causing double-strand breaks, the number of plumes would reflect that. Assuming each plume corresponds to a 50% chance, we can use the binomial distribution to find the recombination rate. However, without specific data, it's challenging to compute exactly. Alternatively, the presence of 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on B suggests that the lysogenic phage (with rII mutation) is responsible for most of the plumes on B, while the second half (strain K) shows fewer plumes, possibly because the lysogenic phage cannot efficiently cause double-strand breaks without additional mutations. Therefore, the recombination between the two mutations (lysofission and lysogeny) must have occurred, as evidenced by the increased plumes on B. To estimate the percentage, assuming that the recombination rate is high, say around 1%, which aligns with option A. Alternatively, given the number of plumes, the recombination efficiency can be calculated. For instance, if the lysogenic phage normally causes 80% of the plumes, and the second half shows 40 plumes, that would suggest a 50% decrease, indicating a 50% recombination. But that's speculative. Another approach is to consider that the number of plumes relates to the square root of the number of plasmids. If the number of plumes on B is four times that on K, the square root of 4 is 2, suggesting a 2-fold difference in plasmid copy numbers. This might indicate a moderate level of recombination. However, without precise calculations, it's hard to pin down the exact percentage. Looking back at the options, 1% is too low; 2% is also low. 1.5%, 0.1%, etc., are all very small. Option F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%. Considering the significant increase in plumes on B, it's plausible that recombination is occurring at a moderate level, closer to 2% or slightly higher. Alternatively, the exact calculation might show that the recombination frequency is approximately 2%, matching option G. However, I'm unsure without more precise data. Another angle is that the presence of double-strand breaks implies recombination, and the number of plumes reflects the efficiency of repair. If the lysogenic phage can repair its own plasmids, it won't cause as many plumes. But since it's causing more plumes, it must have introduced double-strand breaks, requiring repair. The repair process could involve recombination, hence the recombination between the mutations would be higher. Given that the answer choices include 0.3% as G, but my earlier reasoning suggested 2%, which is not an option. Wait, looking back, the possible answers don't include 2%, so I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the number of plumes. The number of plumes on B is four times that on K (40 vs 10). Assuming the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of plumes, then the ratio of plasmids is sqrt(40/10) \u2248 2. So the lysogenic phage has twice as many plasmids as the lysogenic phage on K. This could indicate that recombination occurred, as the lysogenic phage on B inherited more plasmids through recombination. The recombination frequency is typically expressed as the percentage of offspring inheriting one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. However, without knowing the parent strains, it's tricky. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula for the probability of recombination, which is p = (p1 + p2 - 1)/2, where p1 and p2 are the frequencies of the alleles. But since we're dealing with plasmids, it's more about the proportion of plasmids. The exact calculation might not be straightforward, but considering the significant increase in plumes, recombination must have occurred at a moderate level. Among the options, 2% (option G) seems reasonable, despite my initial confusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

That might indicate that their effects are additive or complementary. Now, the main part is figuring out the recombination frequency. Recombination refers to the probability that two different mutations occur in the same gene locus in related individuals. In phages, if two mutations interfere with each other's replication, they can either enhance or inhibit each other's activity. Here, since the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B but does affect strain K, perhaps their combination creates a synergistic effect where both mutations contribute to the lysogeny. This would suggest that the two mutations are not independent; they influence each other. To calculate recombination frequency, we usually look at the number of double mutants observed versus the expected number if the mutations are independent. However, in this case, it seems like the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to the lysogeny in strain K, while the lysic phage leads to its death in strain B. But when both are present, only the lysogenic affects B. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a certain degree of compatibility with the lysogenic origin of phages, and the lysic phage is incompatible. The recombination here could be quantified by considering the number of double mutants or whether the mutations interfere constructively or destructively. Alternatively, since the problem mentions \"amount of recombination,\" perhaps it's referring to the proportion of times both mutations occurred together in a way that affects the lysogeny. Let me try to model this. Suppose the two mutations are at positions R and S. When R occurs, it may disrupt the lysogenic origin. When S occurs, it enhances the lysogenic expression. Or vice versa. If R and S are recombined, then the resulting phage might have both mutations affecting the lysogeny differently. The experiment shows that when the lysogenic phage is present (with R), it doesn't affect strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause issues when interacting with another lysogenic phage. Conversely, when the lysic phage is present (with S), it kills strain B, indicating that the lysic phage might be causing an issue when it interacts with another lysogenic phage. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage (R) in the presence of the lysic phage (S) leads to lethality in strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage may have a positive effect when combined with the lysic phage. This suggests that the two mutations interfere constructively, meaning they work together to reduce the likelihood of infection. To find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Double Mutations + Number of Recombinant Phenotypes) / Total Number of Phages Plated\n\nBut wait, in this case, the experiment isn't directly measuring the frequency of mutations but rather seeing how the combinations affect the outcome. Since only the lysogenic phage caused issues in strain B, it implies that the lysogenic phage didn't interact negatively with another lysogenic phage. The lysic phage, on the other hand, killed strain B when present. So, the lysic phage probably enhances the lysogenic effect when it's present. This suggests that the two mutations interfere, leading to reduced susceptibility to infection. To quantify the recombination, we might consider that if the mutations were independent, we'd expect certain numbers, but the actual results show that when both mutations are present, it leads to less infection. If recombination increases the likelihood of interference, then the observed data supports a certain level of recombination. Given that the answer choices are percentages up to 5%, and considering the difference in outcomes between the two dilutions, perhaps the recombination frequency is low. Let me think about how the dilution factors relate to the concentrations. Dilution factor 1e7 means each well has 1e-7 of the total phages, so each bacterium has 1e-7 phages. Similarly, 1e5 means each bacterium has 1e-5 phages. The number of plumes (infections) depends on the number of phages per cell. Higher dilution factor means fewer cells are plated, so fewer phages per cell, making it harder for them to infect. So, if the lysogenic phage (R) is used alone, it might not cause issues in strain B because the lysogenic phage is compatible with the lysogenic origin. When combined with the lysic phage (S), it causes lethality. So the presence of R and S reduces the chance of infection. If recombination increased the negative effect, then the observed increase in plumes (since only the lysogenic phage affects B) would be due to the enhanced effect of R when combined with S. The exact calculation might involve using the chi-squared test or something similar, but given the options are percentages, perhaps it's simpler. The key point is that the lysogenic phage reduces the number of plumes in B compared to K. The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, in the first experiment, B is plated at 1e5, and K at 1e7. Since the number of plumes decreases as dilution factor increases, the number of plumes in K should be higher than in B. Indeed, the result was 40 plumes in B and 4 in K. Wait, no\u2014actually, higher dilution factor means fewer cells, so fewer phages per cell, which makes it harder for phages to infect. So, in the first plate (B), 1e5 phages per cell would lead to fewer plumes. But the result showed 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Wait, no\u2014the dilution factor is 1e7 for B and 1e5 for K. So, for K, each cell has 1e5 phages, which is fewer than 1e7. Therefore, in K, the chance of phage infecting is higher, so more plumes. But the result was 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 40 plumes on B (lower dilution factor) would mean fewer cells, so fewer phages per cell, leading to fewer plumes. But the result was fewer plumes on B, meaning more susceptibility. That aligns with the idea that the lysogenic phage (R) doesn't kill strain B, whereas the lysic phage (S) does. So, when both are present, the lysogenic phage (R) doesn't kill, but the lysic phage (S) does, which might lead to some interference. Now, to determine the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is the percentage of times two alleles from parents combine into one offspring allele instead of two. In phages, this often relates to the probability that two mutations occur in the same gene locus independently. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of double mutants would be low. However, in this experiment, since only the lysogenic phage affects B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage and the lysic phage interfere in a way that constructs a double mutant phenotype (infectivity in B, lethality in K). This interference is likely due to recombination, meaning that the two mutations are working together to reduce the risk of infection. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can compare the observed number of double mutants (which is zero here because only the lysogenic phage affects B) to the expected number if mutations were independent. However, without specific data on expected frequencies, it's tricky. Another approach is to calculate the ratio of double mutants to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. If the two mutations are independent, the probability of both occurring is p * q. If they're linked, it's p * q * r, where r is the coefficient of recombination. But since the result is zero double mutants, it implies that either the mutations don't occur together or the coefficient is very high (recombination). The possible answers include recombination frequencies ranging from 0.01% to 5%. Given that only the lysogenic phage affected B, and the lysic phage affected K, it suggests that the lysogenic phage and lysic phage interfere to some extent. The recombination frequency is likely low, around 0.01-0.05 percent. Looking at the options, E is 0.02 percent and F is 0.3 percent. Considering the possibility of error margins and rounding, 0.02 percent might be the closest. Therefore, the answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",

    "rollout": " Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage from the mutant type interacts with the lysogenic phage from strain K? Or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant) combines with another lysogenic phage from strain K to cause double multiplication or something else. \n\nWait, no, double multiplication would require both mutation types to be present, which isn't specified here. Instead, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, only some of the E. coli strains are affected. Specifically, half are plated on strain B's lawn (which should be mostly resistant unless the lysogenic phage from strain B is present), and the other half are on strain K's lawn. In the first group (strain B's lawn), 40 plumes were found, meaning 40% of the inoculum was infected. In the second group (strain K's lawn), 4 plumes were found, so 4% were infected. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K caused some reduction in the number of phages available on the strain B's lawn, reducing the infection rate. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant) is combining with another lysogenic phage from strain K, causing some kind of interaction where both mutations are present on the same phage particle. This might lead to a higher probability of infection because the phage has two mutations instead of one.\n\nThe key point here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic sequences within the same gene locus. In this case, the two mutations (mutant phage type) are being considered as separate loci. The likelihood of their combination depends on how often they occur together. If they don't recombine, then the effect would be additive; if they do recombine, the combined effect could be either synergistic (both mutations working together) or antagonistic (both mutations preventing the action).\n\nLooking at the experimental data, when both mutants are present, the infection rates differ between the two groups. On strain B's lawn, the infection rate was 40%, while on strain K's lawn, it was 4%. This indicates that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduced the number of phages available on the strain B's lawn, leading to a lower infection rate. Alternatively, the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain B may have been partially retained on some phage particles, allowing more phages to infect strain B's cells. However, since only 40% of the cells were infected on strain B's lawn, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B was more likely to remain on the phage particles, thus reducing the overall number of phages available for infection on the bacteria.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for interference, which measures the occurrence of double recombinants relative to expected. The formula is:\n\nReciprocal of (1 + (recombination fraction * (1 - recombination fraction)))\n\nBut given that the question provides specific numbers of plumes, maybe we can calculate the probability that a phage carries both mutations. If we assume that the two mutations are independent, the probability of a phage carrying both would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, mutations are often linked (recombined) rather than independent.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on strain B's lawn, the infection rate was higher (40%) compared to the control without any mutations (which would presumably be 100%), it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increased the number of phages available on strain B's lawn, thereby increasing the infection rate. That would imply that the lysogenic phage from strain K is compatible with the lysogenic phage from strain B, i.e., they recombine, allowing the phage to infect more bacteria. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage from strain B recombines with another lysogenic phage from strain K, that would increase the number of phages available on the bacteria, leading to a higher infection rate, which aligns with the observed 40%.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would depend on how often the two mutations occur together. If the recombination frequency is low, the two mutations would act independently, and the infection rates wouldn't show such a large difference. Therefore, a significant drop in the infection rate on strain B's lawn compared to the control suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K recombined with the lysogenic phage from strain B, lowering the number of phages available and thus the infection rate.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency using the data provided. The number of plumes on strain B's lawn was 40%, and on strain K's lawn, it was 4%. Assuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be 100%*(1 - r)^2, where r is the recombination frequency. However, in reality, if they recombine, the number of plumes would decrease.\n\nUsing the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (C.I.), which measures the correlation between the occurrence of two mutations, we can estimate the recombination frequency. C.I. = (observed / expected). Here, the observed number of plumes on strain K's lawn was 4, and on strain B's lawn, it was 40. Assuming independence, the expected number would be (100% - r)^2. Wait, actually, the expected number of plumes would be the square of (1 - r), assuming independence. But in our case, the observed number is 4 on K and 40 on B. Since 40 is much higher than expected under independence, it suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation reduces the number of phages available on strain B's cells, implying that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination.\n\nLet me try to compute the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination frequency (r) = 1 - sqrt((number of plumes on K)/(number of plumes on B))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nr = 1 - sqrt(4/40)\n= 1 - sqrt(0.1)\n\u2248 1 - 0.3162\n\u2248 0.6838 or 68.38%\n\nThat seems high, but given that the infection rate on strain B's lawn was significantly higher than expected under independence, the recombination must be quite frequent.\n\nHowever, wait, the calculation assumes that the two mutations are acting independently, which might not be the case. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the infection rates on the two plates.\n\nOn strain B's plate, the infection rate was 40%, and on strain K's plate, it was 4%. So, the ratio is 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation reduced the number of phages available on strain B's cells tenfold. If recombination occurred, the effect would be multiplicative rather than additive.\n\nAssuming that recombination leads to a multiplicative effect, the infection rate on strain B's plate would be proportional to (1 - r)^2 times the control rate. Similarly, on strain K's plate, it would be proportional to (1 - r)^2 times the control rate. However, the actual observed rates are 40% and 4%, respectively. If the control rate is 100%, then:\n\nFor strain B:\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 (1 - r) = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 r \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\n\nFor strain K:\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.04 \u2192 (1 - r) = 0.2 \u2192 r = 0.8\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the assumption of a multiplicative effect due to recombination may not hold, or perhaps the experiment accounts for such interactions differently. Alternatively, the reciprocal of the ratio gives an idea of the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes on strain K's plate is 4, and on strain B's plate, it's 40. The ratio is 10, suggesting that strain K's mutation effectively reduced the number of phages available on strain B's cells tenfold. If the recombination frequency is 36.75%, then the expected number of plumes would be (1 - 0.3675)^2 = (0.6325)^2 \u2248 0.4, matching the observed 40% on strain B's plate. On strain K's plate, the expected number would be (1 - 0.3675)^2 \u2248 0.4, but the observed is 4%, which is 10 times higher. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to consider that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduces the number of phages on strain B's cells, leading to a higher infection rate. If recombination occurs, the effective number of phages on strain B's cells decreases, making the infection rate higher. The exact relationship depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 1%, then the effective number of phages on strain B's cells would be less, increasing the infection rate. Let's see:\n\nEffective infection rate on strain B = 100% * (1 - r)^2 = 100% * (0.99)^2 \u2248 98%. But the observed rate is 40%, which is way too low. So 1% recombination seems incorrect.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 5%, then effective infection rate is 100% * (0.95)^2 \u2248 90.25%. Still too high compared to 40%.\n\nAt 10% recombination:\n(0.9)^2 = 81% \u2192 81% infection rate, still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 20% recombination:\n(0.8)^2 = 64% \u2192 Closer, but still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 25% recombination:\n(0.75)^2 = 56.25% \u2192 Closer, but still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 30% recombination:\n(0.7)^2 = 49% \u2192 Closest to 40%, but still higher.\n\nAt 35% recombination:\n(0.65)^2 \u2248 42.25% \u2192 Getting closer.\n\nAt 40% recombination:\n(0.6)^2 = 36% \u2192 Now below 40%.\n\nSo, the infection rate goes from 49% at 30% recombination to 36% at 40%. Our observation is 40%, which is just above 36%, suggesting that the recombination frequency is around 40%. But none of the options go up to 40%.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest option is F. 0.3 percent, and G. 0.5 percent. None are near 40%. So perhaps my initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduces the number of phages available on strain B's cells, indicating that the two mutations interact, perhaps the recombination frequency is very high. However, the answer options don't include frequencies close to 40-50%, so maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the experiment.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is the coefficient of coincidence, which is the ratio of observed over expected under independence. If the recombination frequency is 'r', then under independence, the expected number of plumes on strain K's plate would be (1 - r)^2 * expected plumes. But in reality, the observed number is 4, whereas under independence, if strain K's mutation didn't influence strain B's cells, it would have had a certain number. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should account for the fact that strain K's mutation is present on all plasmids, thus affecting the entire population.\n\nAnother angle: Since only the lysogenic phage from strain B causes damage, and the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increases the number of phages available on strain B's cells, perhaps the recombination frequency is high enough that the number of phages available on strain B's cells is reduced. If the recombination frequency is high, say 40%, then the number of phages on strain B's cells would be (1 - 0.4)^2 = 0.36, or 36% of the original. However, the observed infection rate on strain B's plate is 40%, which is higher than 36%. That doesn't make sense. It suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation is actually helping to reduce the number of phages, leading to a higher infection rate. So perhaps the recombination frequency is low, meaning the mutations are acting independently, but that contradicts the earlier observation.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nRecombinant fraction = 1 - sqrt( (Observed rate on K) / (Observed rate on B) )\n\nWhich would be 1 - sqrt(4/40) = 1 - sqrt(0.1) \u2248 1 - 0.316 = 0.684 or 68.4%. But again, this is high and not among the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombinant fraction = 1 - sqrt( (Observed rate on K) / (Observed rate on B) )\n\nBut that would give us the same result. Maybe I need to rethink.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increases the number of phages available on strain B's cells, which would suggest that the lysogenic phage from strain K is compatible with the lysogenic phage from strain B, leading to higher recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency would be relatively high.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest is F. 0.3 percent and G. 0.5 percent. These are very low, meaning little recombination. However, our calculation suggested a recombination frequency of approximately 68-70%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I've misapplied the formula.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the change in infection rates. The change from 40% to 4% suggests a significant reduction in phage availability on strain B's cells. If the recombination frequency is 'r,' then the number of plumes on strain B's plate would be (1 - r)^2 times the number expected under independence. Similarly, on strain K's plate, the number would be (1 - r)^2 times the number expected under independence. Given that the observed rates are 40% and 4%, and assuming the control rate is 100%, we can set up equations:\n\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.4 (for strain B)\nand\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.04 (for strain K)\n\nThese can't both be true unless the control rate varies, which it shouldn't. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the presence of strain K's mutation allows the lysogenic phage to infect more strain B's cells, leading to a higher infection rate. Thus, the recombination frequency must be high enough to make (1 - r)^2 multiply the control rate to reach 40% on strain B's plate and 4% on strain K's plate. But this requires solving for 'r' in both cases:\n\nFrom strain B: (1 - r)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 1 - r = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 r \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\nFrom strain K: (1 - r)^2 = 0.04 \u2192 1 - r = 0.2 \u2192 r = 0.8 or 80%\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the recombination frequency cannot satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the problem must lie elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency corresponds to the number of plumes observed, and the data points indicate that the majority of the recombination happened. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes on strain K's plate is 4, which is 10 times less than on strain B's plate (40 vs. 4), it implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduces the number of phages available on strain B's cells by a factor of 10. If recombination occurs, this would mean that the effective number of phages is reduced by a factor corresponding to the square root of 10, which is approximately 3.16. However, this line of reasoning also doesn't directly translate into a recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the confusion and lack of clarity in applying the formulas correctly, perhaps the intended answer is based on recognizing that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K leads to a higher infection rate on strain B's plate, indicating a high level of recombination. Among the answer choices, the highest is G. 0.5 percent, followed by F. 0.3 percent. Without further information, it's difficult to choose precisely, but based on the significant increase in the infection rate on strain B's plate, the recombination frequency must be high. Since the options don't include 70%, but the closest lower option is G. 0.5 percent, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the lysogenic phage from the mutant type interacts with the lysogenic phage from strain K? Or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant) combines with another lysogenic phage from strain K to cause double multiplication or something else. \n\nWait, no, double multiplication would require both mutation types to be present, which isn't specified here. Instead, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, only some of the E. coli strains are affected. Specifically, half are plated on strain B's lawn (which should be mostly resistant unless the lysogenic phage from strain B is present), and the other half are on strain K's lawn. In the first group (strain B's lawn), 40 plumes were found, meaning 40% of the inoculum was infected. In the second group (strain K's lawn), 4 plumes were found, so 4% were infected. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K caused some reduction in the number of phages available on the strain B's lawn, reducing the infection rate. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant) is combining with another lysogenic phage from strain K, causing some kind of interaction where both mutations are present on the same phage particle. This might lead to a higher probability of infection because the phage has two mutations instead of one.\n\nThe key point here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic sequences within the same gene locus. In this case, the two mutations (mutant phage type) are being considered as separate loci. The likelihood of their combination depends on how often they occur together. If they don't recombine, then the effect would be additive; if they do recombine, the combined effect could be either synergistic (both mutations working together) or antagonistic (both mutations preventing the action).\n\nLooking at the experimental data, when both mutants are present, the infection rates differ between the two groups. On strain B's lawn, the infection rate was 40%, while on strain K's lawn, it was 4%. This indicates that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduced the number of phages available on the strain B's lawn, leading to a lower infection rate. Alternatively, the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain B may have been partially retained on some phage particles, allowing more phages to infect strain B's cells. However, since only 40% of the cells were infected on strain B's lawn, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B was more likely to remain on the phage particles, thus reducing the overall number of phages available for infection on the bacteria.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for interference, which measures the occurrence of double recombinants relative to expected. The formula is:\n\nReciprocal of (1 + (recombination fraction * (1 - recombination fraction)))\n\nBut given that the question provides specific numbers of plumes, maybe we can calculate the probability that a phage carries both mutations. If we assume that the two mutations are independent, the probability of a phage carrying both would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, in reality, mutations are often linked (recombined) rather than independent.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on strain B's lawn, the infection rate was higher (40%) compared to the control without any mutations (which would presumably be 100%), it suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increased the number of phages available on strain B's lawn, thereby increasing the infection rate. That would imply that the lysogenic phage from strain K is compatible with the lysogenic phage from strain B, i.e., they recombine, allowing the phage to infect more bacteria. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage from strain B recombines with another lysogenic phage from strain K, that would increase the number of phages available on the bacteria, leading to a higher infection rate, which aligns with the observed 40%.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would depend on how often the two mutations occur together. If the recombination frequency is low, the two mutations would act independently, and the infection rates wouldn't show such a large difference. Therefore, a significant drop in the infection rate on strain B's lawn compared to the control suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K recombined with the lysogenic phage from strain B, lowering the number of phages available and thus the infection rate.\n\nNow, calculating the recombination frequency using the data provided. The number of plumes on strain B's lawn was 40%, and on strain K's lawn, it was 4%. Assuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would be 100%*(1 - r)^2, where r is the recombination frequency. However, in reality, if they recombine, the number of plumes would decrease.\n\nUsing the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (C.I.), which measures the correlation between the occurrence of two mutations, we can estimate the recombination frequency. C.I. = (observed / expected). Here, the observed number of plumes on strain K's lawn was 4, and on strain B's lawn, it was 40. Assuming independence, the expected number would be (100% - r)^2. Wait, actually, the expected number of plumes would be the square of (1 - r), assuming independence. But in our case, the observed number is 4 on K and 40 on B. Since 40 is much higher than expected under independence, it suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation reduces the number of phages available on strain B's cells, implying that the two mutations are interacting, possibly through recombination.\n\nLet me try to compute the recombination frequency using the formula:\n\nRecombination frequency (r) = 1 - sqrt((number of plumes on K)/(number of plumes on B))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nr = 1 - sqrt(4/40)\n= 1 - sqrt(0.1)\n\u2248 1 - 0.3162\n\u2248 0.6838 or 68.38%\n\nThat seems high, but given that the infection rate on strain B's lawn was significantly higher than expected under independence, the recombination must be quite frequent.\n\nHowever, wait, the calculation assumes that the two mutations are acting independently, which might not be the case. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the infection rates on the two plates.\n\nOn strain B's plate, the infection rate was 40%, and on strain K's plate, it was 4%. So, the ratio is 40/4 = 10. This suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation reduced the number of phages available on strain B's cells tenfold. If recombination occurred, the effect would be multiplicative rather than additive.\n\nAssuming that recombination leads to a multiplicative effect, the infection rate on strain B's plate would be proportional to (1 - r)^2 times the control rate. Similarly, on strain K's plate, it would be proportional to (1 - r)^2 times the control rate. However, the actual observed rates are 40% and 4%, respectively. If the control rate is 100%, then:\n\nFor strain B:\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 (1 - r) = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 r \u2248 1 - 0.6325 \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\n\nFor strain K:\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.04 \u2192 (1 - r) = 0.2 \u2192 r = 0.8\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the assumption of a multiplicative effect due to recombination may not hold, or perhaps the experiment accounts for such interactions differently. Alternatively, the reciprocal of the ratio gives an idea of the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes on strain K's plate is 4, and on strain B's plate, it's 40. The ratio is 10, suggesting that strain K's mutation effectively reduced the number of phages available on strain B's cells tenfold. If the recombination frequency is 36.75%, then the expected number of plumes would be (1 - 0.3675)^2 = (0.6325)^2 \u2248 0.4, matching the observed 40% on strain B's plate. On strain K's plate, the expected number would be (1 - 0.3675)^2 \u2248 0.4, but the observed is 4%, which is 10 times higher. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to consider that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduces the number of phages on strain B's cells, leading to a higher infection rate. If recombination occurs, the effective number of phages on strain B's cells decreases, making the infection rate higher. The exact relationship depends on the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 1%, then the effective number of phages on strain B's cells would be less, increasing the infection rate. Let's see:\n\nEffective infection rate on strain B = 100% * (1 - r)^2 = 100% * (0.99)^2 \u2248 98%. But the observed rate is 40%, which is way too low. So 1% recombination seems incorrect.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is 5%, then effective infection rate is 100% * (0.95)^2 \u2248 90.25%. Still too high compared to 40%.\n\nAt 10% recombination:\n(0.9)^2 = 81% \u2192 81% infection rate, still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 20% recombination:\n(0.8)^2 = 64% \u2192 Closer, but still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 25% recombination:\n(0.75)^2 = 56.25% \u2192 Closer, but still higher than 40%.\n\nAt 30% recombination:\n(0.7)^2 = 49% \u2192 Closest to 40%, but still higher.\n\nAt 35% recombination:\n(0.65)^2 \u2248 42.25% \u2192 Getting closer.\n\nAt 40% recombination:\n(0.6)^2 = 36% \u2192 Now below 40%.\n\nSo, the infection rate goes from 49% at 30% recombination to 36% at 40%. Our observation is 40%, which is just above 36%, suggesting that the recombination frequency is around 40%. But none of the options go up to 40%.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, the highest option is F. 0.3 percent, and G. 0.5 percent. None are near 40%.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should account for the fact that strain K's mutation is present on all plasmids, thus affecting the entire population.\n\nAnother angle: Since only the lysogenic phage from strain B causes damage, and the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increases the number of phages available on strain B's cells, perhaps the recombination frequency is high enough that the number of phages available on strain B's cells is reduced. If the recombination frequency is high, say 40%, then the number of phages on strain B's cells would be (1 - 0.4)^2 = 0.36, or 36% of the original. However, the observed infection rate on strain B's plate is 40%, which is higher than 36%. That doesn't make sense. It suggests that the presence of strain K's mutation is actually helping to reduce the number of phages, leading to a higher infection rate. So perhaps the recombination frequency is low, meaning the mutations are acting independently, but that contradicts the earlier observation.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\nRecombinant fraction = 1 - sqrt( (Observed rate on K) / (Observed rate on B) )\n\nWhich would be 1 - sqrt(4/40) = 1 - sqrt(0.1) \u2248 1 - 0.316 = 0.684 or 68.4%. But again, this is high and not among the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombinant fraction = 1 - sqrt( (Observed rate on K) / (Observed rate on B) )\n\nBut that would give us the same result. Maybe I need to rethink.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K increases the number of phages available on strain B's cells, which would suggest that the lysogenic phage from strain K is compatible with the lysogenic phage from strain B, leading to higher recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency would be relatively high.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest is F. 0.3 percent and G. 0.5 percent. These are very low, meaning little recombination. However, our calculation suggested a recombination frequency of approximately 68-70%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I've misapplied the formula.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the change in infection rates. The change from 40% to 4% suggests a significant reduction in phage availability on strain B's cells. If the recombination frequency is 'r,' then the number of plumes on strain B's plate would be (1 - r)^2 times the number expected under independence. Similarly, on strain K's plate, the number would be (1 - r)^2 times the number expected under independence. Given that the observed rates are 40% and 4%, and assuming the control rate is 100%, we can set up equations:\n\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.4 (for strain B)\nand\n(1 - r)^2 = 0.04 (for strain K)\n\nThese can't both be true unless the control rate varies, which it shouldn't. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the presence of strain K's mutation allows the lysogenic phage to infect more strain B's cells, leading to a higher infection rate. Thus, the recombination frequency must be high enough to make (1 - r)^2 multiply the control rate to reach 40% on strain B's plate and 4% on strain K's plate. But this requires solving for 'r' in both cases:\n\nFrom strain B: (1 - r)^2 = 0.4 \u2192 1 - r = sqrt(0.4) \u2248 0.6325 \u2192 r \u2248 0.3675 or 36.75%\nFrom strain K: (1 - r)^2 = 0.04 \u2192 1 - r = 0.2 \u2192 r = 0.8 or 80%\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the recombination frequency cannot satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the problem must lie elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency corresponds to the number of plumes observed, and the data points indicate that the majority of the recombination happened. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed number of plumes on strain K's plate is 4, which is 10 times less than on strain B's plate (40 vs. 4), it implies that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K reduces the number of phages available on strain B's cells by a factor of 10. If recombination occurs, this would mean that the effective number of phages is reduced by a factor corresponding to the square root of 10, which is approximately 3.16. However, this line of reasoning also doesn't directly translate into a recombination frequency.\n\nGiven the confusion and lack of clarity in applying the formulas correctly, perhaps the intended answer is based on recognizing that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K leads to a higher infection rate on strain B's plate, indicating a high level of recombination. Among the answer choices, the highest is G. 0.5 percent, followed by F. 0.3 percent. Without further information, it's difficult to choose precisely, but based on the significant increase in the infection rate on strain B's plate, the recombination frequency must be high. Since the options don't include 70%, but the closest lower option is G. 0.5 percent, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.

A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe key here is the concept of cross-resistance or cross-infection. Cross-infection occurs when different phages from different species infect the same bacterial cell. In this case, the lysogenic phage might integrate its mutation into the T_4 genome, allowing it to cause lysis. However, since only the lysogenic phage was causing issues in strain B, it must be that their mutations interfere. \n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage should not cause lysis. Unless the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate inside the lysogenic particle without lysis. That would allow it to lyse the entire E. coli cell, including the phage. But wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage does cause lytic fission, meaning it dies upon replication. Oh, right! Because lysogenic phages typically don't lyse the cell; they just integrate their DNA and live for a longer time. So if there's a mutation in the lysogenic phage that allows it to replicate without lysing the cell, then it could cause lytic fission. Similarly, the lysogenic phage may carry a mutation that makes it integrate into the T_4 genome, disrupting its ability to replicate. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that prevents it from replicating inside the lysogenic particle, leading to its death upon replication, thus causing lysis. \n\nBut the problem says that the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, implying it doesn't lyse the cell. Therefore, any mutation in the lysogenic phage that affects its ability to replicate within the lysogenic particle would lead to its death upon replication, resulting in lysis. This would explain why strain B (which has the lysogenic phage type) gets affected, while strain K (with a different mutation) doesn't. So the mutation in the lysogenic phage likely interferes with its replication within the lysogenic particle, causing it to die upon replication, leading to lysis of the host cell.\n\nNow, regarding the experimental results. When both mutantphages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, indicating that the lysogenic phage has caused a problem. When the culture is split into two groups: one at 1:1e7 (lower concentration, fewer cells) and one at 1:1e5 (higher concentration, more cells), the number of plumes (infections) differs. Strain B shows 40 plumes, while strain K shows 4. The ratio of plumes suggests something about the likelihood of the mutations occurring together. \n\nIn experiments where multiple phages are present, the presence of a second phage often increases the probability of co-infection because the first phage selection removes some cells. The ratio of plumes can help determine the degree of genetic interaction between the two mutations. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of plumes would follow a Poisson distribution, and the variance would equal the expectation. However, if there's some linkage or interference, the observed variance would differ.\n\nGiven that the strain B group had significantly more plumes (40 vs. 4), it suggests that the mutations in the lysogenic phage are less likely to occur independently in strain B. This could indicate that there's some degree of recombination or interference between the two mutations. The exact calculation would involve determining the likelihood of the mutations interacting, which relates to the recombination frequency.\n\nRecombination frequency measures the proportion of times two genes interact in crossing over. It's usually expressed as a percentage. In this context, it refers to the likelihood that the two mutations in the T_4 phage genome are linked, affecting whether the lysogenic phage can replicate and cause lysis.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we consider the number of co-occurrences of the two mutations. If the mutations are linked, they tend to occur together more frequently than random chance. The formula for recombination frequency (RF) is:\n\nRF = [ (number of co-occurring mutants) / (total possible co-occurrences) ] * 100%\n\nIn this scenario, when both mutantphages are present, the total number of plumes (infections) depends on the likelihood of the mutations being in the same chromosome. If the mutations are in the same orientation, they increase the likelihood of co-infection. If they're in different orientations, they decrease this likelihood.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n- Strain B (mutant lysogenic phage): 40 plumes.\n- Strain K (no lysogenic phage, assuming it's a different mutation): 4 plumes.\n\nIf the mutations were in the same orientation, we'd expect more co-infections because both mutations would be present in the same cell. Conversely, if they were in different orientations, fewer co-infections would occur.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are in the same orientation, the expected number of co-infections would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. However, since we have specific numbers, we can use the ratio of plumes to estimate RF.\n\nThe ratio of plumes between the two strains (strain B:40, strain K:4) indicates that strain B has much more co-infection activity than strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage mutation is more likely to occur in strain B compared to strain K. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the following approach: the observed number of co-infections (strain B:40, strain K:4) implies that the mutations are somewhat dependent. The formula for RF in terms of plume counts is:\n\nRF = (number of co-infections) / (total number of possible co-infections)\n\nTotal possible co-infections would be the sum of plumes from both strains, but considering the probabilities. However, a simpler way is to assume that the number of co-infections reflects the likelihood of the mutations being in the same orientation. \n\nGiven the numbers, strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4. The ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the mutation in strain B is more likely to occur in the same location as the mutation in strain K, implying a high degree of linkage or recombination. \n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency is often reported as a percentage. For example, 1% recombination would mean that 1% of the time, the two mutations are in different orientations, reducing the likelihood of co-infection.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA. 1%\nB. 2%\nC. 1.5%\nD. 0.1%\nE. 0.05%\nF. 0.03%\nG. 0.5%\nH. 5%\nI. 0.02%\nJ. 0.05%\nK. 0.08%\n\nSo, the correct answer should correspond to the calculated recombination frequency. Given the high number of plumes in strain B relative to strain K, it's likely that the recombination frequency is relatively high. However, looking at the ratio of plumes, 40:4 reduces to 10:1, which corresponds to approximately 96% co-infection, suggesting a very low recombination frequency. But none of the options go that high. Instead, the closest option is H. 5%, which seems plausible but still not extremely high. Alternatively, J. 0.05% and K. 0.08% are even lower.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the likelihood of the mutations occurring together. The number of co-infections suggests that the two mutations are somewhat dependent. Using the formula for RF in terms of plume counts:\n\nRF = (number of co-infections) / (total possible co-infections)\n\nTotal possible co-infections would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. But given the data, it's more straightforward to consider the ratio of plumes as indicative of the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother method is to use the formula:\n\nRF = (c1 + c2 - c_total) / c_total\n\nWhere c1 and c2 are the counts of each mutation, and c_total is the total number of cells plated. But this might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, using the chi-squared test for goodness of fit to see if the observed co-infections fit a model of independence. If the observed co-infections are significantly higher than expected under independence, it suggests a positive correlation (recombination).\n\nGiven the high number of plumes in strain B, it's likely that the recombination frequency is significant but not extremely high. Among the options, H.5% and J.0.05% are the smallest, but the numbers suggest otherwise. Maybe I'm missing a better approach.\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that when both mutantphages are present, the strain with more plumes likely has more susceptible cells, implying a higher likelihood of recombination. Since strain B has 40 plumes and strain K has 4, it's nearly four times as susceptible to the lysogenic phage. This suggests that the mutation in the lysogenic phage in strain B is more likely to occur in the same location as the mutation in strain K, indicating a high degree of linkage. \n\nHowever, the options don't include 96% or similar. The next best option is H.5%, which is quite high but still less than 96%. Alternatively, J.0.05% is almost negligible. Perhaps I should reconsider my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The number of plumes can also give insight into the effectiveness of the mutations. If the lysogenic phage's mutation leads to a higher likelihood of replication, then it would lyse more cells. Strain B shows more plumes, so maybe the lysogenic phage's mutation is more effective, leading to more plumes. However, if the lysogenic phage's mutation disrupts its ability to replicate, it wouldn't lyse the cell, so fewer plumes. \n\nIn the experiment, strain B is mostly affected, which supports the idea that the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to replicate inside the lysogenic particle without lysis, hence causing lysis of the entire cell. Therefore, strain B, which has the lysogenic phage, responds to this mutation, leading to more plumes. On the other hand, strain K doesn't have this mutation, so it's unaffected, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is determined by how often these two mutations occur together. Given the experimental results, the recombination frequency is likely around 5%, as it's the highest among the small percentages. So the answer should be H.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

In the second half, with a higher dilution (1e5), more phages would be present, leading to more infections, hence more plumes on strain K. Now, the number of plumes on K is four, while on B it's 40. Since plumes indicate successful infections, more plumes suggest higher concentrations of phages. This might relate to the idea of selection: if certain phages are selected, their presence affects the outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the combination of mutations leads to increased selection pressure, causing the phages to dominate. The key here is likely the concept of recombinant plasmids, where two different mutations in a phage gene recombine, creating a new variant. In experiments like this, the ratio of successful infections can help determine the frequency of such recombinations. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect random distribution, but with recombination, you'd see specific patterns. The number of plumes depends on the fitness of the phage mutants. If the lysogenic phage (which should lyse) combines with another mutation, maybe its fitness changes. If the combined phage is less fit, it would not survive as much, potentially reducing its proportion in the population. However, in the results, since only strain B was affected in the first half, that suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't do anything, implying no recombination occurred. But wait, the results show four plumes on K and 40 on B. That seems contradictory because if there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should not affect strain B. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the role of recombination here. Perhaps it's about whether the lysogenic phage can coexist with the lysogenic wild type, but that's not relevant. Alternatively, maybe the experiment measures the effect of combining both mutantphages, and the number of plumes reflects the competition between them. If the lysogenic phage (mutant) has a higher fitness (because it doesn't lyse), then it should dominate. But here, on strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, meaning the other mutantphage (the one that does lyse) wasn't present? Or did it get selected against? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this methodically. \n\nIn the initial experiment, the T_4 phage is only lysogenic, right? Because it doesn't lyse E. coli. Then, when mixed with mutantphages, maybe the lysogenic phage can't handle both types, causing it to die or lyse. But the problem states that the lysogenic phage does cause lysis in strain B. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; it just replicates. So if the lysogenic phage is mixed with the lysogenic phage mutant, perhaps the lysogenic phage can't replicate properly, leading to it dying. On the other hand, if there's a combination of lysogenic and another phage mutant, maybe the combination kills the phage, causing the E. coli to lyse. But in the first case, when only lysogenic is present, it doesn't lyse. So if the lysogenic is mixed with a mutant that can lyse, that would kill the phage. But in the first case, only lysogenic is present, so why did strain B die? Oh, because the lysogenic phage can't lyse, so mixing it with the lysogenic phage mutant (which could lyse) would cause the lysogenic phage to die, leading to the E. coli being lysed. Therefore, in the first half, with only lysogenic phage, mixing with lysogenic mutant leads to death, but in reality, the E. coli died, so that makes sense. Then, in the second half, with a higher dilution, more phages are present, so more lysogenic phages are present. Now, if the lysogenic phage can't handle both mutant types, it might lyse the E. coli. But in the first half, only lysogenic phage was present, so it couldn't lyse. In the second half, with a higher dilution, more lysogenic phages are present, so more of them would lyse, leading to more E. coli deaths. But the result shows four plumes on K and 40 on B. Since K is the strain being tested, and B is the control. Wait, the plate is split: half on strain B's lawn, half on strain K's lawn. If the lysogenic phage (from the first half) is present, it would lyse B, killing the bacteria, so in the B half, you wouldn't see many plumes because the lysogenic phage killed all the E. coli. Instead, you'd see plumes from the other half, which was on strain K's lawn. So if the lysogenic phage is present in the first half, only the second half (on K) would have plumes, indicating that the lysogenic phage killed the B strain. Similarly, if the lysogenic phage had been mixed with another phage mutant that could lyse, then both strains would die, resulting in fewer plumes overall. But in the first case, only B died, meaning the lysogenic phage didn't lyse any E. coli in the first half. In the second half, when there are more phages, more lysogenic phages would lyse B, but also, if there's a combination, maybe some lysogenic phages are left, leading to some B plumes. However, according to the results, only K has plumes. That suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't lyse B, so it must have been mixed with a phage mutant that couldn't lyse, meaning it caused B to die. But in the second half, more phages are present, so more lysogenic phages are present, leading to more plumes on K. Wait, but if the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse, then adding more phages shouldn't cause more B deaths. Maybe instead, the lysogenic phage can only lyse if it's compatible with the phage mutant. For example, if the lysogenic phage can only lyse when paired with a particular mutant, then mixing them would kill the phage, leading to B being lysed. However, if the lysogenic phage can't lyse alone, then mixing it with another phage mutant that can lyse would kill the phage, leading to B being lysed. But in the first case, only B died, so perhaps the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse, and mixing it with a lysogenic mutant led to it being killed, but mixing it with a non-lyser mutant didn't. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage can only lyse when paired with a specific mutant, making it recombine with the mutant, creating a recombinant phage that isn't as effective. This would explain why in the first half, only B died, but in the second half, more lysogenic phages are present, leading to more plumes on K. But how does this relate to recombination frequency?\n\nThe number of plumes can indicate the number of phage clones or the degree of competition. If the lysogenic phage can only lyse when paired with another phage mutant, this creates a situation where the lysogenic phage cannot lyse on its own, so it dies. However, when another phage mutant is present, it can lyse the lysogenic phage, causing it to die, leading to B being lysed. But in the first case, only B died, which suggests that the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse on its own. When mixed with another phage mutant, it can lyse, leading to B being lysed. But in the second case, with more phages, more lysogenic phages are present, so more plumes on K. If the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse, mixing it with another phage mutant would kill it, leading to fewer plumes on K. But in this case, it's the opposite\u2014more plumes on K. So maybe the lysogenic phage can lyse when paired with a specific mutant, but not when alone. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can lyse when it's mixed with another phage mutant that has a mutation in a different region. This would create a recombinant phage that can lyse the lysogenic phage. The more recombinants there are, the more they can lyse the lysogenic phage, leading to more plumes on K. But how does this relate to the recombination frequency?\n\nRecombination frequency refers to the percentage of homologous recombined genes in a given region. If two mutations are recombined, the likelihood of recombination increases. In experiments involving phages, the recombination of mutations in the T_4 phage can lead to changes in their activity. Recombination typically occurs at a low frequency unless conditions are strongly favorable. So if the recombination rate is high, you would expect more recombinant variants, which would influence the plasmid load. But in our experiment, we're seeing that in the first half, only B died, meaning the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse on its own. In the second half, with more phages, more lysogenic phages are present, leading to more plumes on K. If the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse alone, having more of them would increase the chance of them lyse, leading to more plumes on K. But the difference in numbers is small\u2014only four vs. 40. That suggests that the recombination frequency is low. If recombination happened frequently, you might expect more variation, but here the numbers are similar. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage requires a specific mutant to lyse it, leading to recombination. But I'm not sure. Another angle is to consider the number of plumes as a measure of the number of viable offspring. If the lysogenic phage can't lyse alone, it must have been recombined with another phage mutant to become a recombinant phage that can lyse it. The number of recombinant phages would depend on their ability to lyse. If the recombination is efficient, you'd have more recombinants, leading to more lyosability, more plumes on K. But in the data, only four on K and 40 on B. If B is the control and K is the test, and the lysogenic phage is not recombining, then the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse B, leading to more plumes on K. But in the first scenario, only B died, which would correspond to no recombination because the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse B on its own. In the second scenario, with more phages, the lysogenic phage becomes more abundant, leading to more plumes on K because the lysogenic phage can now lyse K's E. coli, causing more plumes. However, this doesn't directly tell us about recombination frequency. Recombination frequency would affect the total number of recombinant phages, which in turn affects the number of plumes. If recombination is frequent, you'd have more recombinant phages, leading to more plumes on K. But in this case, only four on K and 40 on B. Since the lysogenic phage couldn't lyse B on its own, it implies that it's not recombining, meaning recombination frequency is low. Therefore, the answer would be the lowest possible option, which is G. 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The fact that only strain B was affected in the first half (diluted 1e7) indicates that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues because it was either neutralized or combined. In the second half, with a higher dilution (1e5), more phages would be present, leading to more infections, hence more plumes on strain K. Now, the number of plumes on K is four, while on B it's 40. Since plumes indicate successful infections, more plumes suggest higher concentrations of phages. This might relate to the idea of selection: if certain phages are selected, their presence affects the outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the combination of mutations leads to increased selection pressure, causing the phages to dominate. The key here is likely the concept of recombinant plasmids, where two different mutations in a phage gene recombine, creating a new variant. In experiments like this, the ratio of successful infections can help determine the frequency of such recombinations. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect random distribution, but with recombination, you'd see specific patterns. The number of plumes depends on the fitness of the phage mutants. If the lysogenic phage (which should lyse) combines with another mutation, maybe its fitness changes. If the combined phage is less fit, it would not survive as much, potentially reducing its proportion in the population. However, in the results, since only strain B was affected in the first half, that suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't do anything, implying no recombination occurred. But wait, the results show four plumes on K and 40 on B. That seems contradictory because if there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should not affect strain B. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the role of recombination here. Perhaps it's about whether the lysogenic phage can coexist with the lysogenic wild type, but that's not relevant. Alternatively, maybe the experiment measures the effect of combining both mutantphages, and the number of plumes reflects the competition between them. If the lysogenic phage (mutant) has a higher fitness (because it doesn't lyse), then it should dominate. But here, on strain B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, meaning the other mutantphage (the one that does lyse) wasn't present? Or did it get selected against? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Since strain B is mainly affected, perhaps the lysogenic phages don't kill all the bacteria, but maybe some combination occurs. Alternatively, maybe one phage type is dominant in certain conditions, leading to different outcomes. \n\nThe key here is the number of plumes. Plumes occur when phages cause lysogeny, leading to lysogenic phage infection. Each plume corresponds to an infection. If both mutation types are present, and their effects interact, the total number of plumes would depend on how they interfere. For example, if a lysogenic phage interferes with another mutation, it might reduce the effectiveness of both. Conversely, if they work together, maybe the combined effect increases the number of plumes.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes. Strain K seems to be more susceptible, meaning that in the presence of lysogenic phages, strain K doesn't get as much infection. This could indicate that the lysogenic phages are effective against strain B but not against strain K. Alternatively, it could mean that strain K has a mutation that prevents the lysogenic phages from causing issues. \n\nWait, no. Actually, in the first case, only lysogenic phages are present, and they cause strain B to die. In the second case, both mutation types are present. So the lysogenic phages should still be able to cause strain B to die, but perhaps in combination with the other mutation? Or maybe the other mutation (the non-lytic phage) affects the lysogenic ones differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to more efficient lysogenic phage activity, but I'm not sure. Another angle is to consider the probability of each mutation occurring independently. If there's complete independence, the expected number of plumes would be additive. However, in reality, there's usually some interference between mutations. For instance, if a lysogenic phage integrates into the prophage DNA, it might disrupt the lysogenic machinery or interfere with the replication process, reducing the efficacy. Similarly, a non-lytic phage might affect the lysogenic phage by interfering with their replication.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, we're seeing that on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death, while on strain K, only the non-lytic phages do. That suggests that the non-lytic phages are effective against strain B but not against strain K. Or perhaps the opposite\u2014strain K is resistant to the lysogenic phage but susceptible to the non-lytic one. No, actually, the phages themselves are different. The lysogenic phages cause the lysogenic cycle, while the non-lytic ones cause the lytic cycle. So if the lysogenic phages are present, they cause the lysogenic infection, killing the bacteria. If the non-lytic phages are present, they cause the lytic infection, which might lead to lysogeny disruption or resistance.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage kills E. coli strain B, while the non-lytic phage doesn't. So in the first case, only the lysogenic phages are present. In the second case, both are present. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strain B is partially killed, but only 40% of the time. That suggests that the presence of both phages reduces the overall effectiveness of the lysogenic phages. Perhaps the non-lytic phages are interfering with the lysogenic phages by disrupting their replication or integrating into their prophage DNA, thereby reducing their efficiency in causing lysogeny.\n\nIn terms of recombination, if the two mutations are independent, the probability that a bacterium carries both mutations would be the product of their individual probabilities. But here, the presence of both mutations reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, indicating some form of interaction rather than independent events. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages, which allows them to integrate their prophages into each other's DNA. This can disrupt the lysogenic machinery or replication processes, making the phage less effective.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked through recombination, it would increase the chance of their simultaneous occurrence, potentially affecting the efficacy of lysogeny. But in this case, the problem is about calculating the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. To calculate that, we might need to look at the probabilities of each mutation occurring and then determine the likelihood of their co-occurrence.\n\nAssuming that each mutation has a certain frequency in the population, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the non-lytic phage. The frequency of recombinant individuals would be approximately pq. But since the problem provides specific numbers of plumes, maybe we can infer the relative frequencies of the mutations.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact frequencies of each mutation, it's tricky. Maybe we can use the ratio of plumes to estimate the relative frequencies. Since on strain B, there are 40 plumes and on strain K, there are 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the presence of lysogenic phages is ten times more likely on strain B than on strain K. This implies that the lysogenic phage's presence is more prevalent on strain B, which might suggest that the lysogenic phage confers some advantage or susceptibility to strain B.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination would make the two mutations appear together more often. If recombination occurred, the chance of both mutations being present in a bacterium would be higher. Without recombination, the mutations would be independent, so the probability would be p*q.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the amount of recombination. It's possible that the presence of both mutations is due to some form of integration or interference, which would increase the likelihood of both mutations being present together, thus increasing the efficacy of lysogeny. Recombination typically enhances the efficiency of integration, so if there's recombination, the two mutations would be more likely to coexist, leading to better lysogeny.\n\nGiven that, if the two mutations are linked through recombination, the recombination rate would be significant. To quantify this, we might assume that the presence of both mutations is due to recombination, and calculate the percentage of the population where both mutations coexist. But without actual data on allele frequencies, it's challenging. However, the observed reduction in lysogeny suggests that the two mutations are interacting, possibly due to recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes if the mutations were independent. If the probability of a bacterium carrying both mutations is p*q, and assuming the total number of bacteria is N, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to p*q*N. However, without knowing N, it's hard to compute exact values.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes (40 vs. 4), it's about a 10:1 ratio, suggesting that the presence of lysogenic phages is ten times more common on strain B. This could imply that the lysogenic phage is advantageous in some way, such as providing a selective advantage, allowing it to dominate over the non-lytic phage, which might be less fit or resistant.\n\nBut going back to recombination. Recombination typically occurs at low rates unless strong selection pressures are applied. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations is observed, implying that some degree of recombination exists. Given that the two mutations are present in different proportions across the population, the recombination rate must account for the difference in their frequencies.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage (p) is higher on strain B, and the non-lytic phage (q) is also higher on strain B but not on strain K. If recombination is occurring, the combined frequency (p + q - r), where r is the recombination frequency, would give us the actual frequency of both mutations together.\n\nHowever, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the plume counts again. On strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4 plumes. Since the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain B, perhaps the recombination is happening such that the presence of both mutations is more frequent on strain B. Recombination would create a new phage type that combines the features of both, potentially enhancing their ability to infect. If recombination is high, the two mutations are more likely to coexist, leading to higher plume counts on strain B.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can compare the observed plume distribution to what would be expected under independent mutation. If recombination were absent, the expected number of plumes would be lower because the two mutations would act independently. With recombination, the number would be higher because they are integrated.\n\nGiven that, the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain B, which suggests that recombination is occurring. The amount of recombination needed to explain the observed plume distribution can be estimated. But without knowing the exact mutation frequencies, it's challenging.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutations is due to some form of interference. If the two mutations are linked through recombination, they might interfere with each other's effects. For example, a lysogenic phage may interfere with the replication of the non-lytic phage, reducing their effectiveness. This would decrease the number of plumes caused by the non-lytic phage, hence fewer plumes on strain B. Similarly, the lysogenic phage might interfere with the replication of the lysogenic phage itself, but I'm not sure how that would affect the plume count directly.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of both mutations might be due to some chromosomal integration process, like transduction or conjugation, where the prophages integrate into each other's DNA. This would allow the integration of one phage's genes into another, potentially disrupting their function. This could enhance the lysogenic activity of the phage, making it more effective at causing lysogeny, thus leading to more plumes on strain B.\n\nIn summary, given that the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain B, and the presence of both mutations leads to reduced plume count on strain B, it suggests that recombination is occurring between the two mutations. The amount of recombination needed to explain the observed plume distribution would correspond to a moderate level. Looking at the options, D is 0.05%, which is quite low, F is 0.3%, which is moderate, and G is 0.5%. Since the plume ratio is 10:1, which suggests a somewhat high degree of interaction, perhaps around 0.3% or 0.5%.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the amount of recombination, which is a measure of genetic linkage between the two mutations. Recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of offspring that are recombinant. However, in this context, it's unclear whether we're talking about the proportion of bacteria that carry both mutations or the fraction of plumes that are due to recombination.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is likely B (2%) because it reflects a moderate level of recombination, which aligns with the observation that the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain B, suggesting some interaction between the two mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In the first case, only lysogenic phages infect strain B, causing its death. In the second case, both phages are present. Since strain B is mainly affected, perhaps the lysogenic phages don't kill all the bacteria, but maybe some combination occurs. Alternatively, maybe one phage type is dominant in certain conditions, leading to different outcomes. \n\nThe key here is the number of plumes. Plumes occur when phages cause lysogeny, leading to lysogenic phage infection. Each plume corresponds to an infection. If both mutation types are present, and their effects interact, the total number of plumes would depend on how they interfere. For example, if a lysogenic phage interferes with another mutation, it might reduce the effectiveness of both. Conversely, if they work together, maybe the combined effect increases the number of plumes.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 plumes. Strain K seems to be more susceptible, meaning that in the presence of lysogenic phages, strain K doesn't get as much infection. This could indicate that the lysogenic phages are effective against strain B but not against strain K. Alternatively, it could mean that strain K has a mutation that prevents the lysogenic phages from causing issues. \n\nWait, no. Actually, in the first case, only lysogenic phages are present, and they cause strain B to die. In the second case, both mutation types are present. So the lysogenic phages should still be able to cause strain B to die, but perhaps in combination with the other mutation? Or maybe the other mutation (the non-lytic phage) affects the lysogenic ones differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to more efficient lysogenic phage activity, but I'm not sure. Another angle is to consider the probability of each mutation occurring independently. If there's complete independence, the expected number of plumes would be additive. However, in reality, there's usually some interference between mutations. For instance, if a lysogenic phage integrates into the prophage DNA, it might disrupt the lysogenic machinery or interfere with the replication process, reducing the efficacy. Similarly, a non-lytic phage might affect the lysogenic phage by interfering with their replication.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, we're seeing that on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death, while on strain K, only the non-lytic phages do. That suggests that the non-lytic phages are effective against strain B but not against strain K. Or perhaps the opposite\u2014strain K is resistant to the lysogenic phage but susceptible to the non-lytic one. No, actually, the phages themselves are different. The lysogenic phages cause the lysogenic cycle, while the non-lytic ones cause the lytic cycle. So if the lysogenic phages are present, they cause the lysogenic infection, killing the bacteria. If the non-lytic phages are present, they cause the lytic infection, which might lead to lysogeny disruption or resistance.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage kills E. coli strain B, while the non-lytic phage doesn't. So in the first case, only the lysogenic phages are present. In the second case, both are present. Now, when both are present, the E. coli strain B is partially killed, but only 40% of the time. That suggests that the presence of both phages reduces the overall effectiveness of the lysogenic phages. Perhaps the non-lytic phages are interfering with the lysogenic phages by disrupting their replication or integrating into their prophage DNA, thereby reducing their efficiency in causing lysogeny.\n\nIn terms of recombination, if the two mutations are independent, the probability that a bacterium carries both mutations would be the product of their individual probabilities. But here, the presence of both mutations reduces the likelihood of lysogeny, indicating some form of interaction rather than independent events. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages, which allows them to integrate their prophages into each other's DNA. This can disrupt the lysogenic machinery or replication processes, making the phage less effective.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked through recombination, it would increase the chance of their simultaneous occurrence, potentially affecting the efficacy of lysogeny. But in this case, the problem is about calculating the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. To calculate that, we might need to look at the probabilities of each mutation occurring and then determine the likelihood of their co-occurrence.\n\nAssuming that each mutation has a certain frequency in the population, say p for the lysogenic phage and q for the non-lytic phage. The frequency of recombinant individuals would be approximately pq. But since the problem provides specific numbers of plumes, maybe we can infer the relative frequencies of the mutations.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact frequencies of each mutation, it's tricky. Maybe we can use the ratio of plumes to estimate the relative frequencies. Since on strain B, there are 40 plumes and on strain K, there are 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the presence of lysogenic phages is ten times more likely on strain B than on strain K. This implies that the lysogenic phage's presence is more prevalent on strain B, which might suggest that the lysogenic phage confers some advantage or susceptibility to strain B.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination would make the two mutations appear together more often. If recombination occurred, the chance of both mutations being present in a bacterium would be higher. Without recombination, the mutations would be independent, so the probability would be p*q.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the amount of recombination. It's possible that the presence of both mutations is due to some form of integration or interference, which would increase the likelihood of both mutations being present together, thus increasing the efficacy of lysogeny. Recombination typically enhances the efficiency of integration, so if there's recombination, the two mutations would be more likely to coexist, leading to better lysogeny.\n\nGiven that, if the two mutations are linked through recombination, the recombination rate would be significant. To quantify this, we might assume that the presence of both mutations is due to recombination, and calculate the percentage of the population where both mutations coexist. But without actual data on allele frequencies, it's challenging. However, the observed reduction in lysogeny suggests that the two mutations are interacting, possibly due to recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plumes if the mutations were independent. If the probability of a bacterium carrying both mutations is p*q, and assuming the total number of bacteria is N, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to p*q*N. However, without knowing N, it's hard to compute exact values.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes (40 vs. 4), it's about a 10:1 ratio, suggesting that the presence of lysogenic phages is ten times more common on strain B. This could imply that the lysogenic phage is advantageous in some way, such as providing a selective advantage, allowing it to dominate over the non-lytic phage, which might be less fit or resistant.\n\nBut going back to recombination. Recombination typically occurs at low rates unless strong selection pressures are applied. However, in this case, the presence of both mutations is observed, implying that some degree of recombination exists. Given that the two mutations are present in different proportions across the population, the recombination rate must account for the difference in their frequencies.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage (p) is higher on strain B, and the non-lytic phage (q) is also higher on strain B but not on strain K. If recombination is occurring, the combined frequency (p + q - r), where r is the recombination frequency, would give us the actual frequency of both mutations together.\n\nHowever, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the plume counts again. On strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4 plumes. Since the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain B, perhaps the recombination is happening such that the presence of both mutations is more frequent on strain B. Recombination would create a new phage type that combines the features of both, potentially enhancing their ability to infect. If recombination is high, the two mutations are more likely to coexist, leading to higher plume counts on strain B.\n\nTo find the percentage of recombination, perhaps we can compare the observed plume distribution to what would be expected under independent mutation. If recombination were absent, the expected number of plumes would be lower because the two mutations would act independently. With recombination, the number would be higher because they are integrated.\n\nGiven that, the presence of both mutations leads to more plumes on strain B, which suggests that recombination is occurring. The amount of recombination needed to explain the observed plume distribution can be estimated. But without knowing the exact mutation frequencies, it's challenging.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to recognize that the presence of both mutations is due to some form of interference. If the two mutations are linked through recombination, they might interfere with each other's effects. For example, a lysogenic phage may interfere with the replication of the non-lytic phage, reducing their effectiveness. This would decrease the number of plumes caused by the non-lytic phage, hence fewer plumes on strain B. Similarly, the lysogenic phage might interfere with the replication of the lysogenic phage itself, but I'm not sure how that would affect the plume count directly.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of both mutations might be due to some chromosomal integration process, like transduction or conjugation, where the prophages integrate into each other's DNA. This would allow the integration of one phage's genes into another, potentially disrupting their function. This could enhance the lysogenic activity of the phage, making it more effective at causing lysogeny, thus leading to more plumes on strain B.\n\nIn summary, given that the lysogenic phage is more effective on strain B, and the presence of both mutations leads to reduced plume count on strain B, it suggests that recombination is occurring between the two mutations. The amount of recombination needed to explain the observed plume distribution would correspond to a moderate level. Looking at the options, D is 0.05%, which is quite low, F is 0.3%, which is moderate, and G is 0.5%.

Recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of offspring that are recombinant.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the numbers again. When both mutants are present, the majority of E. coli from the first half (diluted 1:1e7) shows 4 plumes on strain B's lawn. On the second half, dilated 1:1e5, it's 40 plumes on strain K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because higher dilution would mean fewer plumes, right? Because if you dilute more, each well has fewer cells, so fewer phages will infect. So if you have a high dilution factor, fewer plumes. So the first scenario has 4 plumes on B, meaning low dilution (because less chance of infection), and the second has 40 plumes on K, which is even lower dilution\u2014wait, that can't be right. Maybe I got the dilution factors reversed. Let me clarify: dilution factor refers to how much you've reduced the original concentration. So a 1:1e7 dilution means you're using 1/10 million of the original concentration. Plating that would give fewer cells, so fewer phages infecting. So if you plate 1:1e7, fewer cells, so fewer plumes. But here, the first group (diluted 1:1e7) has 4 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:1e5) has 40 plumes. That seems contradictory because 1:1e5 is more dilution than 1:1e7, so you'd expect fewer plumes, not more. So perhaps I misunderstood the dilution factors. Alternatively, maybe the dilution factor affects the number of cells, but the way they're plated might differ. Or perhaps the actual numbers represent the count of plumes observed. Anyway, moving forward, I think the key point is that when both mutants are present, the total number of plumes depends on their interaction. The presence of both mutations likely leads to recombination, where the lysogenic phage's effect masks the lysogenic mutation, but wait, no\u2014it should still cause lysogenic fission. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination is such that the lysogenic phage in strain B could somehow interfere with the lysogenic mutation in strain K, but I don't think that's how it works. \n\nWait, another approach: The probability of a mutation leading to recombination can be estimated using the formula p = \u221a(N1 * N2 / N_total), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a certain pattern in the plasmid load. When both mutants are present, the cross between them may produce recombinant plasmids. Since the initial selection was for the lysogenic mutation in strain B, the presence of recombination might reduce the occurrence of the lysogenic mutation in the other strain, hence explaining why only strain B is affected. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall similar experiments. In the classic double mutant assay, when you have two different mutations, the presence of both can either increase or decrease the expression of the resulting recombinant plasmid. In this case, the presence of both mutants reduces the expression of the lysogenic mutation in strain B and increases it in strain K. This suggests that the two mutations interact via recombination, producing a recombinant plasmid that confers resistance to one strain but lethality to another. But how does this relate to the number of plumes?\n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple mutations can lead to increased susceptibility. If only strain B is affected, it implies that the recombination product confers resistance to strain B but lethality to strain K. Therefore, the level of recombination must be sufficient to allow this. To estimate the level of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\np = \u221a((n1 * n2)/(n1 + n2)^2))\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants can be calculated as 2 * p * q, where p is the frequency of one mutation and q the other. But since we have two mutations, we might need to consider the interference. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants and compare it to the observed data. If the observed number matches the expected, then there's no recombination; otherwise, there is.\n\nLet me try applying this. Suppose the two mutations are independent. The expected number of recombinants would depend on the crossover rate (recombination frequency) and the allele frequencies. But without knowing the allele frequencies, it's tricky. However, if we assume that the two mutations are present in equal amounts (i.e., their alleles are equally frequent), then the expected number of recombinants would be proportional to the crossover frequency. Given that only strain B is affected, it suggests that the recombination product confers resistance to strain B but lethality to strain K, implying that the recombination product is lethal to strain K but confers resistance to B.\n\nNow, looking back at the experiment: When both mutants are present, only strain B is affected, meaning that the recombination product is lethal to strain K but confers resistance to B. Therefore, the level of recombination must be high enough to allow this but not so high that strain K becomes susceptible. If the recombination frequency is too high, strain K would become resistant, but that contradicts the observation. Hence, the recombination frequency must be moderate.\n\nTo determine the exact level, we can use the formula for the probability of observing the number of recombinants. If R is the number of recombinant plasmids, and assuming independence, the expected number of recombinants E(R) = 2 * p * q * N, where N is the total number of plasmids. However, I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAnother method is to calculate the ratio of the plumes. The first group (dilution 1:1e7) had 4 plumes, and the second (dilution 1:1e5) had 40. Since dilution 1:1e7 is less than 1:1e5, the expectation is that the first should have fewer plumes. Here, 4 vs. 40, which fits because 1:1e7 is a lower dilution factor, so fewer cells are plated, thus fewer plumes. Now, to find the recombination frequency, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote f as the recombination frequency. The number of recombinants expected would be f multiplied by the total number of plasmids. Assuming that each strain has a certain number of plasmids, say P, then the expected recombinants would be f * P. However, without knowing P, it's challenging to directly compute f.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the plumes can help us infer the relative contributions of each mutation. If both mutations occurred independently, the probabilities would multiply. But since the presence of both mutants leads to a specific outcome, perhaps we can model the probability of each mutation and their interaction.\n\nGiven that the first group (low dilution) has 4 plumes and the second (higher dilution) has 40, the ratio is approximately 10 times higher. This suggests that the presence of both mutations allows for a higher incidence of the recombination product. Since the recombination product confers resistance to B but lethality to K, the recombination frequency must be just below the threshold that causes lethality in K. Therefore, the recombination frequency is close to 1% (since 99% would be lethal, but perhaps slightly less).\n\nLooking at the options, 1% corresponds to option A. However, sometimes in these calculations, the approximation used assumes that the recombination frequency is around 1%. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes in the second group is 10 times higher, which aligns with a recombination frequency of about 1%, as the expected number of recombinants would be proportional to that frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The fact that only strain B has significant issues suggests that when the lysogenic phage is present, it causes lytic fission and kills the E. coli, while the lysogenic phage (if any) might cause lysogenic fission without causing death. However, the presence of both types in the same sample might lead to recombination where the lysogenic phage's effect masks the lysogenic mutation, but wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage should still cause lysogenic fission regardless. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the numbers again. When both mutants are present, the majority of E. coli from the first half (diluted 1:1e7) shows 4 plumes on strain B's lawn. On the second half, dilated 1:1e5, it's 40 plumes on strain K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because higher dilution would mean fewer plumes, right? Because if you dilute more, each well has fewer cells, so fewer phages will infect. So if you have a high dilution factor, fewer plumes. So the first scenario has 4 plumes on B, meaning low dilution (because less chance of infection), and the second has 40 plumes on K, which is even lower dilution\u2014wait, that can't be right. Maybe I got the dilution factors reversed. Let me clarify: dilution factor refers to how much you've reduced the original concentration. So a 1:1e7 dilution means you're using 1/10 million of the original concentration. Plating that would give fewer cells, so fewer phages infecting. So if you plate 1:1e7, fewer cells, so fewer plumes. But here, the first group (diluted 1:1e7) has 4 plumes, and the second (diluted 1:1e5) has 40 plumes. That seems contradictory because 1:1e5 is more dilution than 1:1e7, so you'd expect fewer plumes, not more. So perhaps I misunderstood the dilution factors. Alternatively, maybe the dilution factor affects the number of cells, but the way they're plated might differ. Or perhaps the actual numbers represent the count of plumes observed. Anyway, moving forward, I think the key point is that when both mutants are present, the total number of plumes depends on their interaction. The presence of both mutations likely leads to recombination, where the lysogenic phage's effect masks the lysogenic mutation, but wait, no\u2014it should still cause lysogenic fission. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination is such that the lysogenic phage in strain B could somehow interfere with the lysogenic mutation in strain K, but I don't think that's how it works. \n\nWait, another approach: The probability of a mutation leading to recombination can be estimated using the formula p = \u221a(N1 * N2 / N_total), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a certain pattern in the plasmid load. When both mutants are present, the cross between them may produce recombinant plasmids. Since the initial selection was for the lysogenic mutation in strain B, the presence of recombination might reduce the occurrence of the lysogenic mutation in the other strain, hence explaining why only strain B is affected. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall similar experiments.

    "rollout": " The initial result shows that strain B has been affected, meaning some combination happened where lysogenic phages caused issues despite being present alongside wild-type ones? Or perhaps the presence of multiple phages leads to a higher rate of infection due to recombination. \n\nWait, the problem states that the T_4 phages with mutations in rII cause lytic fission in strain B but not in strain K. So when only the lysogenic phage is present (no mutation), strain B dies. With the mutation (lytic), it doesn't die. But with both types present, strain B is mostly affected, which probably indicates that the lysogenic phage from strain B (with mutation) plus any wild-type phages (without mutation) interact, causing some effect. Alternatively, maybe the mutation allows the phage to integrate better into the host genome, leading to a different outcome.\n\nThe experiment involves mixing the two mutantphages equally. Then, one half is plated on strain B's lawn at a high dilution factor (1e7), meaning few cells are plated, so the probability of getting a certain number of plumes is low. The other half is plated on strain K's lawn at a lower dilution factor (1e5), so more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more plumes. However, the result was 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That seems counterintuitive because if the phages are combining, we might expect less clumping. Wait, no, because when you mix two sets of phages, the total load increases, so the chance of random clumping decreases. But here, the number of plumes on K is much lower than expected. Maybe the combination isn't as effective as individual mutations would suggest, indicating reduced recombination or increased suppression.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage may either lyse or not, depending on their arrangement. Perhaps the combination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage, suggesting that the two mutations interfere with each other. This could be related to recombination, where the two mutations prevent each other from working effectively, reducing the overall efficacy.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (q + r - pq)/1\n\nBut wait, that might be for independent assortment. Alternatively, considering the expected number of plumes under different conditions. At high dilution (1e7), you'd get fewer plumes, while at low dilution (1e5), you'd see more. But the observed numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Since 1e7 gives 40 plumes and 1e5 gives 4, the ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor. That implies that the presence of the second mutation reduces the likelihood of infection, possibly due to interference in the phage's replication or integration process, which relates to recombination.\n\nIn genetic terms, if two mutations interfere (recombine), the combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects. The number of plumes would decrease because the phages don't work together as effectively. Using the formula for interference in genetic crosses:\n\np = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total)\n\nBut in this case, it's about phage interactions. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are present might be less than expected. Let's model this.\n\nLet\u2019s say p is the fraction of cells that are lysogenic. If both mutations are present, the actual efficiency of the lysogenic phage depends on whether they recombine. If recombination occurs, the efficiency is lower; otherwise, it's normal. Suppose the original lysogenic phage has an efficiency q. If recombination occurs, it becomes q', which is less than q.\n\nWhen both mutants are present, the average efficiency is somewhere between q and q'. But without knowing the exact values, we can estimate the degree of recombination using the observed number of plumes.\n\nAssuming that at high dilution (1e7), the number of plumes should correspond to the expected number if no recombination occurred. Similarly, at low dilution, the expectation changes. The observed numbers indicate that at high dilution, the plumes are higher, which suggests that the presence of the second mutation is interfering with the first. Conversely, at low dilution, the plumes are lower, implying that the second mutation is enhancing the first, which contradicts the given information unless recombination is occurring.\n\nWait, the given data says that when only the lysogenic mutation is present (no recombination?), strain B dies. With both mutations, strain B is mostly affected. So perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a loss of activity. Therefore, the two mutations must interfere with each other, reducing the overall activity.\n\nUsing the formula for interference:\n\nIf two mutations interfere, the coefficient of coincidence c is negative. The number of double recombinants is less than expected for independent assortment.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nc = (observed / expected) * (1/expected)\n\nWait, no, more accurately, for interference, the expected number of double recombinants is n(n-1)c, where n is the number of possible recombinants. For two loci, the expected number of recombinants is 2n, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to calculate the percentage reduction in plumes. From 40 to 4, that's a 95% reduction. If the original expectation at high dilution is around 40, then the number of plumes at low dilution is 1/10th of that, indicating that the presence of the second mutation significantly reduces the number of plumes. This suggests that the two mutations interfere, and the recombination frequency is relatively high.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A.1%, B.2%, C.1.5%, D.0.1%, E.0.2%, F.0.3%, G.0.5%, H.5%, I.0.02%, J.0.05%, K.0.01%.\n\nGiven the significant reduction in plumes from 40 to 4 (which is 1/10), this suggests that the two mutations are very close to recombining. However, option G is 0.5%, which is lower than that. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor leading to 10 times fewer plumes, that implies that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Thus, the recombination frequency is approximately log(10) \u2248 0.3%, which corresponds to option F.\n\nWait, but sometimes the relationship between recombination and the number of plumes is modeled as a Poisson distribution, where the number of events is proportional to the product of the concentrations. In this case, the concentration of phages is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So the number of plumes would be proportional to (concentration of phage 1) * (concentration of phage 2) multiplied by some constant. If recombination occurs, the effective concentration increases slightly, which would lead to more plumes. However, in our case, the number of plumes decreased, suggesting that recombination actually reduces the effective concentration.\n\nTherefore, the presence of recombination reduces the effective number of phages available to infect, thus decreasing the number of plumes. The amount of recombination needed to reduce the number of plumes by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4) can be estimated. Assuming that the number of plumes N is proportional to the product of the concentrations c1 and c2, and that recombination affects c1*c2, the change in N would depend on the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x, then the effective concentration would increase by (1 - x). Therefore, the new concentration would be c1 * c2 * (1 - x). The number of plumes would then be proportional to c1 * c2 * (1 - x). To reduce N by a factor of 10, (1 - x) should be 1/10, so x \u2248 0.9. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is logarithmic, and a factor of 10 reduction in N requires a recombination frequency of log10(1/10) = 1, which again is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plumes at different dilutions. At high dilution (1e7), the number of plumes is 40, and at low dilution (1e5), it's 4. The ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor, which implies that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Therefore, the product of the concentrations is proportional to the dilution factor. Since the product is proportional to the dilution factor, and recombination affects the product, the recombination frequency can be calculated as ln(10) \u2248 0.693. But the closest option is H.5%, which is lower than that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but that's speculative. Another way is to assume that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations. Since the concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilution factors, the product is inversely proportional to the dilution factor squared. Therefore, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor equal to the dilution factor squared. Given that the number of plumes went from 40 to 4, which is a factor of 10, so sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, which would imply that the dilution factor squared is 10. Therefore, the dilution factor is sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, which matches the observed reduction.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is approximately log10(sqrt(10)) = 0.5, which is option F (0.3%)? Wait, no, 0.5 is not an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nIf the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor squared, then:\n\nN_high_dilution = k / (dilution_high)^2\n\nN_low_dilution = k / (dilution_low)^2\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nN_high / N_low = (dilution_low)^2 / (dilution_high)^2\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = (1e5)^2 / (1e7)^2\n\n10 = (1e-2) \u2192 10 = 0.01 \u2192 No, that's incorrect. Wait, 1e5 squared is 1e10, and 1e7 squared is 1e14. So 40 / 4 = (1e10) / (1e14) \u2192 10 = 1e-4 \u2192 10 = 0.0001, which is false. So my assumption is wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of plumes is proportional to the dilution factor. Then:\n\n40 = k * 1e7\n\n4 = k * 1e5\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n40 / 4 = (k * 1e7) / (k * 1e5) \u2192 10 = 100 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nNo, that doesn't work. Alternatively, the number of plumes is proportional to the reciprocal of the dilution factor:\n\n40 = k / 1e7\n\n4 = k / 1e5\n\nDividing:\n\n40 / 4 = (k / 1e7) / (k / 1e5) \u2192 10 = (1e5) / (1e7) \u2192 10 = 0.01 \u2192 False.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe a better approach is to recognize that the number of plumes decreases by a factor of 10 when the dilution factor increases by a factor of 100 (from 1e7 to 1e5). So, if the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, then N \u221d 1/d. So, when d doubles, N halves. But in our case, d increases tenfold, N decreases tenfold, which fits N \u221d 1/d. Therefore, the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nNow, considering that the presence of two mutations reduces the efficiency of the phage, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the concentrations of each mutation. Since concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilution factors, the product is inversely proportional to d\u00b2. Therefore, the number of plumes is proportional to 1/d\u00b2.\n\nWe observe that N_high = 40, N_low = 4. Since d_high = 1e7, d_low = 1e5. d_high/d_low = 100. Therefore, N_high/N_low = 10 = (1/d_high\u00b2)/(1/d_low\u00b2) )= (d_low/d_high)\u00b2 \u2192 10 = (1/100)\u00b2 \u2192 10 = 0.0001 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, if N \u221d 1/d, then N_high/N_low = 100 = (d_low/d_high) \u2192 100 = 1/10 \u2192 Contradiction again.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is N \u221d (d_high * d_low)^(1/2). Then, N_high/N_low = sqrt(d_high/d_low) \u2192 40/4 = sqrt(1e7 / 1e5) \u2192 10 = sqrt(100) \u2192 10=10 \u2192 Correct. So, the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor.\n\nBut why? Because the number of plumes is influenced by both concentrations. If concentration1 * concentration2 is proportional to sqrt(dilution factor), then N \u221d sqrt(dilution factor).\n\nThen, N_high/N_low = sqrt(d_high/d_low) \u2192 10 = sqrt(100) \u2192 10=10 \u2192 Correct.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency can be determined by the relationship between the number of plumes and the dilution factors. Since N is proportional to sqrt(d), the change in N reflects a change in d. However, I'm still not sure how to directly relate this to the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother angle: If the two mutations interfere, the effective number of phages available decreases. The number of plumes would be inversely proportional to the square of the dilution factor because both concentrations are involved. But without precise calculations, it's hard to determine exactly. However, given the options, the most reasonable answer based on the significant decrease in plumes (from 40 to 4) is likely option F (0.3%), as it reflects a substantial reduction in plasmid availability.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The initial result shows that strain B has been affected, meaning some combination happened where lysogenic phages caused issues despite being present alongside wild-type ones? Or perhaps the presence of multiple phages leads to a higher rate of infection due to recombination. \n\nWait, the problem states that the T_4 phages with mutations in rII cause lytic fission in strain B but not in strain K. So when only the lysogenic phage is present (no mutation), strain B dies. With the mutation (lytic), it doesn't die. But with both types present, strain B is mostly affected, which probably indicates that the lysogenic phage from strain B (with mutation) plus any wild-type phages (without mutation) interact, causing some effect. Alternatively, maybe the mutation allows the phage to integrate better into the host genome, leading to a different outcome.\n\nThe experiment involves mixing the two mutantphages equally. Then, one half is plated on strain B's lawn at a high dilution factor (1e7), meaning few cells are plated, so the probability of getting a certain number of plumes is low. The other half is plated on strain K's lawn at a lower dilution factor (1e5), so more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more plumes. However, the result was 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That seems counterintuitive because if the phages are combining, we might expect less clumping. Wait, no, because when you mix two sets of phages, the total load increases, so the chance of random clumping decreases. But here, the number of plumes on K is much lower than expected. Maybe the combination isn't as effective as individual mutations would suggest, indicating reduced recombination or increased suppression.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage may either lyse or not, depending on their arrangement. Perhaps the combination reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage, suggesting that the two mutations interfere with each other. This could be related to recombination, where the two mutations prevent each other from working effectively, reducing the overall efficacy.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (q + r - pq)/1\n\nBut wait, that might be for independent assortment. Alternatively, considering the expected number of plumes under different conditions. At high dilution (1e7), you'd get fewer plumes, while at low dilution (1e5), you'd see more. But the observed numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. The ratio is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Since 1e7 gives 40 plumes and 1e5 gives 4, the ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor. That implies that the presence of the second mutation reduces the likelihood of infection, possibly due to interference in the phage's replication or integration process, which relates to recombination.\n\nIn genetic terms, if two mutations interfere (recombine), the combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects. The number of plumes would decrease because the phages don't work together as effectively. Using the formula for interference in genetic crosses:\n\np = (number of recombinant offspring)/(total)\n\nBut in this case, it's about phage interactions. The expected number of plumes when both mutations are present might be less than expected. Let's model this.\n\nLet\u2019s say p is the fraction of cells that are lysogenic. If both mutations are present, the actual efficiency of the lysogenic phage depends on whether they recombine. If recombination occurs, the efficiency is lower; otherwise, it's normal. Suppose the original lysogenic phage has an efficiency q. If recombination occurs, it becomes q', which is less than q.\n\nWhen both mutants are present, the average efficiency is somewhere between q and q'. But without knowing the exact values, we can estimate the degree of recombination using the observed number of plumes.\n\nAssuming that at high dilution (1e7), the number of plumes should correspond to the expected number if no recombination occurred. Similarly, at low dilution, the expectation changes. The observed numbers indicate that at high dilution, the plumes are higher, which suggests that the presence of the second mutation is interfering with the first. Conversely, at low dilution, the plumes are lower, implying that the second mutation is enhancing the first, which contradicts the given information unless recombination is occurring.\n\nWait, the given data says that when only the lysogenic mutation is present (no recombination?), strain B dies. With both mutations, strain B is mostly affected. So perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a loss of activity. Therefore, the two mutations must interfere with each other, reducing the overall activity.\n\nUsing the formula for interference:\n\nIf two mutations interfere, the coefficient of coincidence c is negative. The number of double recombinants is less than expected for independent assortment.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nc = (observed / expected) * (1/expected)\n\nWait, no, more accurately, for interference, the expected number of double recombinants is n(n-1)c, where n is the number of possible recombinants. For two loci, the expected number of recombinants is 2n, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to calculate the percentage reduction in plumes. From 40 to 4, that's a 95% reduction. If the original expectation at high dilution is around 40, then the number of plumes at low dilution is 1/10th of that, indicating that the presence of the second mutation significantly reduces the number of plumes. This suggests that the two mutations interfere, and the recombination frequency is relatively high.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A.1%, B.2%, C.1.5%, D.0.1%, E.0.2%, F.0.3%, G.0.5%, H.5%, I.0.02%, J.0.05%, K.0.01%.\n\nGiven the significant reduction in plumes from 40 to 4 (which is 1/10), this suggests that the two mutations are very close to recombining. However, option G is 0.5%, which is lower than that. Option F is 0.3%, which is closer. Alternatively, if the ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor leading to 10 times fewer plumes, that implies that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Thus, the recombination frequency is approximately log(10) \u2248 0.3%, which corresponds to option F.\n\nWait, but sometimes the relationship between recombination and the number of plumes is modeled as a Poisson distribution, where the number of events is proportional to the product of the concentrations. In this case, the concentration of phages is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So the number of plumes would be proportional to (concentration of phage 1) * (concentration of phage 2) multiplied by some constant. If recombination occurs, the effective concentration increases slightly, which would lead to more plumes. However, in our case, the number of plumes decreased, suggesting that recombination actually reduces the effective concentration.\n\nTherefore, the presence of recombination reduces the effective number of phages available to infect, thus decreasing the number of plumes. The amount of recombination needed to reduce the number of plumes by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4) can be estimated. Assuming that the number of plumes N is proportional to the product of the concentrations c1 and c2, and that recombination affects c1*c2, the change in N would depend on the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x, then the effective concentration would increase by (1 - x). Therefore, the new concentration would be c1 * c2 * (1 - x). The number of plumes would then be proportional to c1 * c2 * (1 - x). To reduce N by a factor of 10, (1 - x) should be 1/10, so x \u2248 0.9. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is logarithmic, and a factor of 10 reduction in N requires a recombination frequency of log10(1/10) = 1, which again is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the number of plumes at different dilutions. At high dilution (1e7), the number of plumes is 40, and at low dilution (1e5), it's 4. The ratio is 10 times higher dilution factor, which implies that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Therefore, the product of the concentrations is proportional to the dilution factor. Since the product is proportional to the dilution factor, and recombination affects the product, the recombination frequency can be calculated as ln(10) \u2248 0.693. But the closest option is H.5%, which is lower than that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution factor, but that's speculative. Another way is to assume that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations. Since the concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilution factors, the product is inversely proportional to the dilution factor squared. Therefore, the number of plumes would decrease by a factor equal to the dilution factor squared. Given that the number of plumes went from 40 to 4, which is a factor of 10, so sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, which would imply that the dilution factor squared is 10. Therefore, the dilution factor is sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, which matches the observed reduction.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is approximately log10(sqrt(10)) = 0.5, which is option F (0.3%)? Wait, no, 0.5 is not an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nIf the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor squared, then:\n\nN_high_dilution = k / (dilution_high)^2\n\nN_low_dilution = k / (dilution_low)^2\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nN_high / N_low = (dilution_low)^2 / (dilution_high)^2\n\nSo,\n\n40 / 4 = (1e5)^2 / (1e7)^2\n\n10 = (1e-2) \u2192 10 = 0.01 \u2192 No, that's incorrect. Wait, 1e5 squared is 1e10, and 1e7 squared is 1e14. So 40 / 4 = (1e10) / (1e14) \u2192 10 = 1e-4 \u2192 10 = 0.0001, which is false. So my assumption is wrong.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of plumes is proportional to the dilution factor. Then:\n\n40 = k * 1e7\n\n4 = k * 1e5\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n40 / 4 = (k * 1e7) / (k * 1e5) \u2192 10 = 100 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nNo, that doesn't work. Alternatively, the number of plumes is proportional to the reciprocal of the dilution factor:\n\n40 = k / 1e7\n\n4 = k / 1e5\n\nDividing:\n\n40 / 4 = (k / 1e7) / (k / 1e5) \u2192 10 = (1e5) / (1e7) \u2192 10 = 0.01 \u2192 False.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe a better approach is to recognize that the number of plumes decreases by a factor of 10 when the dilution factor increases by a factor of 100 (from 1e7 to 1e5). So, if the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor, then N \u221d 1/d. So, when d doubles, N halves. But in our case, d increases tenfold, N decreases tenfold, which fits N \u221d 1/d. Therefore, the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nNow, considering that the presence of two mutations reduces the efficiency of the phage, the number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the concentrations of each mutation. Since concentrations are inversely proportional to the dilution factors, the product is inversely proportional to d\u00b2. Therefore, the number of plumes is proportional to 1/d\u00b2.\n\nWe observe that N_high = 40, N_low = 4. Since d_high = 1e7, d_low = 1e5. d_high/d_low = 100. Therefore, N_high/N_low = 10 = (1/d_high\u00b2)/(1/d_low\u00b2) )= (d_low/d_high)\u00b2 \u2192 10 = (1/100)\u00b2 \u2192 10 = 0.0001 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, if N \u221d 1/d, then N_high/N_low = 100 = (d_low/d_high) \u2192 100 = 1/10 \u2192 Contradiction again.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is N \u221d (d_high * d_low)^(1/2). Then, N_high/N_low = sqrt(d_high/d_low) \u2192 40/4 = sqrt(1e7 / 1e5) \u2192 10 = sqrt(100) \u2192 10=10 \u2192 Correct. So, the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the dilution factor.\n\nBut why? Because the number of plumes is influenced by both concentrations. If concentration1 * concentration2 is proportional to sqrt(dilution factor), then N \u221d sqrt(dilution factor).\n\nThen, N_high/N_low = sqrt(d_high/d_low) \u2192 10 = sqrt(100) \u2192 10=10 \u2192 Correct.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency can be determined by the relationship between the number of plumes and the dilution factors. Since N is proportional to sqrt(d), the change in N reflects a change in d. However, I'm still not sure how to directly relate this to the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother angle: If the two mutations interfere, the effective number of phages available decreases. The number of plumes would be inversely proportional to the square of the dilution factor because both concentrations are involved. But without precise calculations, it's hard to determine exactly. However, given the options, the most reasonable answer based on the significant decrease in plumes (from 40 to 4) is likely option F (0.3%), as it reflects a substantial reduction in plasmid availability.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

However, the presence of two different mutation types might lead to a phenomenon where their effects interfere. In phage genetics, when two mutations are present, especially in the same gene locus, they can either interfere constructively or destructively. Constructive interference would reduce the effective number of phages, leading to fewer infections, whereas destructive interference would increase it. \n\nIn this case, since the lysogenic phage (causing lysis) isn't affecting strain B, the lysogenic phage must be interacting with the lysogenic phage elsewhere. Wait, no\u2014strain B is being treated with both phage types. Hmm, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B (the non-lysis type) is causing the issue. The other phage is lysogenic too, but maybe it's not causing damage. Or wait, maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B is replicating and causing the lysogenism to spread, making the lysogenic phage from strain K also replicate. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing the lysogeny, which then leads to the lysogenic phage from strain K replicating, thus causing more infections. \n\nBut let's approach this statistically. The number of plumes depends on the dilution effect. For each half, the concentration of phages is determined by the dilution factor. On strain B's half, the phages are at a higher concentration (dilution factor 1e7), so fewer phages are present, meaning fewer infections. On strain K's half, the phages are at a lower concentration (dilution factor 1e5), so more phages, leading to more infections. The difference in plumes reflects this. \n\nIf there were complete independence, we'd expect similar numbers. But since one half has more phages than the other, it's expected to have more plumes on the half with lower dilution (higher concentration). Here, strain K's half has fewer plumes compared to strain B's half despite having a lower dilution factor? Wait, no\u2014the dilution factor is reciprocal; a higher dilution factor means fewer cells plated, hence fewer potential infections. So if you plate more cells (lower dilution factor), you're more likely to get more infections. So on strain B's half, which is plated at 1e7 (low concentration), you'd expect less plumes, but instead, you got more (40 vs. 4). On strain K's half, plated at 1e5 (high concentration), you saw fewer plumes (4 vs. 40). This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B is more effective because it's replicated enough to cause more infections. \n\nThis indicates that the two mutations may interfere with each other. Specifically, the lysogenic phage from strain B (which causes lysis) and the lysogenic phage from strain K (which doesn't affect strain B) could be interfering. If their replication is mutually exclusive, then the presence of one affects the replication of the other. \n\nTo quantify this, the expected number of plumes under complete independence would be the average of the two, but since they're in different media (strains B and K), the actual counts are different. The ratio of plumes on strain B's half to strain K's half is 40/4 = 10 times higher. Assuming each occurrence is independent, the probability of multiple events would multiply. \n\nLet\u2019s model this as a Poisson distribution, where \u03bb is the expected number of events. For strain B, \u03bb_B = 40 / (number of wells * dilution factor) = 40/(1*1e7) = 4e-6. For strain K, \u03bb_K = 4/(1*1e5) = 4e-5. The total rate is \u03bb_total = \u03bb_B + \u03bb_K = 4e-6 + 4e-5 = 4.4e-5. The probability of observing k events is P(k) = e^{-\u03bb_total} * \u03bb_total^k / k!. \n\nBut this might be overcomplicating things.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Now, when both are present, half the population is treated with 1:1e7 and the other half with 1:1e5. \n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both phages leads to some sort of interference where multiple phages can cause replication stress or something, leading to reduced efficiency. But more likely, it's about the interaction between the two phages causing some kind of recombination. Recombination would mean that their genetic material combines, potentially allowing them to work together better or worse. In phages, especially T4, when they integrate another gene, they can form a recombinant phage that may have different properties. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't doing anything bad unless combined with the other mutation type. But since only strain B is affected by the lysogenic phage, maybe the other mutation type is non-recombinant? Or perhaps it's the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, when both phages are present, the outcome depends on whether they interfere with each other. If the lysogenic phage (which is usually non-recombinant) is present along with a recombinant phage, sometimes it can lead to less efficient replication or even selection against certain strains. But here, the fact that only strain B is affected suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage alone doesn't affect strain B much, implying that the other mutation is non-recombining. Maybe the other mutation is a new mutation that doesn't interact with the existing ones as much.\n\nBut the main point is determining the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency refers to the proportion of offspring expressing a particular trait due to recombination. In phages, if two mutations are present, their combination can either increase or decrease the likelihood of certain outcomes. For example, if one mutation is beneficial and the other is deleterious, their combination could be beneficial or neutral depending on their location in the genome.\n\nIn this scenario, the lysogenic phage (non-recombinant) affects strain B, while the other mutation (recombinant?) affects another strain. The experiment shows that the presence of both phages leads to some segregation, with half being effective against B and half against K. This suggests that the recombination occurred in such a way that when both phages are present, the effect is partially observed. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's tricky.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the number of plasmids or the ratio of plating. If the concentrations are too high, the plasmids may replicate before the phage can infect. So a higher dilution factor (lower concentration) reduces the chance of replication, making the phage more likely to infect. So when half the culture is plated at 1:1e7 and the other at 1:1e5, the first group has lower replication pressure, meaning more phages will infect, leading to more plasmids and more expression. But in reality, both groups had similar numbers of plasmids. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both phages caused some kind of competition, affecting the replication or expression.\n\nWait, maybe the key lies in the fact that when only one mutation is present, strain B is mostly affected, but when both are present, the effects are split. This suggests that the second mutation (the one from strain K) is acting independently. If the recombination fraction was 50%, then half the time the two mutations would cause a problem. But given the results, it's possible that the recombination resulted in a situation where the probability of the lysogenic phage attacking the phage from strain K increased.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the possible number of recombinants. If the recombination frequency was low (say, 1%), then the chance that a randomly selected bacterium carries a recombinant phage is 1%. In the experiment, half the bacteria were treated with 1:1e7 (low concentration), so more would express the recombinant phage. The other half with 1:1e5 (higher concentration) would show less expression. The total number of plasmids expressed in each group was 40 vs 4. That seems like a significant difference, suggesting that the presence of both phages led to a selective advantage in favoring the strain that received the recombinant mutation. Wait, but the problem states that only strain B is affected by the lysogenic phage. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. The answer options suggest percentages, ranging from 0.05% up to 5%. Typically, recombination frequencies are measured using the number of recombinant offspring, often expressed as a percentage. But in phage experiments, the concept is slightly different. It's about the efficiency of the phage. If two mutations are present, the probability that a phage carrying both mutations will infect a bacterium is higher than those carrying only one mutation.\n\nWait, no, in phage genetics, the presence of two mutations increases the chance that a phage with both mutations will infect, thus causing more plasmid loss. But in this case, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, indicating that the other mutation isn't causing an issue. Therefore, the recombination must occur elsewhere. Perhaps the other mutation is a new, non-essential mutation that doesn't interfere with the lysogenic phage.\n\nGiven the experimental results, the presence of both mutations splits the plasmids into two groups. The strain B group had more plasmids than the strain K group. This suggests that the strain K's mutation was under-represented, possibly because it didn't contribute enough to the overall plasmid load. This might indicate that the recombination happened in such a way that the strain K's mutation was lost, reducing the overall plasmid burden. But without knowing the specific mutation details, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination could have increased the efficiency of the lysogenic phage in killing E. coli strain B, but that contradicts the initial observation. Wait, the initial observation said that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So perhaps the other mutation is non-recombinant, and the recombination occurs elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem mentions that when both mutations are present, half the bacteria are treated with a low dilution (1:1e7) and half with a higher dilution (1:1e5). The results are 4 plasmids on K and 40 on B. Without any recombination, we'd expect equal distribution, but here, K has more plasmids, suggesting that the strain K's mutation is less prevalent. This implies that the recombination caused the strain K's mutation to be underrepresented. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high\u2014more often, a bacterium with the strain K mutation would experience less plasmid loss upon treatment.\n\nTypically, recombination frequency is around 50% when there's a 50% chance of inheriting a mutation from either parent. But in phages, the concept is a bit different. The recombination frequency here would represent the proportion of the population where the two mutations combine. However, in this experiment, since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, the other mutation must not be causing the issue. Thus, the recombination must have occurred elsewhere, leading to a higher expression of the strain K's mutation in the presence of both phages.\n\nGiven the results, the number of plasmids on strain K is significantly less than on strain B. This suggests that the strain K's mutation is underrepresented, implying that the recombination occurred in such a way that the strain K's mutation wasn't passed on as frequently. Therefore, the recombination frequency must be relatively high. Looking at the options, 5% is quite high, but the options go down to 0.05%. Considering typical recombination rates in phages, which are generally low (like 1-5%), the correct answer would be around 1-2%, which corresponds to options B (2%) and F (0.3%). Between these, 0.3% is closer to 0.05%, but the standard range is usually considered up to 5%.\n\nHowever, given that the experiment showed a significant difference in plasmid counts, it's likely that the recombination is occurring in a way that increases the likelihood of the strain K's mutation being present. But without exact data, it's challenging. However, considering the options, 0.05% is the smallest, and 0.3% is the next. Given the results, it's plausible that the recombination is happening more frequently, so the answer is D (0.05%) or E (0.2%). Since the results are 4 vs 40, which is a ratio of 1:10, suggesting a lower chance of occurrence, perhaps 0.2% makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Since the dilutions were different (1e7 vs 1e5), this might indicate that the phages from strain B are more likely to cause infections on strain B's lawn because their dilution was less concentrated. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple mutations increases the number of phages available, leading to more infections. But wait, the fact that both types are present complicates things. Maybe the combination leads to more interactions where the phages cause double infections or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down. Each half is treated separately. The first half is 1:1e7, meaning each well has 1e-7 of the bacterial population. Plated on strain B's lawn. The second half is 1:1e5, so more cells are plated. Then each plate shows either 4 or 40 plumes. Wait, no\u2014actually, the question says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" And then the same for strain K. So each half is a separate experiment. For the first half, treating with 1:1e7 phages on strain B's lawn. The result is some number of plumes, say X. Then the other half, treating with 1:1e5 phages on strain K's lawn, resulting in Y plumes. Finally, they plate both strains with the same concentration on their own laths. The numbers given are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact interpretation. Let me try to visualize this. So, when both types of phages are present, the E. coli grows on strain B's lawn. But why would that happen? Because the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, so it should survive and cause lysogeny instead of lysing. Therefore, the phages from strain B shouldn't be able to grow on strain B's lawn unless there's some interaction. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, they do grow because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the K strain. But why did some E. coli grow on strain K's lawn and others on strain B's? That suggests that the phages interact in a way that allows some growth on one strain but not the other. This could happen through recombination. Recombination would involve the movement of genetic material between phages or between phages and E. coli. If recombination occurs between the two types of phages, then the phages from strain B could potentially infect strain K's bacteria. Or vice versa. But the specific effect observed is that on strain B's lawn, there were 40 plumes, and on strain K's, 4. That seems like a significant difference. Normally, without any interference, the number of plumes would depend on the dilution factor and the probability of a single phage attacking the bacteria. The formula for calculating the expected number of plumes is N = (Dilution Factor) * (Probability of Infection). Assuming the probability of a single phage causing an infection is p, then N \u2248 D * p. For example, D=1e5 gives N\u2248p*1e5, and D=1e7 gives N\u2248p*1e7. Now, considering that both types of phages were present, the combined effect would influence the number of plumes. However, the observed difference between 40 and 4 plumes is quite large. Let's compute the ratio of plumes: 40 / 4 = 10 times. This suggests that the presence of strain B's phages caused ten times as many infections on strain B's lawn compared to strain K's. Given that the dilution factors are different, this implies that the presence of strain B's phages affects the growth on strain B's lawn, while the presence of strain K's phages affects the growth on strain K's lawn. This indicates that the two mutation types interact, possibly through recombination. To determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nBut in this case, the numbers of plumes suggest a certain level of interaction. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability of recombination using the formula:\n\np = sqrt( (N_B - N_K) / (N_B + N_K) )\n\nWhere N_B is the number of plumes on strain B's lawn, and N_K is on strain K's. Plugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/(40+4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818. Taking the square root gives approximately 0.904, which is about 90%. But this doesn't match any of the options provided. Perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to consider the likelihood of recombination based on the number of plumes. If there's significant interaction, the number of plumes might correlate with the degree of recombination. Alternatively, the problem may relate to the concept of double mutants or the interaction between two types of phages causing different outcomes on each strain. Another angle is to recognize that when both mutation types are present, the total number of possible interactions determines the outcome. The larger number of plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the phages from strain B are more effective at infecting strain B's bacteria, perhaps due to some recombination. The smaller number on strain K's lawn suggests that the phages from strain K are more effective at infecting strain K's bacteria. If the two phage types can coexist, it might lead to some form of interaction where the effectiveness depends on the relative concentrations. Alternatively, the number of plumes could be influenced by the efficiency of each type of phage. For instance, if the lysogenic phage is more efficient at infecting certain strains, its presence would increase the plume count on those strains. But in this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B shouldn't affect strain B's lawn because it doesn't lyse the target. It should instead cause lysogeny, leading to growth on strain K's lawn. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from strain K shouldn't affect strain B's lawn. But the observed result is that both strains grew, which contradicts this expectation. Therefore, the presence of both phages must allow for some interaction. Perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B infects strain K's bacteria, creating a double mutant, while the lysogenic phage from strain K infects strain B's bacteria. The difference in plume counts reflects the relative effectiveness of these interactions. If the lysogenic phage from strain B infects strain K's bacteria, it would create a double mutant on strain K's lawn. Conversely, the lysogenic phage from strain K infects strain B's bacteria, creating a double mutant on strain B's lawn. The difference in plume counts would reflect the strength of these interactions. The larger number of plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the interaction is stronger on strain B's side, implying a higher degree of recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (sqrt(N_B + N_K) - sqrt(|N_B - N_K|)) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(K))\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach is to realize that the number of plumes corresponds to the product of the probabilities of each phage causing an infection. If the two phages interact, the overall probability becomes p1 + p2 - p1*p2. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, the number of plumes can be modeled as N = (Dilution Factor) * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2). However, without knowing p1 and p2 individually, it's tricky. But given the observed differences, we can infer the degree of recombination. The fact that the lysogenic phage from strain B causes more plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the interaction is strong enough to produce a higher number of double mutants on strain B's lawn. The difference in plume counts is 36, which is almost all of the plumes on strain B's lawn. On strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes are found, suggesting minimal interaction or no interaction at all. This discrepancy suggests that most of the phages from strain B are interacting with strain K's phages, leading to some double mutants on strain B's lawn but none on strain K's. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high. Looking back at the answer choices, the highest option is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). However, 90% seems too high for such a small region. Rechecking my calculations, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try again. The formula for recombination frequency is RF = sqrt( (N_B - N_K) / (N_B + N_K) ). Plugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/(40+4)=36/44\u22480.818. Square root is ~0.904, which is about 90%, not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses (N_B + N_K)/(N_B - N_K). Let's see: (40+4)/(40-4)=44/36\u22481.222. Square root is ~1.105, which is over 100%, impossible. Alternatively, maybe the formula is RF = (N_B - N_K)/(N_B + N_K). Which brings us back to 0.818, which is 90%. Still not matching the options. Perhaps I misunderstood the experiment. The experiment involved two halves: one half with 1:1e7 phages on strain B's lawn, resulting in X plumes; the other half with 1:1e5 phages on strain K's lawn, resulting in Y plumes. Then they plated both strains with the same concentration on their respective laths, resulting in 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, this might imply that the original plating had some background noise, and now they're adding the same plating to both strains' laths. So perhaps the initial plating (on B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and the initial plating (on K's lawn) had 4 plumes. Then they added the same plating to both strains' laths, resulting in 40 on B and 4 on K. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the initial plating on B's lawn had 40 plumes, and on K's lawn had 4. Then they add the same plating quantity to both strains' laths, which would dilute the existing plumes further. But the question states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So perhaps the initial plating (on B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and when added to strain K's lawn, which had 4 plumes, the total became 40 and 4. But that still doesn't explain the recombination aspect. Alternatively, perhaps the original plating (on B's lawn) resulted in 40 plumes, and on K's lawn, the original plating resulted in 4. Then, when both strains are plated with the same concentration, the total plumes become 40 and 4. But this doesn't directly relate to recombination. Alternatively, the experiment may have been designed to observe the effect of combining the two mutation types on each strain's lawn, but the results showed varying plume counts indicating interaction. The key insight is that the presence of both mutation types significantly affects the growth on each strain's lawn, suggesting that the phages interact, leading to some double mutants. The recombination frequency would then be determined by comparing the plume frequencies. Since the difference is large (36 plumes), it suggests a high degree of interaction. Looking at the options, the highest recombination frequency is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). 90% is way beyond these. Perhaps the calculation needs to consider the dilution factors differently. Let's try recalculating using a different approach. The number of plumes on each strain's lawn is proportional to the dilution factor times the probability of infection. Suppose p is the probability of a single phage causing an infection. Then on strain B's lawn, N_B = D_B * p, and on strain K's lawn, N_K = D_K * p. But this assumes independent events, which may not hold if there's interaction. However, if the two phages interact, the actual probability might be different. Alternatively, the observed number of plumes could be explained by the interaction reducing the effective probability. Let\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as R. Then, the effective probability of infection could be p = p1 + p2 - p1*p2. Then, N_B = D_B * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) and N_K = D_K * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2). But without knowing p1 and p2, it's hard to solve. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes could give the ratio of probabilities. N_B/N_K = (D_B/D_K) * [ (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) ] \u2192 same ratio. Not helpful. Alternatively, focusing on the change from D_B=1e7 to D_K=1e5. The plume count goes up by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), which suggests that the increased dilution factor compensates for the reduced probability of infection. If the probability of infection decreases sufficiently with the increased dilution, the net effect on plume count can remain similar. Let\u2019s suppose that without interaction, the plume count on strain B's lawn would be D_B * p, and on strain K's lawn, D_K * p. With interaction, the plume count on B's lawn becomes D_B * (p + q - pq), and on K's lawn, D_K * (p + q - pq), where q is the contribution from the interaction. However, without knowing q, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction reduces the probability by a certain factor. Let\u2019s assume that the interaction causes the probability to decrease by a factor of r. Then, N_B = D_B * (p / r) and N_K = D_K * (p / r). The ratio of plumes would then be (D_B / D_K) * (1/r) = (1e7 / 1e5) * (1/r) = 100/r. From the observed data, N_B/N_K = 40/4 = 10. So 100/r =10 \u21d2 r=10. Thus, the probability of infection decreases by a factor of 10. How does this relate to recombination? If the interaction reduces the probability by a factor of 10, it suggests that the recombination rate is high. The recombination frequency R is related to the probability of recombination occurring. If R is the proportion of the chromosome where the recombination has occurred, then the probability of recombination is approximately R/(1-R). For very low R, it approximates to R. But in this case, the probability of infection decreased by a factor of 10. If the interaction is due to recombination, then R would correspond to the fraction of DNA regions where recombination has occurred. However, without precise formulas, it's challenging to map R directly to the observed plume changes. Alternatively, considering the maximum possible recombination frequency that could account for the observed plume difference. If the plume count increased by a factor of 10 when moving from D_B=1e7 to D_K=1e5, it suggests that the interaction is highly significant. Given the answer options, the highest plausible value is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Since 90% is not among them, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the numbers again. The observed plume counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5. The ratio of plumes is 10, which aligns with the inverse ratio of dilution factors (1e5 / 1e7 = 1/10). So, N_B/N_K = 10. If N_B = D_B * (p + q - pq) and N_K = D_K * (p + q - pq), then N_B/N_K = (D_B / D_K) =10. Therefore, (1e7 / 1e5)=10= (D_B/D_K)=10. Hence, the plume counts are consistent with the interaction being solely due to the difference in dilution factors. This suggests that the recombination is happening at a rate that allows the interaction to occur despite the difference in dilution. Given that the recombination is happening on a small region, the frequency must be low. The options include J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Considering the calculated ratio, the recombination frequency is likely around 0.3% or slightly higher. Among the options, F (0.3%) is the closest. Therefore, the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. However, the key point here is the ratio of plumes on each strain. Strain B has 40 plumes, which is much higher than strain K's 4. Since the dilutions were different (1e7 vs 1e5), this might indicate that the phages from strain B are more likely to cause infections on strain B's lawn because their dilution was less concentrated. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple mutations increases the number of phages available, leading to more infections. But wait, the fact that both types are present complicates things. Maybe the combination leads to more interactions where the phages cause double infections or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down. Each half is treated separately. The first half is 1:1e7, meaning each well has 1e-7 of the bacterial population. Plated on strain B's lawn. The second half is 1:1e5, so more cells are plated. Then each plate shows either 4 or 40 plumes. Wait, no\u2014actually, the question says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" And then the same for strain K. So each half is a separate experiment. For the first half, treating with 1:1e7 phages on strain B's lawn. The result is some number of plumes, say X. Then the other half, treating with 1:1e5 phages on strain K's lawn, resulting in Y plumes. Finally, they plate both strains with the same concentration on their own laths. The numbers given are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact interpretation. Let me try to visualize this. So, when both types of phages are present, the E. coli grows on strain B's lawn. But why would that happen? Because the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, so it should survive and cause lysogeny instead of lysing. Therefore, the phages from strain B shouldn't be able to grow on strain B's lawn unless there's some interaction. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, they do grow because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the K strain. But why did some E. coli grow on strain K's lawn and others on strain B's? That suggests that the phages interact in a way that allows some growth on one strain but not the other. This could happen through recombination. Recombination would involve the movement of genetic material between phages or between phages and E. coli. If recombination occurs between the two types of phages, then the phages from strain B could potentially infect strain K's bacteria. Or vice versa. But the specific effect observed is that on strain B's lawn, there were 40 plumes, and on strain K's, 4. That seems like a significant difference. Normally, without any interference, the number of plumes would depend on the dilution factor and the probability of a single phage attacking the bacteria. The formula for calculating the expected number of plumes is N = (Dilution Factor) * (Probability of Infection). Assuming the probability of a single phage causing an infection is p, then N \u2248 D * p. For example, D=1e5 gives N\u2248p*1e5, and D=1e7 gives N\u2248p*1e7. Now, considering that both types of phages were present, the combined effect would influence the number of plumes. However, the observed difference between 40 and 4 plumes is quite large. Let's compute the ratio of plumes: 40 / 4 = 10 times. This suggests that the presence of strain B's phages caused ten times as many infections on strain B's lawn compared to strain K's. Given that the dilution factors are different, this implies that the presence of strain B's phages affects the growth on strain B's lawn, while the presence of strain K's phages affects the growth on strain K's lawn. This indicates that the two mutation types interact, possibly through recombination. To determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (RF) = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nBut in this case, the numbers of plumes suggest a certain level of interaction. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability of recombination using the formula:\n\np = sqrt( (N_B - N_K) / (N_B + N_K) )\n\nWhere N_B is the number of plumes on strain B's lawn, and N_K is on strain K's. Plugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/(40+4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818. Taking the square root gives approximately 0.904, which is about 90%. But this doesn't match any of the options provided. Perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to consider the likelihood of recombination based on the number of plumes. If there's significant interaction, the number of plumes might correlate with the degree of recombination. Alternatively, the problem may relate to the concept of double mutants or the interaction between two types of phages causing different outcomes on each strain. Another angle is to recognize that when both mutation types are present, the total number of possible interactions determines the outcome. The larger number of plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the phages from strain B are more effective at infecting strain B's bacteria, perhaps due to some recombination. The smaller number on strain K's lawn suggests that the phages from strain K are more effective at infecting strain K's bacteria. If the two phage types can coexist, it might lead to some form of interaction where the effectiveness depends on the relative concentrations. Alternatively, the number of plumes could be influenced by the efficiency of each type of phage. For instance, if the lysogenic phage is more efficient at infecting certain strains, its presence would increase the plume count on those strains. But in this case, the lysogenic phage from strain B shouldn't affect strain B's lawn because it doesn't lyse the target. It should instead cause lysogeny, leading to growth on strain K's lawn. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from strain K shouldn't affect strain B's lawn. But the observed result is that both strains grew, which contradicts this expectation. Therefore, the presence of both phages must allow for some interaction. Perhaps the lysogenic phage from strain B infects strain K's bacteria, creating a double mutant, while the lysogenic phage from strain K infects strain B's bacteria. The difference in plume counts reflects the relative effectiveness of these interactions. If the lysogenic phage from strain B infects strain K's bacteria, it would create a double mutant on strain K's lawn. Conversely, the lysogenic phage from strain K infects strain B's bacteria, creating a double mutant on strain B's lawn. The difference in plume counts would reflect the strength of these interactions. The larger number of plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the interaction is stronger on strain B's side, implying a higher degree of recombination. To estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\np = (sqrt(N_B + N_K) - sqrt(|N_B - N_K|)) / (sqrt(N_B) + sqrt(K))\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach is to realize that the number of plumes corresponds to the product of the probabilities of each phage causing an infection. If the two phages interact, the overall probability becomes p1 + p2 - p1*p2. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, the number of plumes can be modeled as N = (Dilution Factor) * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2). However, without knowing p1 and p2 individually, it's tricky. But given the observed differences, we can infer the degree of recombination. The fact that the lysogenic phage from strain B causes more plumes on strain B's lawn suggests that the interaction is strong enough to produce a higher number of double mutants on strain B's lawn. The difference in plume counts is 36, which is almost all of the plumes on strain B's lawn. On strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes are found, suggesting minimal interaction or no interaction at all. This discrepancy suggests that most of the phages from strain B are interacting with strain K's phages, leading to some double mutants on strain B's lawn but none on strain K's. Therefore, the recombination frequency is high. Looking back at the answer choices, the highest option is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). However, 90% seems too high for such a small region. Rechecking my calculations, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try again. The formula for recombination frequency is RF = sqrt( (N_B - N_K) / (N_B + N_K) ). Plugging in the numbers: (40 - 4)/(40+4)=36/44\u22480.818. Square root is ~0.904, which is about 90%, not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses (N_B + N_K)/(N_B - N_K). Let's see: (40+4)/(40-4)=44/36\u22481.222. Square root is ~1.105, which is over 100%, impossible. Alternatively, maybe the formula is RF = (N_B - N_K)/(N_B + N_K). Which brings us back to 0.818, which is 90%. Still not matching the options. Perhaps I misunderstood the experiment. The experiment involved two halves: one half with 1:1e7 phages on strain B's lawn, resulting in X plumes; the other half with 1:1e5 phages on strain K's lawn, resulting in Y plumes. Then they plated both strains with the same concentration on their respective laths, resulting in 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, this might imply that the original plating had some background noise, and now they're adding the same plating to both strains' laths. So perhaps the initial plating (on B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and the initial plating (on K's lawn) had 4 plumes. Then they added the same plating to both strains' laths, resulting in 40 on B and 4 on K. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the initial plating on B's lawn had 40 plumes, and on K's lawn had 4. Then they add the same plating quantity to both strains' laths, which would dilute the existing plumes further. But the question states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. So perhaps the initial plating (on B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and when added to strain K's lawn, which had 4 plumes, the total became 40 and 4. But that still doesn't explain the recombination aspect. Alternatively, perhaps the original plating (on B's lawn) resulted in 40 plumes, and on K's lawn, the original plating resulted in 4. Then, when both strains are plated with the same concentration, the total plumes become 40 and 4. But this doesn't directly relate to recombination. Alternatively, the experiment may have been designed to observe the effect of combining the two mutation types on each strain's lawn, but the results showed varying plume counts indicating interaction. The key insight is that the presence of both mutation types significantly affects the growth on each strain's lawn, suggesting that the phages interact, leading to some double mutants. The recombination frequency would then be determined by comparing the plume frequencies. Since the difference is large (36 plumes), it suggests a high degree of interaction. Looking at the options, the highest recombination frequency is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). 90% is way beyond these. Perhaps the calculation needs to consider the dilution factors differently. Let's try recalculating using a different approach. The number of plumes on each strain's lawn is proportional to the dilution factor times the probability of infection. Suppose p is the probability of a single phage causing an infection. Then on strain B's lawn, N_B = D_B * p, and on strain K's lawn, N_K = D_K * p. But this assumes independent events, which may not hold if there's interaction. However, if the two phages interact, the actual probability might be different. Alternatively, the observed number of plumes could be explained by the interaction reducing the effective probability. Let\u2019s denote the recombination frequency as R. Then, the effective probability of infection could be p = p1 + p2 - p1*p2. Then, N_B = D_B * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) and N_K = D_K * (p1 + p2 - p1*p2). But without knowing p1 and p2, it's hard to solve. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes could give the ratio of probabilities. N_B/N_K = (D_B/D_K) * [ (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) / (p1 + p2 - p1*p2) ] \u2192 same ratio. Not helpful. Alternatively, focusing on the change from D_B=1e7 to D_K=1e5. The plume count goes up by a factor of 10 (from 40 to 4), which suggests that the increased dilution factor compensates for the reduced probability of infection. If the probability of infection decreases sufficiently with the increased dilution, the net effect on plume count can remain similar. Let\u2019s suppose that without interaction, the plume count on strain B's lawn would be D_B * p, and on strain K's lawn, D_K * p. With interaction, the plume count on B's lawn becomes D_B * (p + q - pq), and on K's lawn, D_K * (p + q - pq), where q is the contribution from the interaction. However, without knowing q, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction reduces the probability by a certain factor. Let\u2019s assume that the interaction causes the probability to decrease by a factor of r. Then, N_B = D_B * (p / r) and N_K = D_K * (p / r). The ratio of plumes would then be (D_B / D_K) * (1/r) = (1e7 / 1e5) * (1/r) = 100/r. From the observed data, N_B/N_K = 40/4 = 10. So 100/r =10 \u21d2 r=10. Thus, the probability of infection decreases by a factor of 10. How does this relate to recombination? If the interaction reduces the probability by a factor of 10, it suggests that the recombination rate is high. The recombination frequency R is related to the probability of recombination occurring.

The observed plume counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. The dilution factors are 1e7 and 1e5. The ratio of plumes is 10, which aligns with the inverse ratio of dilution factors (1e5 / 1e7 = 1/10). So, N_B/N_K = 10. If N_B = D_B * (p + q - pq) and N_K = D_K * (p + q - pq), then N_B/N_K = (D_B / D_K) =10. Therefore, (1e7 / 1e5)=10= (D_B/D_K)=10. Hence, the plume counts are consistent with the interaction being solely due to the difference in dilution factors. This suggests that the recombination is happening at a rate that allows the interaction to occur despite the difference in dilution.

On strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes appear, indicating fewer infections. The key here is the ratio of plumes between the two regions. This ratio should reflect the fitness or dominance of each mutation. Strain K has less plumes, suggesting it's more resistant or less susceptible. If the two mutations combined, we would expect the number of plumes to be somewhere between 4 and 40. But the numbers don't directly tell us the recombination rate. However, the recombination frequency refers to the proportion of double recombinants versus double crossovers or other types of interference. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency typically refers to the percentage of times two genes are inherited together due to crossover events. In this context, since the mutations affect phage lysis, which affects bacterial growth, the recombination could influence whether the lysogenic vs. lytic phages are expressed together. If there's complete recombination, both mutation types would function correctly. If no recombination, neither would work. However, in the given scenario, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, implying that the lytic phage didn't contribute enough to the problem. But wait, the question says \"the amount of recombination,\" which implies that both mutations are present, leading to some kind of interaction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment's design, the difference in plume counts could indicate the relative fitness of each mutation. The presence of strain K with fewer plumes suggests it's more resistant, while strain B has more plumes. The ratio of plumes can help determine the recombination frequency. In such experiments, the ratio of plumes expected under independent assortment would be around 1:1, but when recombination occurs, it can shift this ratio. For example, if there's partial recombination, the ratio might favor one strain over the other. \n\nGiven the data, when the phages are plated on strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, only 4.

The formula used to estimate recombination frequency is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (number of plumes)/(total possible plumes)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Another approach is that the expected number of plumes under recombination would depend on the initial frequencies of each mutation. Let's denote the frequency of the lysogenic phage as p and the lytic as q. If they undergo r% recombination, then the expected distribution depends on r. However, without knowing the initial frequencies, it's tricky. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can give an indication of the interference.

The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only strain B was bad with lysogenic phages, the presence of another type might cause a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination leads to a dominant mutation. \n\nThe results show that when the phages are plated on strain B's lawn, 40 plumes are observed, meaning 40 phages successfully infected the cells. On strain K's lawn, only 4 plumes appear, indicating fewer infections. The key here is the ratio of plumes between the two regions. This ratio should reflect the fitness or dominance of each mutation. Strain K has less plumes, suggesting it's more resistant or less susceptible. If the two mutations combined, we would expect the number of plumes to be somewhere between 4 and 40. But the numbers don't directly tell us the recombination rate. However, the recombination frequency refers to the proportion of double recombinants versus double crossovers or other types of interference. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination frequency typically refers to the percentage of times two genes are inherited together due to crossover events. In this context, since the mutations affect phage lysis, which affects bacterial growth, the recombination could influence whether the lysogenic vs. lytic phages are expressed together. If there's complete recombination, both mutation types would function correctly. If no recombination, neither would work. However, in the given scenario, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, implying that the lytic phage didn't contribute enough to the problem. But wait, the question says \"the amount of recombination,\" which implies that both mutations are present, leading to some kind of interaction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment's design, the difference in plume counts could indicate the relative fitness of each mutation. The presence of strain K with fewer plumes suggests it's more resistant, while strain B has more plumes. The ratio of plumes can help determine the recombination frequency. In such experiments, the ratio of plumes expected under independent assortment would be around 1:1, but when recombination occurs, it can shift this ratio. For example, if there's partial recombination, the ratio might favor one strain over the other. \n\nGiven the data, when the phages are plated on strain B, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K, only 4. If there's perfect independence, the ratio would be around 1:1, but since the phages are likely interacting, the actual ratio indicates the degree of recombination. The formula used to estimate recombination frequency is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (number of plumes)/(total possible plumes)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Another approach is that the expected number of plumes under recombination would depend on the initial frequencies of each mutation. Let's denote the frequency of the lysogenic phage as p and the lytic as q. If they undergo r% recombination, then the expected distribution depends on r. However, without knowing the initial frequencies, it's tricky. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can give an indication of the interference. If there's significant interference, like in some cases where one mutation suppresses the other, the ratio can point to the level of interference or recombination.\n\nIn the experiment, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective than the lytic phage, but I'm supposed to find the recombination frequency between them. Perhaps the formula to calculate the recombination frequency from the observed ratio is:\n\n( (p + q)^2 ) / (p*q) )\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can be used to estimate the interference, which relates to the recombination frequency. If the ratio is significantly different from 1, it suggests interference. However, without more specific information, it's challenging to apply this directly.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of both mutation types causing issues might suggest that their effects interfere. If they recombine, their combined effect is additive; otherwise, it's multiplicative. The observed difference in plume counts could indicate the extent of interference. \n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer seems to be F. 0.3 percent. This aligns with the idea that the mutations interact moderately, leading to the observed plume ratios.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The other half, with both mutations, had 4 plumes, which is even fewer than just B. That suggests that combining both mutations reduces the number of infections compared to using either alone, implying some form of negative interference or recombination. Recombination would lead to fewer phages causing damage because they don't cause independent fission as much. Now, the key here is figuring out the percentage of recombination. I remember that in recombinant DNA experiments, the efficiency is measured by the coefficient of coincidence, which accounts for the likelihood of two independent mutations occurring together. The formula is COI = observed / expected. For two mutations, without any recombination, the expected number would be based on the probability of each mutation occurring independently. If there's complete recombination, the efficiency increases because the two mutations work together, making them dependent rather than independent events. So, the expected COI would be the product of their individual efficiencies. Without recombination, each mutation has its own efficiency. Let me calculate that. Suppose each mutation has an efficiency of e. Then, the expected COI is e * e = e\u00b2. In our case, we need to find e, which is sqrt(COI). First, determine the observed COI. Since the first group had 40 plumes and the second had 4, the observed COI is 4/40 = 0.1. Now, assuming no recombination, each mutation would have been treated separately. Each mutation's efficiency can be calculated as follows: Let\u2019s say the concentration of each mutation type is C. Then, the expected number of plumes from each would be proportional to C times the efficiency. But since both mutations are present, the combined efficiency would be e_total = e1 * e2. The observed COI is e_total / (e1 * e2) if there's no recombination, but wait, that might not be correct. Actually, the observed COI should account for the combined effect. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations reduces the efficiency, perhaps the expected COI without recombination would be the product of the individual efficiencies. But without knowing the exact concentrations, maybe another approach is better. Let me think differently. The total number of plumes on B is 40, while on K it's 4. The ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the combination of both mutations leads to a lower probability of infection, indicating reduced interference. If there was complete recombination, the number of plumes would decrease exponentially relative to independent mutations. Alternatively, the coefficient of coincidence could help quantify this. Coefficient of coincidence (COI) measures the correlation between the occurrence of two mutations. It's given by COI = (observed frequency) / (expected frequency). Here, observed is 4, expected is 40, so COI = 4/40 = 0.1. To find the probability of recombination, we can use the formula related to COI. Assuming that without recombination, the expected COI would be zero, but in reality, it's positive. However, without recombination, the COI would be equal to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Wait, perhaps a better way is to model it as the probability of recombination being r, then the expected COI would be r * p1 * p2, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. But without knowing p1 and p2, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the dilution factor. So for the first group, with a high dilution factor, the number of plumes is low. Let me consider the relationship between COI and the degree of recombination. Another approach is to note that the ratio of plumes indicates the relative effectiveness of the mutations. Since the combination of both mutations led to fewer plumes, it suggests that their effects are somewhat overlapping or interfering. The ratio is 10:1, so the overall effect is tenfold more effective than either mutation alone, but in this case, it's four times more effective? Wait, no, the observed is 4 vs. 40, so 4 is 1/10 of 40. That suggests that combining both mutations reduces the infection rate by a factor of 10, which implies a high level of recombination. But how do we translate that into a percentage? Maybe using the formula: COI = e_total / (e1 * e2). Assuming e1 and e2 are the efficiencies of each mutation individually. Without recombination, e_total would be e1 * e2, leading to COI = 1. With recombination, e_total decreases, so COI </think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Alternatively, recombination might lead to a more stable phage, but in this case, strain B is primarily affected, which might imply that the lysogenic phage is dominant here. However, when both are present, maybe some of the phages from one type replicate and affect others, leading to a mosaic or recombinant phage population. The key here is that the presence of both mutants allows for cross-infection events, and the number of plasmids on each strain indicates the frequency of occurrence. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that when both types are present, the strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is dominant here. But when both are present, the other strain, K, has fewer plasmids. Hmm, wait no\u2014the phages would be present regardless, but their distribution depends on how they interact. Alternatively, the number of plasmids found on each strain could indicate how much of the recombinant phage population exists on each. In this case, strain B had 40 plasmids, and strain K had 4. Since 40 is significantly higher than 4, it implies that more of the phages that are recombinant are present on strain B. This suggests that recombination occurred in such a way that more of the recombined phage forms on strain B compared to strain K. Recombination typically reduces the variability in the recombinant population. Normally, without recombination, all recombinants would behave similarly, but with recombination, there would be a mix of different behaviors. The more recombination occurs, the fewer unique behaviors you'd expect among the phages, especially if the phages are either lysogenic or a single type. \n\nThe number of plasmids detected on each strain relates to the proportion of recombinant phages present. For example, if most of the recombinant phages are on strain B, then even though there's some recombination, the majority of the recombination hasn't spread to strain K. So the ratio of plasmids on B to K gives an idea of how much recombination happened. Here, 40 vs. 4 is a 10-fold difference, meaning 96% of the phages on B are recombinant compared to 25% on K. This high ratio suggests significant recombination. Now, how do we convert this into the percentage of recombination? Recombination frequency (RF) is often expressed as the probability that a recombination event occurs between two loci. In terms of plasmid counts, if the RF is high, say 8%, then the expected number of recombinant phages would depend on the initial frequency of those recombinants. However, in this case, the observed ratio is much higher than typical values. Usually, if the RF is 5%, you might see around 10-20% of the recombinant phages being on each strain. Here, the ratio is almost four times higher, suggesting a much higher RF than usual. \n\nBut wait, another approach is to calculate the likelihood of the observed plasmid distribution given a certain RF. Let's denote the RF as 'p'. The expected number of recombinant phages on B would be higher than on K. The formula for the expected number of recombinant phages on each strain can be approximated using the product rule of independent assortment. So, for strain B, the expected number would be p*(N), where N is the total number of phages. Similarly, for strain K, it would be (1-p)*N. The ratio of plasmids on B to K would then be [p*N]/[(1-p)*N] = p/(1-p). Given that the ratio is 40/4=10, so p/(1-p)=10 \u2192 p=10/(11)\u22480.909, which is approximately 90.9%. But none of the answer choices go up to 90%. The highest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). This suggests that my approach might be incorrect. Perhaps instead, the recombination frequency refers to the percentage of recombinant phages relative to the total population. If the ratio is 10:1, that means 10% of the phages are recombinant. But since the problem states \"the amount of recombination,\" I'm not sure if it's referring to the percentage of recombinants or the RF itself. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on each strain is proportional to the number of recombinant phages, and the higher number on B suggests more recombination. But the options don't include 90. Maybe I should consider that the recombination frequency is calculated differently. Another thought is that the number of plasmids detected corresponds to the number of recombinant phages multiplied by a factor due to dilution. If the dilution factor is 1e7 for B and 1e5 for K, the density of plasmids increases for B, making it easier to detect more of the recombinant phages. However, the exact calculation isn't straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a higher incidence of recombinant phages on B, indicating a higher recombination rate. If the expected ratio under normal circumstances (no recombination) would be 1:1, but with recombination, it's skewed. However, without knowing the baseline, it's hard to calculate. Maybe the correct approach is to use the fact that the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1, which implies that 9 out of 10 phages are recombinant on B. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be 90%, but again, that's not among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is to recognize that the presence of both mutants leads to more recombination, hence higher frequency. Looking at the options, the closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%), but neither matches 90%. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%), assuming that the recombination frequency is 5%, which would make the expected ratio of recombinants on B to K as 5/5=1, but that contradicts the data. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is 5%, the expected ratio would be 5/(100-5)=5/95\u22485.26%, which is closer to 5%. But our observed ratio is 10:1. Hmm. Maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the correct approach is to model the expected number of recombinant phages on each strain given a recombination frequency 'f.' The expected number on B would be higher than on K by a factor of (1 + f)/ (1 - f), but this seems too vague. Without precise formulas, it's challenging. Alternatively, looking back, the correct approach might involve calculating the frequency of the recombinant phages based on the plasmid counts. If 40 out of 40+4=44 total plasmids on B are recombinant, then the frequency is 40/44\u224890.9%, which again isn't an option. The closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). It's possible that the intended answer is C (1.5%) because sometimes recombination frequencies are reported as percentages of the total, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%), but those are very low. Alternatively, maybe the correct interpretation is that the number of plasmids indicates the number of recombinant phages, and the ratio reflects the RF. For example, if the RF is 90%, then the expected number on B would be 90% more than K. But without a direct formula, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering that the ratio is 10:1, which could imply a RF of 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G (0.5%), assuming that the RF is the square root of 10, which is roughly 3.16, but rounded to 3%, but that's still not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%), thinking that the RF is 5%, which would give an expected ratio of 5/(100-5)=~5.26%, which is close to 5.26%, so rounding to 5% makes sense. But in our case, the ratio is 10:1, so perhaps the answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or method. Upon reflection, the correct approach is likely that the recombination frequency is determined by the number of recombinant phages. Since the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1, the expected recombination frequency is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is H (5%) because it's a common approximation used in exams. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G (0.5%) because the number of plasmids detected is 4, which is 25% of 16, but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, considering that the dilution factor affects the plasmid count inversely, the actual number of phages is higher on B (dilution factor 1e7) but fewer on K (1e5). Thus, the number of phages on B is higher, so the higher ratio suggests more recombination. But without knowing the baseline, it's hard to pin down the exact percentage. However, given the options, the closest plausible answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%), but those seem too low. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). But again, without clear evidence, it's difficult. Considering all possibilities, perhaps the intended answer is G (0.5%) or H (5%), but I'm inclined towards G because 0.5% is a common choice in some contexts.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Since 40 is significantly higher than 4, it implies that more of the phages that are recombinant are present on strain B. This suggests that recombination occurred in such a way that more of the recombined phage forms on strain B compared to strain K. Recombination typically reduces the variability in the recombinant population. Normally, without recombination, all recombinants would behave similarly, but with recombination, there would be a mix of different behaviors. The more recombination occurs, the fewer unique behaviors you'd expect among the phages, especially if the phages are either lysogenic or a single type. \n\nThe number of plasmids detected on each strain relates to the proportion of recombinant phages present. For example, if most of the recombinant phages are on strain B, then even though there's some recombination, the majority of the recombination hasn't spread to strain K. So the ratio of plasmids on B to K gives an idea of how much recombination happened. Here, 40 vs. 4 is a 10-fold difference, meaning 96% of the phages on B are recombinant compared to 25% on K. This high ratio suggests significant recombination. Now, how do we convert this into the percentage of recombination? Recombination frequency (RF) is often expressed as the probability that a recombination event occurs between two loci. In terms of plasmid counts, if the RF is high, say 8%, then the expected number of recombinant phages would depend on the initial frequency of those recombinants. However, in this case, the observed ratio is much higher than typical values. Usually, if the RF is 5%, you might see around 10-20% of the recombinant phages being on each strain. Here, the ratio is almost four times higher, suggesting a much higher RF than usual. \n\nBut wait, another approach is to calculate the likelihood of the observed plasmid distribution given a certain RF. Let's denote the RF as 'p'. The expected number of recombinant phages on B would be higher than on K. The formula for the expected number of recombinant phages on each strain can be approximated using the product rule of independent assortment. So, for strain B, the expected number would be p*(N), where N is the total number of phages. Similarly, for strain K, it would be (1-p)*N. The ratio of plasmids on B to K would then be [p*N]/[(1-p)*N] = p/(1-p). Given that the ratio is 40/4=10, so p/(1-p)=10 \u2192 p=10/(11)\u22480.909, which is approximately 90.9%. But none of the answer choices go up to 90%. The highest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). This suggests that my approach might be incorrect. Perhaps instead, the recombination frequency refers to the percentage of recombinant phages relative to the total population. If the ratio is 10:1, that means 10% of the phages are recombinant. But since the problem states \"the amount of recombination,\" I'm not sure if it's referring to the percentage of recombinants or the RF itself. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on each strain is proportional to the number of recombinant phages, and the higher number on B suggests more recombination. But the options don't include 90. Maybe I should consider that the recombination frequency is calculated differently. Another thought is that the number of plasmids detected corresponds to the number of recombinant phages multiplied by a factor due to dilution. If the dilution factor is 1e7 for B and 1e5 for K, the density of plasmids increases for B, making it easier to detect more of the recombinant phages. However, the exact calculation isn't straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to a higher incidence of recombinant phages on B, indicating a higher recombination rate. If the expected ratio under normal circumstances (no recombination) would be 1:1, but with recombination, it's skewed. However, without knowing the baseline, it's hard to calculate. Maybe the correct approach is to use the fact that the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1, which implies that 9 out of 10 phages are recombinant on B. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be 90%, but again, that's not among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is to recognize that the presence of both mutants leads to more recombination, hence higher frequency. Looking at the options, the closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%), but neither matches 90%. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%), assuming that the recombination frequency is 5%, which would make the expected ratio of recombinants on B to K as 5/5=1, but that contradicts the data. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is 5%, the expected ratio would be 5/(100-5)=5/95\u22485.26%, which is closer to 5%. But our observed ratio is 10:1. Hmm. Maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the correct approach is to model the expected number of recombinant phages on each strain given a recombination frequency 'f.' The expected number on B would be higher than on K by a factor of (1 + f)/ (1 - f), but this seems too vague. Without precise formulas, it's challenging. Alternatively, looking back, the correct approach might involve calculating the frequency of the recombinant phages based on the plasmid counts. If 40 out of 40+4=44 total plasmids on B are recombinant, then the frequency is 40/44\u224890.9%, which again isn't an option. The closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). It's possible that the intended answer is C (1.5%) because sometimes recombination frequencies are reported as percentages of the total, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%), but those are very low. Alternatively, maybe the correct interpretation is that the number of plasmids indicates the number of recombinant phages, and the ratio reflects the RF. For example, if the RF is 90%, then the expected number on B would be 90% more than K. But without a direct formula, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering that the ratio is 10:1, which could imply a RF of 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G (0.5%), assuming that the RF is the square root of 10, which is roughly 3.16, but rounded to 3%, but that's still not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%), thinking that the RF is 5%, which would give an expected ratio of 5/(100-5)=~5.26%, which is close to 5.26%, so rounding to 5% makes sense. But in our case, the ratio is 10:1, so perhaps the answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or method. Upon reflection, the correct approach is likely that the recombination frequency is determined by the number of recombinant phages. Since the ratio of plasmids on B to K is 10:1, the expected recombination frequency is 90%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is H (5%) because it's a common approximation used in exams. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G (0.5%) because the number of plasmids detected is 4, which is 25% of 16, but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, considering that the dilution factor affects the plasmid count inversely, the actual number of phages is higher on B (dilution factor 1e7) but fewer on K (1e5). Thus, the number of phages on B is higher, so the higher ratio suggests more recombination. But without knowing the baseline, it's hard to pin down the exact percentage. However, given the options, the closest plausible answer is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%), but those seem too low. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). But again, without clear evidence, it's difficult. Considering all possibilities, perhaps the intended answer is G (0.5%) or H (5%), but I'm inclined towards G because 0.5% is a common choice in some contexts.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The key here is figuring out how much of the recombination occurred.",
    "rollout": " The key here is figuring out how much of the recombination occurred. Recombination would lead to the combination of the two mutations, resulting in a double mutation, which should cause both types of phages to fail. But in reality, sometimes only one type might be effective due to incomplete recombination or selection. However, in this case, since both types are present, the effect is more pronounced. The initial division resulted in half being tested on strain B and the other on strain K. Then those halves were further diluted. \n\nLet me recall some basic phage testing principles. When you plate a mixture of mutants on a strain, the outcome depends on whether they interact. If two mutants interact, their offspring would have a new mutation that confers a selective advantage, leading to a higher rate of infection. This is known as positive interference. Positive interference reduces the observed number of successful invasions compared to independent events. For example, if two mutants have a high degree of recombination, they may produce a dominant mutant that is less fit, thus reducing the likelihood of additional infections beyond the point where each individual mutant alone would have been effective.\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of both mutant types leads to a saturation point, meaning that at a certain level of phage density, more phages don't result in more infections. The plateau indicates that the phages are interfering with each other. The fact that half the population was effectively cleared (inhalation) on strain B suggests that the lysogenic phage caused issues, but the other half was cleared on strain K. This implies that the lysogenic phage is more effective against strain K, suggesting some interaction.\n\nThe dilution factors used are important. The first half was plated at a higher dilution (1e7), so fewer cells were exposed, making it harder for the phages to reach them. The second half was plated at a lower dilution (1e5), exposing more cells. However, the results showed that when the phages from both mutants were combined, the effect was different than either alone. Since the lysogenic phage alone causes problems, combining them might have led to a situation where their offspring are less viable, causing interference.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, when you plate a mixture, you expect a certain number of plumes depending on the interaction. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is causing issues, the lysogenic ones might be more common. Alternatively, the presence of both types might reduce the effectiveness of either, leading to a higher rate of clearing in one strain but lower in another. The exact interpretation requires knowing how the numbers relate to the expected outcomes.\n\nAnother approach: think about the probability of successful infection. If the two mutations are completely independent, the probability of both happening would be p1 * p2. If they interfere, then it might be less. However, in phage experiments, the actual number of plumes can tell us about the interaction. If both mutations are present, the number of plumes increases, but only up to a point before negative interference occurs. Negative interference is when a single mutation affects the fitness of the phages carrying another mutation, leading to reduced success rates.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for negative interference. The number of plumes (n) is given by n = m1 + m2 - c(m1)(m2), where c(m1) is the coefficient of negative interference. But without knowing the coefficients, it's tricky. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can indicate the degree of recombination. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider that the number of plumes corresponds to the product of the probabilities. If the two mutations are perfectly recombinant, their offspring would have a dominant mutation that confers a fitness penalty. Therefore, the probability of such a mutation occurring would determine the number of plumes.\n\nAlternatively, considering the results: 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems like a significant difference. Maybe the lysogenic phage (causing issues) is more common. So when you mix the two mutants, the lysogenic phage, which was already causing issues, plus the lysogenic again? Or perhaps the combination led to a new mutation that confers a selective advantage, thereby reducing the number of plumes.\n\nWait, the original problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. So maybe the lysogenic phage is more effective, and mixing them leads to a new mutation that makes the phage even worse. But in the experiment, the lysogenic phage is already causing issues, so adding more lysogenic phages might not help. Instead, perhaps the two mutations interfere, leading to a situation where the lysogenic phage can't replicate efficiently, causing failure.\n\nBut the specific counts: 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm. Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was placed on B's lawn, and the second on K's. The first half had a higher dilution (1e7) leading to fewer plumes, but the second half had a lower dilution (1e5) leading to more plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a higher dilution would mean fewer cells are plated, so fewer potential infections. But in reality, if the phage is already causing issues, perhaps the number of plumes isn't directly proportional to the dilution. Alternatively, perhaps the test shows that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes is higher on K, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more common there, implying that the lysogenic phage is better adapted to K. That could happen if there's positive interference, where the presence of the lysogenic phage in K's cells selects against it, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to replicate in B's cells, while more are present in K's. Therefore, when the phages from both strains are mixed, the lysogenic phages from B are more likely to find themselves in K's cells, where they are less fit, leading to fewer plumes overall. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations have some degree of positive interference, causing the lysogenic phage to be under selection in K's cells, thus reducing its frequency and leading to fewer plumes. To quantify the degree of recombination needed to achieve this interference, we can use the formula for negative interference:\n\nNumber of plumes (n) = m1 + m2 - c(m1)*m2\n\nWhere c(m1) is the coefficient of negative interference. Rearranging gives:\n\nc(m1) = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nWe have n = 40 on B and m1 = 40 on K. Wait, no, the first sample (B) has n=40 plumes, and the second sample (K) has m1=4 plumes. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- First sample: Plated on B's lawn with a certain dilution (say, 1e7). The number of plumes detected is 40.\n- Second sample: Plated on K's lawn with a lower dilution (1e5). The number of plumes detected is 4.\n\nSo the first sample (plated on B) detected 40 plumes, and the second sample (plated on K) detected 4 plumes. Now, if the two mutants are interacting, the presence of one mutation might affect the replication of the other, leading to reduced efficiency. Assuming that the lysogenic phage is more effective against K's cells, this could be due to positive interference, where the presence of the lysogenic phage in K's cells reduces its own replication, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to replicate elsewhere. \n\nTo calculate the coefficient of negative interference (c), we can use the formula:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n) / m2\n\nHere, m1 is the number of plumes on K's lawn, m2 is the total number of plumes on B's lawn, n is the number on K, and m1 + m2 is the total plumes across both samples. Wait, but in this context, m1 is the number of plumes on K, and m2 is the total plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. Perhaps it's better to think that m1 is the count on K, and m2 is the count on B. But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again.\n\nAssuming that the coefficient of negative interference is c, and using the formula:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nRearranged:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm1 = 4 (on K)\nm2 = 40 (on B)\nn = ?\n\nWait, but the problem states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. Wait, that's inconsistent because if n is the total plumes across both samples, then n = 4 + 40 = 44. But according to the formula, n = m1 + m2 - c*m2, so substituting:\n\n44 = 4 + 40 - c*40\n44 = 44 - 40c\nSubtracting 44 from both sides:\n0 = -40c\nWhich implies c=0, which doesn't make sense because there must be some interference. So perhaps I've misunderstood the variables. Maybe m1 is the number of plumes on K, and m2 is the number on B, but the formula needs to account for both together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the total number of plumes (m_total) is m1 + m2, and the number of plumes detected on B is n = m_total - c*m2, assuming that each plume individually contributes to the detection, except for the ones that are selected against. So solving for c:\n\nc = (m_total - n)/m2\n\nGiven that m_total = 40 (from K) + 40 (from B?) Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first sample was on B's lawn with m1=40 plumes, and the second sample was on K's lawn with m2=4 plumes. So m_total = 40 + 4 = 44. And n is the number on K, which is 4. So,\n\nc = (44 - 4)/4 = 40/4 = 10\n\nBut this is impossible because c cannot exceed 1. So clearly, my assumptions are wrong. Maybe m1 is the number on K, m2 is the number on B, and n is the total plumes. Wait, but the problem states that 40 plumes were found on B and 4 on K. It's unclear whether these are the totals or separate counts.\n\nPerhaps instead, the correct formula is:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nAnd rearranged to solve for c:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nIf we take n as the total plumes, which is 40+4=44, m1=4, m2=40:\n\nc = (4 + 40 - 44)/40 = (0)/40 = 0\n\nAgain, zero interference, which isn't possible. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat m1 as the number on K's lawn and m2 as the number on B's lawn, but that still doesn't resolve the issue. Maybe I need to look for another angle.\n\nAlternative approach: the presence of both mutations leads to interference, which affects the number of plumes. Interference can be quantified by the formula:\n\nInterference = (number of plumes without interference) / (number of plumes with interference)\n\nIf there's positive interference, the number without interference is higher, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSuppose the expected number of plumes without interference is m1 + m2. With interference, it's less. Using the formula:\n\nExpected = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nIf the observed n is less than expected, that indicates interference.\n\nIn our case, n is the number on K's lawn. Suppose that without interference, all lysogenic phages from B would infect K as well, but with interference, only part of them do. Alternatively, the formula might be applied differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is causing issues on both strains, the interference could be modeled by the equation:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n) / m2\n\nBut earlier substitution gave c=10, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting m1 and m2. Maybe m1 is the number on K, m2 is the number on B, and n is the number on B. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So, 4 on K and 40 on B. So, perhaps the total number of plumes is 44, but the distribution is 4 on K and 40 on B. But that doesn't align with the model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nWhere n is the number on B (4), m1 is the number on K (40), and m2 is the total plumes (40 + 4=44). Solving for c:\n\n4 = 40 + 44 - c*44\n4 = 84 - 44c\nSubtract 84:\n-80 = -44c\nDivide both sides by -44:\nc \u2248 1.818\n\nThat's over 1, which isn't possible because c represents the fraction of matched pairs that are failed, so it shouldn't exceed 1. Hence, this approach also doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps the number of plumes relates to the number of mutations or recombination events. If the two mutations are partially overlapping, the number of recombination points determines the degree of interference. However, without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the possibility that the two mutations form a recombinant chromosome that confers a dominant lethal phenotype, leading to reduced survival. The presence of this recombinant mutation would decrease the number of survivors, hence reducing the number of plumes because fewer phages survive to infect the target cells.\n\nIf the two mutations are partially overlapping, the number of possible recombination points increases, leading to a higher degree of interference. The higher the number of recombination points, the stronger the interference, and the larger the drop in the number of plumes.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes decreases significantly from 40 on B to 4 on K. The drop from 40 to 4 suggests a large reduction, which could correspond to a high degree of recombination. Looking at the answer options, option D is 0.05%, which is quite low. Option F is 0.3%. Option G is 0.5%.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is high, say around 50% or more, the interference would be strong. However, the numbers suggest a much lower interference, possibly due to complete overlap rather than partial. Alternatively, the disruption of the lysogenic phage's replication could result in a high degree of interference.\n\nBut without precise calculations, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, given the numbers, a high degree of recombination would explain why the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on K, leading to fewer plumes on K despite the same dilution. This suggests that the two mutations have created a dominant lethal phenotype, reducing the fitness of the phages, thereby causing interference.\n\nIn terms of the answer choices, the highest plausible value among the options is 0.5% (option F). However, considering that the interference might not be extremely high, perhaps closer to 0.3% (option G). But without more detailed analysis, it's challenging to choose definitively.\n\nAnother thought: the initial presence of both mutations causes the lysogenic phages to die because they can't replicate effectively, leading to fewer plumes. The exact degree of this repression depends on the degree of recombination. If there's complete recombination (no inversion), the death rate could be higher, but if there's partial recombination, the effect is moderate.\n\nConsidering that the number of plumes drops from 40 to 4, which is a 95% reduction, this suggests a very strong interference mechanism. However, none of the options go that high. The closest higher option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Given that recombination typically affects the number of plumes multiplicatively, a moderately high degree of recombination could cause such a significant drop.\n\nHowever, another perspective is that the recombination might not have a direct multiplicative effect on the number of plumes but rather on the probability of the lysogenic phage surviving. If the two mutations create a lethal pathway, the survival rate of lysogenic phages could be drastically reduced, leading to a lower number of plumes. The extent of this reduction depends on the degree of recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are nearly identical (high recombination), the survival rate could be almost zero, leading to a massive reduction in plumes. Conversely, if there's little recombination, the survival rate remains high, and the number of plumes is similar. Given that the number of plumes dropped to 4, which is a significant reduction, the degree of recombination must be substantial.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest plausible value is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Without more precise calculation, it's challenging to decide, but considering that interference is often measured in terms of the coefficient of negative interference, a high coefficient would imply a high degree of recombination.\n\nTherefore, I'll lean towards option G (0.5%) as the most reasonable answer, acknowledging that without precise calculations, it's an educated guess.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The key here is figuring out how much of the recombination occurred. Recombination would lead to the combination of the two mutations, resulting in a double mutation, which should cause both types of phages to fail. But in reality, sometimes only one type might be effective due to incomplete recombination or selection. However, in this case, since both types are present, the effect is more pronounced. The initial division resulted in half being tested on strain B and the other on strain K. Then those halves were further diluted. \n\nLet me recall some basic phage testing principles. When you plate a mixture of mutants on a strain, the outcome depends on whether they interact. If two mutants interact, their offspring would have a new mutation that confers a selective advantage, leading to a higher rate of infection. This is known as positive interference. Positive interference reduces the observed number of successful invasions compared to independent events. For example, if two mutants have a high degree of recombination, they may produce a dominant mutant that is less fit, thus reducing the likelihood of additional infections beyond the point where each individual mutant alone would have been effective.\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of both mutant types leads to a saturation point, meaning that at a certain level of phage density, more phages don't result in more infections. The plateau indicates that the phages are interfering with each other. The fact that half the population was effectively cleared (inhalation) on strain B suggests that the lysogenic phage caused issues, but the other half was cleared on strain K. This implies that the lysogenic phage is more effective against strain K, suggesting some interaction.\n\nThe dilution factors used are important. The first half was plated at a higher dilution (1e7), so fewer cells were exposed, making it harder for the phages to reach them. The second half was plated at a lower dilution (1e5), exposing more cells. However, the results showed that when the phages from both mutants were combined, the effect was different than either alone. Since the lysogenic phage alone causes problems, combining them might have led to a situation where their offspring are less viable, causing interference.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, when you plate a mixture, you expect a certain number of plumes depending on the interaction. In this case, since the lysogenic phage is causing issues, the lysogenic ones might be more common. Alternatively, the presence of both types might reduce the effectiveness of either, leading to a higher rate of clearing in one strain but lower in another. The exact interpretation requires knowing how the numbers relate to the expected outcomes.\n\nAnother approach: think about the probability of successful infection. If the two mutations are completely independent, the probability of both happening would be p1 * p2. If they interfere, then it might be less. However, in phage experiments, the actual number of plumes can tell us about the interaction. If both mutations are present, the number of plumes increases, but only up to a point before negative interference occurs. Negative interference is when a single mutation affects the fitness of the phages carrying another mutation, leading to reduced success rates.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for negative interference. The number of plumes (n) is given by n = m1 + m2 - c(m1)(m2), where c(m1) is the coefficient of negative interference. But without knowing the coefficients, it's tricky. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes can indicate the degree of recombination. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider that the number of plumes corresponds to the product of the probabilities. If the two mutations are perfectly recombinant, their offspring would have a dominant mutation that confers a fitness penalty. Therefore, the probability of such a mutation occurring would determine the number of plumes.\n\nAlternatively, considering the results: 4 on K and 40 on B. That seems like a significant difference. Maybe the lysogenic phage (causing issues) is more common. So when you mix the two mutants, the lysogenic phage, which was already causing issues, plus the lysogenic again? Or perhaps the combination led to a new mutation that confers a selective advantage, thereby reducing the number of plumes.\n\nWait, the original problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. So maybe the lysogenic phage is more effective, and mixing them leads to a new mutation that makes the phage even worse. But in the experiment, the lysogenic phage is already causing issues, so adding more lysogenic phages might not help. Instead, perhaps the two mutations interfere, leading to a situation where the lysogenic phage can't replicate efficiently, causing failure.\n\nBut the specific counts: 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm. Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was placed on B's lawn, and the second on K's. The first half had a higher dilution (1e7) leading to fewer plumes, but the second half had a lower dilution (1e5) leading to more plumes. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a higher dilution would mean fewer cells are plated, so fewer potential infections. But in reality, if the phage is already causing issues, perhaps the number of plumes isn't directly proportional to the dilution. Alternatively, perhaps the test shows that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes is higher on K, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more common there, implying that the lysogenic phage is better adapted to K. That could happen if there's positive interference, where the presence of the lysogenic phage in K's cells selects against it, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to replicate in B's cells, while more are present in K's. Therefore, when the phages from both strains are mixed, the lysogenic phages from B are more likely to find themselves in K's cells, where they are less fit, leading to fewer plumes overall. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations have some degree of positive interference, causing the lysogenic phage to be under selection in K's cells, thus reducing its frequency and leading to fewer plumes. To quantify the degree of recombination needed to achieve this interference, we can use the formula for negative interference:\n\nNumber of plumes (n) = m1 + m2 - c(m1)*m2\n\nWhere c(m1) is the coefficient of negative interference. Rearranging gives:\n\nc(m1) = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nWe have n = 40 on B and m1 = 40 on K. Wait, no, the first sample (B) has n=40 plumes, and the second sample (K) has m1=4 plumes. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- First sample: Plated on B's lawn with a certain dilution (say, 1e7). The number of plumes detected is 40.\n- Second sample: Plated on K's lawn with a lower dilution (1e5). The number of plumes detected is 4.\n\nSo the first sample (plated on B) detected 40 plumes, and the second sample (plated on K) detected 4 plumes. Now, if the two mutants are interacting, the presence of one mutation might affect the replication of the other, leading to reduced efficiency. Assuming that the lysogenic phage is more effective against K's cells, this could be due to positive interference, where the presence of the lysogenic phage in K's cells reduces its own replication, leaving fewer lysogenic phages to replicate elsewhere. \n\nTo calculate the coefficient of negative interference (c), we can use the formula:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n) / m2\n\nHere, m1 is the number of plumes on K's lawn, m2 is the total number of plumes on B's lawn, n is the number on K, and m1 + m2 is the total plumes across both samples. Wait, but in this context, m1 is the number of plumes on K, and m2 is the total plumes on B. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. Perhaps it's better to think that m1 is the count on K, and m2 is the count on B. But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again.\n\nAssuming that the coefficient of negative interference is c, and using the formula:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nRearranged:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm1 = 4 (on K)\nm2 = 40 (on B)\nn = ?\n\nWait, but the problem states that four plumes are found on K and 40 on B. Wait, that's inconsistent because if n is the total plumes across both samples, then n = 4 + 40 = 44. But according to the formula, n = m1 + m2 - c*m2, so substituting:\n\n44 = 4 + 40 - c*40\n44 = 44 - 40c\nSubtracting 44 from both sides:\n0 = -40c\nWhich implies c=0, which doesn't make sense because there must be some interference. So perhaps I've misunderstood the variables. Maybe m1 is the number of plumes on K, and m2 is the number on B, but the formula needs to account for both together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the total number of plumes (m_total) is m1 + m2, and the number of plumes detected on B is n = m_total - c*m2, assuming that each plume individually contributes to the detection, except for the ones that are selected against. So solving for c:\n\nc = (m_total - n)/m2\n\nGiven that m_total = 40 (from K) + 40 (from B?) Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first sample was on B's lawn with m1=40 plumes, and the second sample was on K's lawn with m2=4 plumes. So m_total = 40 + 4 = 44. And n is the number on K, which is 4. So,\n\nc = (44 - 4)/4 = 40/4 = 10\n\nBut this is impossible because c cannot exceed 1. So clearly, my assumptions are wrong. Maybe m1 is the number on K, m2 is the number on B, and n is the total plumes. Wait, but the problem states that 40 plumes were found on B and 4 on K. It's unclear whether these are the totals or separate counts.\n\nPerhaps instead, the correct formula is:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nAnd rearranged to solve for c:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n)/m2\n\nIf we take n as the total plumes, which is 40+4=44, m1=4, m2=40:\n\nc = (4 + 40 - 44)/40 = (0)/40 = 0\n\nAgain, zero interference, which isn't possible. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat m1 as the number on K's lawn and m2 as the number on B's lawn, but that still doesn't resolve the issue. Maybe I need to look for another angle.\n\nAlternative approach: the presence of both mutations leads to interference, which affects the number of plumes. Interference can be quantified by the formula:\n\nInterference = (number of plumes without interference) / (number of plumes with interference)\n\nIf there's positive interference, the number without interference is higher, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nSuppose the expected number of plumes without interference is m1 + m2. With interference, it's less. Using the formula:\n\nExpected = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nIf the observed n is less than expected, that indicates interference.\n\nIn our case, n is the number on K's lawn. Suppose that without interference, all lysogenic phages from B would infect K as well, but with interference, only part of them do. Alternatively, the formula might be applied differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage is causing issues on both strains, the interference could be modeled by the equation:\n\nc = (m1 + m2 - n) / m2\n\nBut earlier substitution gave c=10, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting m1 and m2. Maybe m1 is the number on K, m2 is the number on B, and n is the number on B. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So, 4 on K and 40 on B. So, perhaps the total number of plumes is 44, but the distribution is 4 on K and 40 on B. But that doesn't align with the model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nn = m1 + m2 - c*m2\n\nWhere n is the number on B (4), m1 is the number on K (40), and m2 is the total plumes (40 + 4=44). Solving for c:\n\n4 = 40 + 44 - c*44\n4 = 84 - 44c\nSubtract 84:\n-80 = -44c\nDivide both sides by -44:\nc \u2248 1.818\n\nThat's over 1, which isn't possible because c represents the fraction of matched pairs that are failed, so it shouldn't exceed 1. Hence, this approach also doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps the number of plumes relates to the number of mutations or recombination events. If the two mutations are partially overlapping, the number of recombination points determines the degree of interference. However, without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the possibility that the two mutations form a recombinant chromosome that confers a dominant lethal phenotype, leading to reduced survival. The presence of this recombinant mutation would decrease the number of survivors, hence reducing the number of plumes because fewer phages survive to infect the target cells.\n\nIf the two mutations are partially overlapping, the number of possible recombination points increases, leading to a higher degree of interference. The higher the number of recombination points, the stronger the interference, and the larger the drop in the number of plumes.\n\nIn this case, the number of plumes decreases significantly from 40 on B to 4 on K. The drop from 40 to 4 suggests a large reduction, which could correspond to a high degree of recombination. Looking at the answer options, option D is 0.05%, which is quite low. Option F is 0.3%. Option G is 0.5%.\n\nIf the recombination fraction is high, say around 50% or more, the interference would be strong. However, the numbers suggest a much lower interference, possibly due to complete overlap rather than partial. Alternatively, the disruption of the lysogenic phage's replication could result in a high degree of interference.\n\nBut without precise calculations, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, given the numbers, a high degree of recombination would explain why the lysogenic phage is more prevalent on K, leading to fewer plumes on K despite the same dilution. This suggests that the two mutations have created a dominant lethal phenotype, reducing the fitness of the phages, thereby causing interference.\n\nIn terms of the answer choices, the highest plausible value among the options is 0.5% (option F). However, considering that the interference might not be extremely high, perhaps closer to 0.3% (option G). But without more detailed analysis, it's challenging to choose definitively.\n\nAnother thought: the initial presence of both mutations causes the lysogenic phages to die because they can't replicate effectively, leading to fewer plumes. The exact degree of this repression depends on the degree of recombination. If there's complete recombination (no inversion), the death rate could be higher, but if there's partial recombination, the effect is moderate.\n\nConsidering that the number of plumes drops from 40 to 4, which is a 95% reduction, this suggests a very strong interference mechanism. However, none of the options go that high. The closest higher option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Given that recombination typically affects the number of plumes multiplicatively, a moderately high degree of recombination could cause such a significant drop.\n\nHowever, another perspective is that the recombination might not have a direct multiplicative effect on the number of plumes but rather on the probability of the lysogenic phage surviving. If the two mutations create a lethal pathway, the survival rate of lysogenic phages could be drastically reduced, leading to a lower number of plumes. The extent of this reduction depends on the degree of recombination.\n\nIf the two mutations are nearly identical (high recombination), the survival rate could be almost zero, leading to a massive reduction in plumes. Conversely, if there's little recombination, the survival rate remains high, and the number of plumes is similar. Given that the number of plumes dropped to 4, which is a significant reduction, the degree of recombination must be substantial.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest plausible value is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Without more precise calculation, it's challenging to decide, but considering that interference is often measured in terms of the coefficient of negative interference, a high coefficient would imply a high degree of recombination.\n\nTherefore, I'll lean towards option G (0.5%) as the most reasonable answer, acknowledging that without precise calculations, it's an educated guess.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " The fact that strain B has been primarily affected implies that the lysogenic phage might be causing issues, perhaps recombining with the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being inhibited by another mutation. \n\nThe key here is the number of plasmid duplications observed in the two plates. Each time a phage infects a bacterium, it either integrates its DNA into the phage's genome (duplicates) or it doesn't integrate. If they integrate, it's considered a recombinant phage. The probability of integration depends on the level of selection during phage replication. In this case, the presence of multiple mutants likely leads to varying degrees of integration. However, the question specifically asks about the recombination between the two specific mutations in the T_4 genome. That probably refers to the integration rate of the lysogenic phage variant into the T_4 phage.\n\nIn experiments where different phage types are used together, the frequency of successful integration can indicate the degree of recombination. For example, if only one type successfully integrates, you'd see less duplication. The difference between no integration and full integration would show the recombination percentage. The formula for calculating the recombination coefficient (R) is R = ln(p1/p2), where p1 is the proportion of integrated phages and p2 is the non-integrated ones. Alternatively, sometimes it's calculated as (p1 + p2)/2 - p1, giving the percentage increase over random mixing. However, without exact numbers, it's tricky. \n\nLooking at the data provided: when both mutation types are present, the effect on strain B is partial. Half the cells are treated with 1e7 dilution (so fewer cells, lower chance of phage infection), and the other half with 1e5 (higher chance). The outcomes are 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Since K is strain K, which presumably doesn't have the lysogenic phage mutation (assuming the experiment is done correctly), but wait, the problem states that the two mutations are in the same phage type, T_4. So if both types cause issues, maybe the phages interact. Hmm, this part is confusing. Perhaps the phage is integrating both mutations, leading to increased likelihood of certain events. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the two mutations in the genomic region called rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\" So strain B has the lysogenic phage mutation (maybe the lysogen?), while strain K doesn't. Or vice versa? Maybe the phage has a mutation in rII that causes it to lyse strain B but not K. But the question mentions two types of mutantphages, so perhaps each type has a mutation in rII that affects their ability to replicate or infect. \n\nWhen both types are present, the result was that half the population had half the plumes. That suggests that the combination led to some form of interference. In some cases, the presence of one phage can influence the replication of another. For instance, if the lysogenic phage is integrating into the T_4 phage genome, it could increase the likelihood of the lysogenic phage replicating within the host. This phenomenon is known as phage competition and can lead to the formation of secondary structures like integrase complexes, which increases the probability of further phage infection. This process is sometimes referred to as \"recombination\" between phages, although strictly speaking, it's more about competition rather than integration.\n\nGiven that, the experiment shows that when both mutation types are present, some cells are more susceptible to infection than others. The higher dilution (1e7) likely has fewer cells, so even if the phages are integrated, their chances are lower. Conversely, the lower dilution (1e5) may have more cells, increasing the chance of infection. The fact that 40 plumes appeared on strain B suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B (which caused lysis) was able to infect more cells due to some form of cooperation. The 4 plumes on strain K imply that the lysogenic phage from strain K didn't infect enough cells. This indicates that the lysogenic phage from strain B was more effective, possibly due to integration into the T_4 phage genome.\n\nTo determine the recombination coefficient, we can use the formula R = ln(p1/p2), where p1 is the proportion of cells that showed the lysogenic phenotype (strain B), and p2 is the proportion that didn't. From the data, half the cells were treated with 1e7 dilution (lower chance of infection), and the other half with 1e5 (higher chance). Outcomes: 40 plumes on B, which suggests that the lysogenic phage from B was more common. So p1 = 40/(total), but the total isn't given. Similarly, p2 = (total -40)/(total). Assuming equal numbers in each dilution group, p1 = 0.4 and p2=0.6. Then R = ln(0.4/0.6) \u2248 ln(0.6667) \u2248 -0.4055. Taking absolute value, it's 0.4055, which is approximately 40.55%. Wait, none of the options match this exactly. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, using the Hill coefficient approach, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should consider that the recombination fraction is (p1 + p2)/2 - p1 = (0.4 + 0.6)/2 - 0.4 = 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which is 10%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is (p1 - p2)/p2 *100, which gives (-0.2)/0.6*100 \u2248 -33.33%, which isn't relevant. Maybe the correct approach is to look at the expected number of plasmids and compare it to actual. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations might increase the chance of some form of interaction, leading to the observed distribution.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the concept of \"co-infection,\" where the presence of one phage affects the replication of another. If the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into the T_4 phage, it could increase the efficiency of replication, leading to more infections. This is sometimes referred to as the \"recruitment\" of phages into the T_4 phage's genome. The degree of recruitment would depend on the strength of the interaction between the two phages. If the integration is complete, all cells would be affected; if incomplete, only some would be.\n\nGiven that 40% of the cells (treated with 1e7 dilution) showed the lysogenic phenotype (strain B), and 40% did not (strain K), assuming equal numbers in each group, then p1 = 0.4 and p2 = 0.6. Using the formula R = ln(p1/p2) = ln(0.4/0.6) \u2248 -0.4055. The absolute value is 0.4055, which is roughly 40.55%. None of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options: A. 1%, B. 2%, C. 1.5%, D. 0.1%, E. 0.2%, F. 0.3%, G. 0.5%, H. 5%, I. 0.02%, J. 0.05%, K. 0.02%.\n\nHmm, 40% isn't listed, but the closest option is G. 0.5%, which is 0.5%. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's around 40%, which isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is applied differently. Let me try another approach. The number of plasmids on each well: for the first group, 40 plumes on 100 cells, so 0.4 plasmids per cell. Second group, 40 plumes on 1000 cells, so 0.04 plasmids per cell. The change from 0.4 to 0.04 suggests a significant reduction. The ratio is 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1. So the expected recombination would be log base e of 0.1, which is about -2.3, so 23%. Still not matching the options. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the percentage of recombination relative to the maximum possible. If complete recombination occurs, all cells would show the lysogenic phenotype, so 100%, but that's not our case. In our case, 40% show the lysogenic, meaning 60% don't. The recombination fraction is the decrease from expectation, which would be 40%. But again, no option matches. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: the presence of both mutations leads to some form of interference, reducing the chance of infection compared to random. If the expected number of plasmids without any recombination would be higher, but with recombination, it's lower. The difference between expectations could give the recombination coefficient. Without precise data, it's hard to say, but looking at the options, the closest plausible is 0.5%, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

If the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into the T_4 phage, it could increase the efficiency of replication, leading to more infections. This is sometimes referred to as the \"recruitment\" of phages into the T_4 phage's genome. The degree of recruitment would depend on the strength of the interaction between the two phages. If the integration is complete, all cells would be affected; if incomplete, only some would be.\n\nGiven that 40% of the cells (treated with 1e7 dilution) showed the lysogenic phenotype (strain B), and 40% did not (strain K), assuming equal numbers in each group, then p1 = 0.4 and p2 = 0.6. Using the formula R = ln(p1/p2) = ln(0.4/0.6) \u2248 -0.4055. The absolute value is 0.4055, which is roughly 40.55%. None of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options: A. 1%, B. 2%, C. 1.5%, D. 0.1%, E. 0.2%, F. 0.3%, G. 0.5%, H. 5%, I. 0.02%, J. 0.05%, K. 0.02%.\n\nHmm, 40% isn't listed, but the closest option is G. 0.5%, which is 0.5%. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's around 40%, which isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is applied differently. Let me try another approach. The number of plasmids on each well: for the first group, 40 plumes on 100 cells, so 0.4 plasmids per cell. Second group, 40 plumes on 1000 cells, so 0.04 plasmids per cell. The change from 0.4 to 0.04 suggests a significant reduction. The ratio is 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1. So the expected recombination would be log base e of 0.1, which is about -2.3, so 23%. Still not matching the options. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the percentage of recombination relative to the maximum possible. If complete recombination occurs, all cells would show the lysogenic phenotype, so 100%, but that's not our case. In our case, 40% show the lysogenic, meaning 60% don't. The recombination fraction is the decrease from expectation, which would be 40%. But again, no option matches. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: the presence of both mutations leads to some form of interference, reducing the chance of infection compared to random. If the expected number of plasmids without any recombination would be higher, but with recombination, it's lower. The difference between expectations could give the recombination coefficient. Without precise data, it's hard to say, but looking at the options, the closest plausible is 0.5%, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So the lysogenic phage (the one that lyse) is causing issues, but the lysogenic phage in general doesn't cause lysis. Maybe the presence of another phage affects its ability to replicate or replicate. Or perhaps the phage interactions affect the lysogenic activity. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to cause lysis, while the other phage has a mutation that prevents it from doing so. But in the case where both are present, some of the lysogenic phages still do lyse the cells, leading to the observed effect on strain B. The other half is treated with strain K, and only 4 plumes appear there, whereas 40 on B. Hmm, that seems odd. Normally, if both types are present, you'd expect both strains to be affected, but here strain K only shows 4 plumes. Maybe because the lysogenic phage from the first half didn't work, leaving fewer phages to infect the second half, resulting in fewer plumes. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage from the first half caused enough damage to kill most of the cells, leaving very few phages to infect the second half, thus fewer plumes. \n\nThe key here is figuring out the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the likelihood that the two mutations occur in different phage copies. In phages, especially when using multiple mutants, the recombination rate determines whether the two mutations can coexist within the same phage copy. If recombination occurs, the phage will integrate the two mutations into the same copy; otherwise, they remain separate. The detection of such recombinations often depends on measuring the efficiency of the phage at integrating the mutations into their prophages. \n\nIn the experiment, the initial result was that only strain B was affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage (which should cause lysis) is causing issues. When both types are present, some of the lysogenic phages die, preventing further replication or spreading. This could happen if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that disrupts its ability to replicate without the presence of the lysogenic phage itself. Alternatively, it might interfere with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate. \n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Since the result showed that only strain B was affected initially, implying that the lysogenic phage (with mutation) is disrupting the lysogenic process, but when both are present, the lysogenic phage dies off, meaning that any potential recombination would require the phage to integrate the two mutations. \n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we look at the ratio of recombinant plasmids to wild-type ones. Recombinant plasmids would show up as those that have integrated the two mutations, whereas wild-type would have kept them separate. In the experiment, since only strain B was affected initially, it suggests that the lysogenic phage (mutant) is integrating into the lysogenic pathway, potentially disrupting it. However, when both types are present, the lysogenic phage can't integrate effectively because it's already dead or cannot replicate. Therefore, the level of recombination would depend on how much integration occurred between the two mutations. \n\nIf the recombination was complete (i.e., the two mutations were integrated into a single phage), then all the phages would behave like the wild-type, so neither strain would be affected. Instead, only a fraction would show the affected phenotype, indicating partial recombination. \n\nGiven that the problem states that the lysogenic phage is causing issues, but when both types are present, strain B is mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage is doing its thing despite the presence of another mutation. Perhaps the second mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage's ability to replicate or replicate efficiently. \n\nBut the main point is determining the recombination frequency. If the recombination is high, the phage behaves like a single type, so less or no mutations. If recombination is low, the two mutations are present in different copies, so the effect is visible. \n\nSince the problem mentions that four plumes are found on strain K, which is probably the non-lysed strain, and 40 on B, which is the lysed strain. If strain K had some plumes, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from the first half may have spread to strain K, but the majority of the plumes are on B, which implies that the lysogenic phage didn't reach K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is not spreading beyond a certain point, perhaps due to competition or resistance mechanisms. \n\nHowever, the key is calculating the recombination frequency. The formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals)\n\nBut wait, that's for frequency of recombination events. Alternatively, the probability that two mutations are present in the same phage copy is given by:\n\nP = 1 - e^{-2Nf}\n\nwhere N is the number of phages, and f is the fraction of phages carrying a particular mutation. But in this context, perhaps we're dealing with the fraction of phages that have integrated both mutations. \n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be determined by the number of recombinants versus the total number of possible phages. However, without specific data on N or the distribution of mutations, it's challenging. But in the context of this problem, perhaps we can infer the recombination frequency based on the observed plasmid frequencies. \n\nWhen the first half is treated with strain B, the lysogenic phage (mutant) is causing issues. When both types are present, the lysogenic phage dies off, and only the lysogenic phage from the first half remains, causing issues on strain B. On the other half, treated with strain K, only 4 plumes are found. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from the first half spreads to strain K, but the majority of the phages don't reach there. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage from the first half is not effective against strain K, so it doesn't spread, leaving fewer phages to infect it, hence fewer plumes on K. \n\nBut the main point is that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it ineffective against strain K, leading to fewer plumes. However, the actual recombination frequency is needed to calculate this. \n\nIf the lysogenic phage from the first half has mutated to cause lysis, but the lysogenic phage from the second half (strain K) doesn't respond to its mutation, then the recombination frequency would be low because the lysogenic phage from the first half can't integrate into the lysogenic pathway of strain K. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency (rf) would be low, which corresponds to a small percentage.

Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Because when only the lysogenic phage is present, only strain B is affected. When both are present, perhaps the phages from strain K are somehow combined, leading to increased effect. Alternatively, maybe it's about the combination of mutations resulting in a new pathogen that confers a fitness advantage. But according to the problem statement, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, implying that the lysogenic phage (from strain K) is responsible. \n\nNow, to determine the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the occurrence where two different genetic elements have swapped parts, causing a new combination. Since the phages are from T_4 genome, which contains multiple genes, recombination could lead to a new protein or altered activity. The experiment shows that when both phages are present, the outcome depends on whether they cause individual issues or interact. From the results, since only strain B is affected when only lysogenic phage is present, and when both are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage (from strain K) is combining with another mutation, possibly from strain B itself, leading to a new phenotype. \n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the mutant phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. It says that T_4 phages carrying mutations in rII can cause the lysis of strain B but not of strain K. So both mutations are in rII. The first mutation might cause lysis, while the second mutation may allow replication. Alternatively, perhaps one mutation allows replication, and the other causes lysis. \n\nBut the key point is that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing the issue, as strain B isn't affected. Therefore, the presence of both phages leads to a new mutation in the E. coli's rII region, which is causing the lysis. This indicates that the phages from strain K caused the mutation in strain B. Now, regarding the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, we're looking at how often the two mutations occurred together. \n\nThe number of plasmids per well determines the likelihood of crossing over. For example, in a typical diploid scenario, with four possible gametes, the probability of recombination is 25% (since half the gametes would have the recombinant allele). However, in this case, the results suggest that when both phages are present, the strain B is mostly affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage from strain K is successfully integrating into the host genome, creating a new mutation. But wait, the problem states that the T_4 phages carry mutations in rII, but it's unclear whether these mutations are in the same gene or separate. \n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment, when both phages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing the issue. The presence of both types increases the likelihood of the lysogenic phage from strain K being active, thus contributing to the disruption of strain B. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we consider the number of gametes formed. Each phage has two copies of the T_4 genome, so during recombination, there are four possible gamete combinations. However, the recombination frequency is typically expressed as the percentage of gametes that are recombinant. For a typical case without interference, recombination frequency is around 25%. But in this case, the data suggests a different approach. \n\nLooking at the results: When both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected (40 plumes), whereas strain K is less affected (4 plumes). This suggests that the presence of both phages increases the risk of E. coli strain B being affected. If the lysogenic phage from strain K integrates into the T_4 genome, it could create a new mutation in strain B's rII region. If this integration happened frequently, the E. coli strain B would be more likely to have the mutation. \n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, if the two mutations occurred in the same T_4 gene, the expected recombinant gametes would be 25%, but here, the presence of both mutants affects the strain B's growth, indicating that the mutation in strain K is spreading or causing a change in the host's response. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutations are in different regions but are linked in the T_4 genome. \n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If the two mutations are in the same gene, the recombination frequency would indicate how often they occur. But given the results, it seems like the mutation in strain K is being integrated into the T_4 genome, which might affect the host's ability to replicate or lyse the E. coli. \n\nGiven the options provided, the most straightforward calculation for recombination frequency is that when both mutations are present, the recombination occurs 50% of the time, but the options don't include 50%. Instead, the closest option is G (0.5%) or H (5%). However, recombination frequencies in genetics are usually measured in percentages or fractions. If we consider the ratio of recombinant to total gametes, it might be 25% (for independent assortment), but in this case, the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of the mutation in strain B, suggesting that the recombination is happening. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If both mutations are present in the same T_4 gene, then the recombination frequency would depend on how often they interleave. However, if the mutations are in separate genes, the recombination frequency would be lower. Given the context, the two mutations are in the same T_4 gene. \n\nAssuming that the two mutations are in the same T_4 gene, the expected recombination frequency would be approximately 25%, but since the options don't have 25%, the closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). However, in reality, when two mutations are present, the recombination frequency is 50% because each gamete has a 50% chance of recombining. But I'm not sure if this applies here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of the mutation occurring in the host, so the recombination frequency is high. \n\nAnother angle: the experiment measures the distribution of the plasmids. When both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing the disruption. This suggests that the two mutations are in the same T_4 gene and that recombination is occurring. The recombination frequency in such cases is typically around 25%, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is C (1.5%) or D (0.1%). Alternatively, if the experiment shows that the presence of both mutations leads to a 50% increase in the rate of lysogenic fission, the recombination frequency would be 50%, but again, the options don't reflect that. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to look at the number of plasmids. When both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage from strain K is more effective. This could imply that the two mutations are in the same T_4 gene, and the recombination frequency is high. However, without further information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact value. Among the options, 0.5% (G) is close to 25% but scaled down, and 0.1% (D) is even smaller. Considering that the experiment shows significant effects, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 5%, making option G (0.5%) the closest. Alternatively, if the experiment shows that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of the lysogenic phage from strain K integrating into the T_4 genome, the recombination frequency would be higher, but the options don't go beyond 5%.\n\nI think I'm getting confused. Let me try to simplify. The problem states that when both mutations are present, E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain K is causing the issue. If these mutations are in the same T_4 gene, the recombination frequency would determine how often they interfere. Without specific recombination data, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. The highest plausible value among the options is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%), but I'm unsure.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe key here is recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different phage genes, leading to a new mutation. In this case, the two mutations might have recombined, resulting in a new plasmid that integrates into the host's T4 genome. This integration could affect whether the phage can infect the bacteria. For example, if the new phage has a different lysogenic life cycle, it might cause different outcomes\u2014like lysing cells or inducing lytic fission. \n\nIn the experiment, when both mutants are present, the effect is similar to having one mutation, as seen in the division where the half with the lysogenic phage was most affected. But why? Maybe the presence of the other type of phage isn't enough to change much, indicating no significant recombination. Alternatively, perhaps only one of the mutations affects the outcome significantly, while the other doesn't contribute much. \n\nLooking at the data: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. The ratio is 1:10, suggesting that the chance of a phage infecting a cell is roughly equal for both plating methods. Wait, no\u2014the dilutions are 1e5 and 1e7. That means the number of cells plated is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So a higher dilution factor means fewer cells, thus lower probability of each phage infecting a cell. Conversely, a lower dilution factor means more cells, increasing the chance of more infections. \n\nIf the recombination leads to a new mutation, then the presence of either mutation should increase the likelihood of infection, regardless of the plating method. However, in the experiment, neither mutation alone caused the same level of infection as their combination. Since the lysogenic phage caused all the divisions, and the other half didn't show any effect, it suggests that the recombination didn't occur. Because if recombination happened, the other mutation would still contribute to the same outcome, making the lysogenic phage's effect more pronounced. \n\nWait, but in reality, sometimes even with recombination, the presence of one mutation may dominate, especially if one is dominant. Alternatively, without recombination, both mutations act independently, leading to some interference or competition in the infection process. \n\nAnother angle is the number of plumes detected. On the K plate, there are fewer plumes than on B, meaning fewer infections occurred on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage had a greater effect on K than on B. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage should have acted similarly across all strains, leading to comparable levels of infection. Instead, the effect on K was less severe, implying that the lysogenic phage did not fully integrate with the T4 genome, perhaps due to incomplete recombination. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nBut wait, in this context, the recombination is observed through the difference in plating efficiency between the two groups. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage resulted in a higher proportion of successful infections compared to the other group. However, since both mutations contributed to the same outcome, the relative effect depends on their interaction. \n\nAlternatively, considering the log odds ratio approach, which estimates the strength of association between two events. The formula is:\n\nlog(Odds) = ln(P(A|B)/P(A|not B)) - ln(P(A|C)/P(A|not C)))\n\nWhere A is the event of successful infection, B and C represent the two groups.\n\nIn our case:\n- Group B (lysogenic): 40 plumes\n- Group K: 4 plumes\n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes without recombination would be around the average of the two groups, but since both mutations interfere, perhaps the actual recombination is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to look at the ratio of plumes. Since the lysogenic phage caused more divisions, its effect was stronger. The ratio of plumes is 4 vs. 40, which is a 10x difference. This suggests that the lysogenic phage caused ten times as many successful infections as the other group. If recombination occurred, the effects would overlap; however, in this case, the lysogenic phage's effect was stronger, suggesting that recombination was minimal or non-existent. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is low. Looking at the options, the lowest is 0.02% (option I), but typically, such calculations give frequencies like 0.05%. However, considering the data, perhaps it's closer to 0.02%. \n\nWait, another thought: The ratio of plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage had a 10x higher chance of causing a division. The expected number without recombination would be somewhere in between, but given the results, it seems that the lysogenic phage overtook the other group. Therefore, the recombination must be very low, possibly near zero, which corresponds to option I (0.02%) or F (0.3%). Given the precise calculation, perhaps it's 0.05%, which matches option J. Alternatively, using the chi-square test for goodness of fit, the expected number under independence would be (4 + 40) * (4/84) \u2248 1.9, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try again. Without recombination, the distribution of plumes would follow the proportions of the groups. The total plumes are 4 + 40 = 44. The expected plumes from lysogenic would be (4/44)*40 \u2248 3.64, and from the other group, (40/44)*4 \u2248 3.64. However, the observed lysogenic plumes are 4, which is slightly above the expectation. Similarly, the other group has 3.64, which is below the expectation. The chi-square statistic would be (O-E)^2/E summed over categories. Calculating:\n\nFor lysogenic: (4 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 (0.36)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 0.13 / 3.64 \u2248 0.0356\nFor other group: (3.64 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 = 0\nTotal \u03c7\u00b2 \u2248 0.0356\n\nDegrees of freedom is 1.

Instead, the effect on K was less severe, implying that the lysogenic phage did not fully integrate with the T4 genome, perhaps due to incomplete recombination. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nBut wait, in this context, the recombination is observed through the difference in plating efficiency between the two groups. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage resulted in a higher proportion of successful infections compared to the other group. However, since both mutations contributed to the same outcome, the relative effect depends on their interaction. \n\nAlternatively, considering the log odds ratio approach, which estimates the strength of association between two events. The formula is:\n\nlog(Odds) = ln(P(A|B)/P(A|not B)) - ln(P(A|C)/P(A|not C)))\n\nWhere A is the event of successful infection, B and C represent the two groups.\n\nIn our case:\n- Group B (lysogenic): 40 plumes\n- Group K: 4 plumes\n\nAssuming that the expected number of plumes without recombination would be around the average of the two groups, but since both mutations interfere, perhaps the actual recombination is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to look at the ratio of plumes. Since the lysogenic phage caused more divisions, its effect was stronger. The ratio of plumes is 4 vs. 40, which is a 10x difference. This suggests that the lysogenic phage caused ten times as many successful infections as the other group. If recombination occurred, the effects would overlap; however, in this case, the lysogenic phage's effect was stronger, suggesting that recombination was minimal or non-existent. \n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is low. Looking at the options, the lowest is 0.02% (option I), but typically, such calculations give frequencies like 0.05%. However, considering the data, perhaps it's closer to 0.02%. \n\nWait, another thought: The ratio of plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage had a 10x higher chance of causing a division. The expected number without recombination would be somewhere in between, but given the results, it seems that the lysogenic phage overtook the other group. Therefore, the recombination must be very low, possibly near zero, which corresponds to option I (0.02%) or F (0.3%). Given the precise calculation, perhaps it's 0.05%, which matches option J. Alternatively, using the chi-square test for goodness of fit, the expected number under independence would be (4 + 40) * (4/84) \u2248 1.9, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try again. Without recombination, the distribution of plumes would follow the proportions of the groups. The total plumes are 4 + 40 = 44. The expected plumes from lysogenic would be (4/44)*40 \u2248 3.64, and from the other group, (40/44)*4 \u2248 3.64. However, the observed lysogenic plumes are 4, which is slightly above the expectation. Similarly, the other group has 3.64, which is below the expectation. The chi-square statistic would be (O-E)^2/E summed over categories. Calculating:\n\nFor lysogenic: (4 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 (0.36)^2 / 3.64 \u2248 0.13 / 3.64 \u2248 0.0356\nFor other group: (3.64 - 3.64)^2 / 3.64 = 0\nTotal \u03c7\u00b2 \u2248 0.0356\n\nDegrees of freedom is 1. At \u03b1=0.05, critical value is 3.84. Since 0.0356 </think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The outcome is that some bacteria die (lysed), others don't.",
    "rollout": " The outcome is that some bacteria die (lysed), others don't. The fact that strain B has four plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage caused more issues than the lytic one. Strain K had 40 plumes, which is much higher. Hmm. Now, how do these numbers relate to recombination? Recombination would imply that the two mutations interact, creating a new variant that might cause different effects. In phages, recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages, leading to new variants. If two mutants combine, sometimes they form a heterozygous phage, which might have a different fitness effect. However, in this case, the issue was with the lysogenic phage causing more problems. Maybe the presence of both mutants increases their potential activity or efficiency in causing lytic fission. Alternatively, perhaps recombination leads to increased expression of certain genes that make the phage more active, like lysogeny. Wait, but the problem states that only the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission, which is death. So the lysogenic phage should be dying, but in reality, it's killing the E. coli, meaning it's becoming active again. That makes sense because lysogenic phages require an integrase to insert their gene into the host's DNA, allowing them to replicate without being lysed. Once they become active, they can lyse the cells. So the lysogenic phage (mutant) becomes active. The lytic phage (mutant) dies. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage becomes active, killing more cells, while the lytic phage dies. Now, looking at the experimental results: strain B is mostly killed by both types, but since the lysogenic phage kills more, the overall effect is that strain B is mainly killed by the lysogenic phage, whereas strain K is killed less. Wait, no. Because strain B is primarily killed by the lysogenic phage, as only the lysogenic phage leads to death. So when both types are present, all the lysogenic phages die, but the lytic ones remain. Therefore, the lysogenic phages kill the E. coli, while the lytic ones don't. So when both are present, the lysogenic phages are the ones that kill the E. coli, leading to more deaths. Now, the experiment involved diluting the phages differently. The first sample was diluted 1:1e7, meaning fewer cells are plated, so the chance of each phage infecting a cell is lower. The second sample was 1:1e5, so more cells are plated, increasing the probability of more infections. However, the observed number of plumes depends on the dilution factor and the actual fitness of the phages. Since the lysogenic phage (mutant) becomes active, it's more likely to infect, hence more plumes. The lytic phage (mutant) doesn't survive, so it doesn't contribute to plumes. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage dominates, causing more plumes. The other scenario is when only one type is present, so the lytic phage is dominant, and few plumes occur. Now, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination here probably refers to the interaction between the two mutants, possibly creating a new phage variant that affects the outcome. In phages, recombination often refers to the exchange of genetic elements, such as integrases, between phages, leading to new combinations. This could affect the fitness of the phage, either increasing or decreasing its ability to infect. For example, if two mutants exchange parts of their genomes, they might produce a new phage that has a different fitness. In this context, the recombination rate determines whether the two mutants work together or against each other. If they recombine, the resulting phage might have a higher chance of infecting, leading to more plumes. If they don't recombine, each mutation acts independently. Now, the experiment shows that when both mutants are present, more plumes are seen on strain B compared to strain K. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because strain B is more affected by both types. Actually, since strain B is primarily killed by the lysogenic phage, and strain K is killed less, this suggests that the lysogenic phage is causing more damage. So the recombination must play a role in determining which mutation takes over. Alternatively, the recombination rate affects the relative fitness of the two mutants. Let me consider the possible outcomes. If the two mutants recombine, the resulting phage might have a higher fitness advantage, meaning it's more likely to infect and cause more plumes. If they don't recombine, each mutation operates independently, and the likelihood of plumes depends on each mutation's own success rates. The observed difference in plumes (more on B) could indicate that the lysogenic phage is more successful when combined with the other mutant. So the recombination rate determines which mutation is dominant in terms of plume production. To quantify this, we can use the formula related to the probability of combination. The expected number of recombinants (plumes) would depend on the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. However, in this case, the experiment shows that the presence of both mutants leads to more plumes on strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is dominant. Alternatively, the presence of both mutants allows for some degree of combination, which may increase the fitness of the phage. The exact calculation would involve knowing the probabilities of each mutation and how they combine. Without specific data on the recombination rates, perhaps we can estimate the percentage of time the two mutations recombine versus not recombining. Let's assume that the recombination frequency (rf) is low, indicating minimal interaction. The rf relates to the probability of recombination occurring during replication. A common approximation is that rf \u2248 1 - e^{-2p}, where p is the probability of recombination per replication. If the rf is very low, then p is also very low. Let's say that the rf is around 1%, which corresponds to p \u2248 0.01. Then, the expected number of recombinants would be lower than if there were no recombination. However, given the experimental results, more plumes suggest that recombination occurred. The observed plume counts are 4 on K and 40 on B. The total number of plumes across both samples is 4 + 40 = 44. Assuming equal dilution factors, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 4/40 = 0.1, which is 10%. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation (lytic phage) increases the likelihood of another mutation (lysogenic) occurring, leading to more plumes on B. If the recombination rate is high enough to make the lysogenic phage more effective, this would explain why strain B has more plumes despite having both mutants. Conversely, if the recombination rate is low, the lysogenic phage would be more likely to dominate, leading to fewer plumes on B. The observed ratio of 1:10 suggests that the lysogenic phage's presence increased the chance of another mutation occurring, but the exact relationship requires calculating the recombination rate. Using the formula for the probability of recombination, P = 1 - e^{-2p}. Given that the ratio of plumes is 1:10, we can infer that the probability of the lysogenic phage being selected is higher, implying a higher recombination rate. Solving for p when P = 0.1 (since 1/10 = 0.1), we get P = 1 - e^{-2p} => e^{-2p} = 0.9 => ln(0.9) = -2p => p \u2248 0.523 (ln(0.9)/(-2)). Converting this to rf using rf \u2248 1 - e^{-2p} \u2248 1 - e^{-1.046} \u2248 1 - 0.35 \u2248 0.65 or 65%. Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's try a different approach. The key is to determine the recombination frequency (rf) between the two mutants. The observed outcome depends on how often the two mutations combine. If the rf is low, the chance of combining is low, so the lysogenic phage remains dominant, leading to fewer plumes on B. If rf is high, more combinations occur, leading to more plumes. Given the results, strain B has more plumes, so the lysogenic phage must be more likely to cause issues. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effectively combined with another mutation, leading to higher failure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the other mutation enhances the lysogenic phage's activity. Anyway, the question is asking for the recombination amount between the two mutations. From the options provided, the highest recombination is 0.5% (option G), followed by 0.3% (F), etc., down to 0.02% (I). The calculated rf above came out to approximately 65%, which isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results. Let me reconsider. The experiment involves two groups: one with both mutations and one with only one mutation. The larger group (diluted 1:1e5) is placed on strain B, and the smaller group (1:1e7) is placed on strain K. On strain B, there are 4 plumes, which are from the lysogenic phage. On strain K, there are 40 plumes, mostly from the lytic phage. Since the lysogenic phage is more problematic, the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to more plumes on B, even though both are present. This implies that the lysogenic phage is becoming active and killing more cells. The lytic phage is still present but doesn't kill as many cells. So the recombination must be significant enough to allow the lysogenic phage to take over. However, without knowing the exact recombination rate, it's challenging to pinpoint the percentage. Another angle is to consider that the presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of recombination, making the lysogenic phage more effective. If recombination occurs frequently, the lysogenic phage gains an advantage. To reach 40 plumes on K, which is significantly higher than the 4 on B, the recombination must be quite frequent. But the answer choices go up to 0.5%, which is 0.5 percent. However, earlier calculations suggested a much higher recombination rate. Perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me try using the formula for the probability of recombination in a population. The expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. Suppose the frequency of the lysogenic phage is fL and the frequency of the lytic phage is fP. The recombination frequency RF is the probability that a random pair of phages recombines. The expected number of recombinant plumes would be fL * fP * N, where N is the number of cells plated. Comparing the two samples, the ratio of plumes is 4/40 = 0.1. Assuming the same N, this ratio equals fL * fP. If the two mutations are independent, fL * fP = 0.1. However, if they recombine frequently, fL * fP increases. Let's assume that the recombination rate RF is the measure. RF is related to fL and fP through the equation RF = 1 - e^{-2fL * fP}. We can solve for RF when fL * fP = 0.1. Plugging in, RF = 1 - e^{-0.2} \u2248 1 - 0.8187 \u2248 0.1813, or 18.13%. That's way too high, as the options only go up to 0.5%. Alternatively, if RF is directly related to the observed ratio, perhaps RF is 0.5%, corresponding to a 1% recombination frequency. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The correct formula for the probability of recombination is RF = 1 - e^{-2fL fP}. If fL and fP are small, RF \u2248 2fL fP. Here, fL * fP = 0.1. So RF \u2248 2 * 0.1 = 0.2, or 20%. Again, that's not matching any option. Maybe the correct approach is to consider that the presence of both mutations leads to more recombination, but the exact value isn't clear. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a rough estimation based on the observed plume distribution. The fact that strain B has 40 plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective when paired with the other mutation. If the recombination rate is around 0.5%, then RF \u2248 0.5%, and fL * fP \u2248 0.5%, which matches the observed ratio of 40 plumes. Therefore, the recombination amount is approximately 0.5%, which is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Recombination refers to the proportion of times two loci produce recombinant alleles together. In phages, especially T_4, which use a transposase enzyme, recombination would occur if the phage's integration site is adjacent to the mutation site. Since T_4 phages typically use transposase, any new mutation introduced by a phage would potentially disrupt the host chromosome through integration. However, in this case, the problem states that the two mutantphages carry mutations in the same region (rII), implying that their integrations might be overlapping or near each other. \n\nLooking at the results: the lysogenic phage doesn't cause the same issue as the wild-type. That suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing a disruption in the host DNA that isn't present in the wild-type mutation. This could happen if the lysogenic phage's mutation causes integration without disrupting the original site, whereas the wild-type mutation does cause some disruption. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might have a mutation that allows it to replicate without integrating efficiently, thus surviving and infecting more cells. \n\nBut wait, in the experiment, the presence of both mutants leads to a specific outcome.

That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Perhaps the experiment is designed such that the effect depends on whether the phage integrates or not. If the lysogenic phage integrates successfully, it might replicate and lyse the bacteria, while the wild-type phage would replicate without integrating, thus not causing the same effect. \n\nSo, the number of plumes on K (strain B) being much higher than on K (strain K) suggests that the lysogenic phage's mutation is causing issues, hence the higher count on K. The other half, which is the lysogenic phage, shows a higher number of plumes, suggesting it's being replicated or integrating effectively. Therefore, the recombination frequency must relate to the likelihood of the lysogenic phage integrating into the host's chromosome. \n\nIn the context of T_4 phages, if the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to integrate without disrupting the original site (which is rare unless the mutation is very close to the transposase site), then the recombination frequency would be low. Conversely, if the mutation causes disruption, the recombination frequency would be high. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage isn't causing the same issue, it implies that its mutation likely disrupts the host's chromosome. If the lysogenic phage's mutation occurs near the transposase site, it won't integrate (low recombination frequency). If the mutation is far enough from the transposase site, it might integrate (high recombination frequency). \n\nIn the experiment, the presence of multiple plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating or integrating. If the lysogenic phage's mutation doesn't interfere with transposase activity, the integration would be inefficient, resulting in fewer plumes (since fewer phages infect the bacteria). Conversely, if the mutation does interfere, the integration would be more efficient, leading to more plumes. \n\nWait, but in our case, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause the same problem as the wild type. So perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation is the cause, meaning its integration is disrupted.

During the replication of phages, especially T_4, which has a specific lysis cycle, the two mutations might either be lost together or recombined. \n\nThe problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This could indicate that at least one type of phage is dominant enough to cause issues without much recombination. However, sometimes even when one mutation exists, another mutation may be lost due to recombination. In this case, four plumes appear on strain K. Since K is supposed to be E. coli strain B, if four plumes appeared on K, perhaps some of the lysogenic phage was lost through recombination. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage wasn't effective because it recombined with the lysogenic phage itself, causing its loss from the phage population. \n\nBut wait, no, lysogenic phages don't replicate their DNA; they integrate it into the host genome. If the lysogenic phage recombines with another lysogenic phage, then it would lose its DNA and die. Similarly, the lytic phage integrates its DNA into the lysogenic phage, causing it to die upon lysis. So if both mutation types are present, recombination would occur, potentially eliminating one type. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is still active, as the lysogenic phage isn't killed by the lysogenic phage. But why did strain K have only 4 plumes? Strain K is E. coli strain B, same as strain B. Wait, no\u2014the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" But strain K is probably the same as strain B, unless it's a typo. Wait, looking back: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Oh, right, so one half is used for strain B, and the other for strain K, which is presumably a different strain or possibly the same. Hmm, but the experiment mentions two types of mutantphage, implying both types are present in each half. Wait, no\u2014each half contains both mutantphages because they're being plated separately. Or perhaps each half has only one type, but that seems unlikely given the setup. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nLet me try again. Each half has both types of phage mutants. So in each well, you have both types present. Then you plate them on strain B's lawn. The lysogenic phage should survive because it's not integrating its DNA into the lysogenic phage. The lytic phage should die upon lysis. So why are there four plumes on strain K (which is strain B)? Maybe some of the lysogenic phages died due to recombination with themselves. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phages weren't fully functional because they couldn't integrate their DNA properly, leading to loss of function. \n\nBut wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages within the same genome, typically during the phage's replication. If the two phages recombine, then one could lose its ability to infect, while the other continues to do so. \n\nLooking at the data: when both types are present, strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that at least one of the types is still present and functional. If recombination occurred, one type might have lost its function. For example, suppose the lysogenic phage (type 1) recombines with another lysogenic phage (type 2), causing type 1 to lose its DNA and die. Thus, strain B would only be affected by type 2, but not type 1. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage recombines with itself, it dies. \n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain K (strain B) is 40, and on strain K's own lawn, it's 4. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. No, strain K is strain B, so all experiments are on strain B. Wait, the problem says: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So both halves are on strain B's lawn. Wait, no, each half is either on strain B or on strain K. So one half has both mutant phages on strain B's lawn, producing 40 plumes. The other half has both mutant phages on strain K's lawn, which is E. coli strain K. But the problem statement says \"four plaques are found on K and 40 on B.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense because both halves are on strain B's lawn. Unless it's a typo, and it should say \"on strain K's lawn\" twice. Perhaps that's a mistake in the user's original question.\n\nAssuming that each half is on strain B's lawn, and the count is 40 on B and 40 on K (but according to the user, it's 4 on K and 40 on B). That seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that one half is on strain B's lawn and gets 40 plumes, and the other half is on strain K's lawn and gets 4 plumes. That makes more sense. So, half the culture is on strain B's lawn with 40 plumes, and the other half is on strain K's lawn with 4 plumes. Now, when only one type of phage is present, only the second type is susceptible. So the presence of 4 plumes on strain K (strain B) indicates that the lysogenic phage is still present, while the 40 plumes on strain K (same as strain B) suggest that the lysogenic phage is not present, meaning the lysogenic phage must have been lost. \n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If strain B is mostly affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is still functional. But if the lysogenic phage recombines with itself, it loses function. So when both mutant types are present, recombination occurs, losing the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to infect strain B anymore. But the experiment shows that strain B has 40 plumes (so the lysogenic phage is present), and strain K (strain B) has 4 plumes (lysogenic phage is gone). But according to the user, the counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems inconsistent because both halves are on strain B's lawn. So maybe the user made a mistake in the counts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps one half is on strain B's lawn and gets 40 plumes (lysogenic phage remains), and the other half is on strain K's lawn and gets 4 plumes (lyso-phage lost). So total plumes on strain B's lawn: 40 + 4 = 44? But the user said 40 on K and 40 on B. Maybe the counts are correct as 40 on B and 4 on K. That would imply that strain B is mostly unaffected (40 plumes) and strain K (strain B) is affected (4 plumes). But that doesn't fit with the idea that recombination removes lysogenic phage. So perhaps the user intended to have both halves on strain B's lawn, but counted differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the counts are 4 on K and 40 on B, indicating that strain K is affected (4 plumes) and strain B is not (40 plumes). But that contradicts the idea that recombination removes lysogenic phage. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are correct, and I need to interpret them differently. \n\nIf both halves are on strain B's lawn, then the counts would reflect whether the lysogenic phage is present or lost. If strain B is mostly affected, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is still present, which contradicts recombination. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to mix the samples differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking about the probability of recombination, considering the observed plume counts.\n\nSo, the observed outcome is that when both mutation types are present, strain B is mostly affected (40 plumes) and strain K (strain B) is affected (4 plumes). This suggests that the lysogenic phage was lost, meaning that recombination occurred. Therefore, we need to calculate the frequency of recombination based on the observed numbers.\n\nEach mutation is likely to occur independently, but recombination reduces the likelihood of independent events. The expected number of recombinant plumes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinant plumes = (number of lysogenic phages) * (probability of recombination)\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact approach here. Alternatively, the probability of recombination (p) affects the distribution of plumes. The number of plumes depends on the degree of recombination. If there's complete recombination, all plumes come from recombined phages, but if there's no recombination, the plumes come from either lysogenic or wild-type. \n\nGiven that strain B is mostly affected, it suggests that recombination happened, as the lysogenic phage was lost. To determine the percentage of recombination, we can use the observed plume counts. The ratio of plumes on strain K compared to strain B gives us an idea of the recombination fraction. \n\nWait, perhaps I should model this. Let\u2019s denote p as the proportion of phages that recombine. If p=0, no recombination, and if p=1, all recombine. \n\nWhen both types are present, the possible outcomes are:\n- Lysogenic phage (type 1) survives.\n- Recombination occurs, so lysogenic phage (type 1) becomes part of the recombined phage population.\n- Wild-type phage (type 2) also survives.\n\nHowever, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage is replaced by the recombined phage. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how recombination works. If a lysogenic phage recombines with a wild-type phage, the wild-type replaces the lysogenic in the phage population. Therefore, the lysogenic phage cannot infect the host anymore, leaving only wild-type phages. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage recombines with another lysogenic phage, it loses its DNA and dies. \n\nTherefore, in the presence of both types:\n- If recombination occurs between type 1 and type 1, type 1 dies.\n- If recombination occurs between type 1 and type 2, type 1 and type 2 coexist.\n- If recombination occurs between type 2 and type 2, type 2 dies.\n\nThus, the surviving phage population consists of either type 1 alone, type 2 alone, or a mixture depending on recombination rates. \n\nNow, in the experiment:\n- Strain B is mostly affected, suggesting type 1 is no longer present.\n- Strain K (strain B) has only 4 plumes, suggesting type 1 is lost.\n\nThis implies that recombination occurred, as the lysogenic phage (type 1) was removed from the population. \n\nTo quantify recombination, we can consider the ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B. If there was no recombination, we'd expect equal plumes on both strains. However, since strain K is affected and strain B is not, this suggests some loss of type 1. \n\nPerhaps the ratio of plumes can help estimate the recombination rate. Alternatively, considering the number of phages, but I'm getting stuck here. \n\nMaybe a simpler approach is to assume that the number of plumes corresponds to the fraction of phages that successfully infect the host. When both types are present, the expected number of plumes would depend on the combination of recombination and selection pressures. \n\nGiven that the experiment resulted in 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K, we can infer that recombination occurred significantly. To find the recombination rate, we can set up an equation where the product of the probabilities equals the observed ratio. \n\nAlternatively, considering that when both types are present, the lysogenic phage is lost, and the remaining phages are wild-type. Therefore, the number of wild-type phages should correspond to the number of plumes on strain K. If strain K had 4 plumes, and strain B had 40, it suggests that the lysogenic phage was lost, and the remaining phages are wild-type. \n\nThe fraction of wild-type phages is 4/(4+40) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. \n\nSimilarly, if recombination occurs frequently, the fraction of wild-type phages increases. Therefore, the recombination rate can be estimated based on how much the wild-type fraction changes. \n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequency of wild-type phages (q) can be expressed as q = sqrt(p), where p is the fraction of recombinants. But I'm not entirely sure if that applies here. \n\nAlternatively, the fraction of wild-type phages (W) and lysogenic phages (L) can be modeled as W = (p^2)/(p^2 + 2pq + q^2) and L = (q^2)/(p^2 + 2pq + q^2), but this might complicate things. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's best to recall that the most common answer for such problems is around 5% or so, corresponding to option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). But I'm not certain. Another approach is to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed plume counts. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage is lost, the recombination must have occurred sufficiently often. Assuming that without recombination, all plumes would be equally distributed on both strains. With recombination, the fraction of plumes on strain K decreases. \n\nThe ratio of plumes on strain K to strain B is 4/40 = 0.1. If recombination occurs with a probability r, then the fraction of wild-type phages (W) would be related to r. \n\nAssuming that when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage is lost, and the remaining phages are wild-type. Therefore, the fraction of wild-type phages is (1 - r). \n\nIf we assume that when recombination occurs, the fraction of wild-type phages increases, then the ratio of plumes on strain K (W) to strain B (L) would decrease. \n\nBut without a clear mathematical model, it's challenging to compute exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The key here is recombination, which refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phages. During the replication of phages, especially T_4, which has a specific lysis cycle, the two mutations might either be lost together or recombined. \n\nThe problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This could indicate that at least one type of phage is dominant enough to cause issues without much recombination. However, sometimes even when one mutation exists, another mutation may be lost due to recombination. In this case, four plumes appear on strain K. Since K is supposed to be E. coli strain B, if four plumes appeared on K, perhaps some of the lysogenic phage was lost through recombination. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage wasn't effective because it recombined with the lysogenic phage itself, causing its loss from the phage population. \n\nBut wait, no, lysogenic phages don't replicate their DNA; they integrate it into the host genome. If the lysogenic phage recombines with another lysogenic phage, then it would lose its DNA and die. Similarly, the lytic phage integrates its DNA into the lysogenic phage, causing it to die upon lysis. So if both mutation types are present, recombination would occur, potentially eliminating one type. \n\nIn the experiment, when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is still active, as the lysogenic phage isn't killed by the lysogenic phage. But why did strain K have only 4 plumes? Strain K is E. coli strain B, same as strain B. Wait, no\u2014the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" But strain K is probably the same as strain B, unless it's a typo. Wait, looking back: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Oh, right, so one half is used for strain B, and the other for strain K, which is presumably a different strain or possibly the same. Hmm, but the experiment mentions two types of mutantphage, implying both types are present in each half. Wait, no\u2014each half contains both mutantphages because they're being plated separately. Or perhaps each half has only one type, but that seems unlikely given the setup. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nLet me try again. Each half has both types of phage mutants. So in each well, you have both types present. Then you plate them on strain B's lawn. The lysogenic phage should survive because it's not integrating its DNA into the lysogenic phage. The lytic phage should die upon lysis. So why are there four plumes on strain K (which is strain B)? Maybe some of the lysogenic phages died due to recombination with themselves. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phages weren't fully functional because they couldn't integrate their DNA properly, leading to loss of function. \n\nBut wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages within the same genome, typically during the phage's replication. If the two phages recombine, then one could lose its ability to infect, while the other continues to do so. \n\nLooking at the data: when both types are present, strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that at least one of the types is still present and functional. If recombination occurred, one type might have lost its function. For example, suppose the lysogenic phage (type 1) recombines with another lysogenic phage (type 2), causing type 1 to lose its DNA and die. Thus, strain B would only be affected by type 2, but not type 1. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage recombines with itself, it dies. \n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain K (strain B) is 40, and on strain K's own lawn, it's 4. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. No, strain K is strain B, so all experiments are on strain B. Wait, the problem says: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So both halves are on strain B's lawn. Wait, no, each half is either on strain B or on strain K. So one half has both mutant phages on strain B's lawn, producing 40 plumes. The other half has both mutant phages on strain K's lawn, which is E. coli strain K. But the problem statement says \"four plaques are found on K and 40 on B.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense because both halves are on strain B's lawn. Unless it's a typo, and it should say \"on strain K's lawn\" twice. Perhaps that's a mistake in the user's original question.\n\nAssuming that each half is on strain B's lawn, and the count is 40 on B and 40 on K (but according to the user, it's 4 on K and 40 on B). That seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that one half is on strain B's lawn and gets 40 plumes, and the other half is on strain K's lawn and gets 4 plumes. That makes more sense. So, half the culture is on strain B's lawn with 40 plumes, and the other half is on strain K's lawn with 4 plumes. Now, when only one type of phage is present, only the second type is susceptible. So the presence of 4 plumes on strain K (strain B) indicates that the lysogenic phage is still present, while the 40 plumes on strain K (same as strain B) suggest that the lysogenic phage is not present, meaning the lysogenic phage must have been lost. \n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If strain B is mostly affected, it implies that the lysogenic phage is still functional. But if the lysogenic phage recombines with itself, it loses function. So when both mutant types are present, recombination occurs, losing the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to infect strain B anymore. But the experiment shows that strain B has 40 plumes (so the lysogenic phage is present), and strain K (strain B) has 4 plumes (lysogenic phage is gone). But according to the user, the counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems inconsistent because both halves are on strain B's lawn. So maybe the user made a mistake in the counts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps one half is on strain B's lawn and gets 40 plumes (lysogenic phage remains), and the other half is on strain K's lawn and gets 4 plumes (lyso-phage lost). So total plumes on strain B's lawn: 40 + 4 = 44? But the user said 40 on K and 40 on B. Maybe the counts are correct as 40 on B and 4 on K. That would imply that strain B is mostly unaffected (40 plumes) and strain K (strain B) is affected (4 plumes). But that doesn't fit with the idea that recombination removes lysogenic phage. So perhaps the user intended to have both halves on strain B's lawn, but counted differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the counts are 4 on K and 40 on B, indicating that strain K is affected (4 plumes) and strain B is not (40 plumes). But that contradicts the idea that recombination removes lysogenic phage. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are correct, and I need to interpret them differently. \n\nIf both halves are on strain B's lawn, then the counts would reflect whether the lysogenic phage is present or lost. If strain B is mostly affected, that suggests that the lysogenic phage is still present, which contradicts recombination. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to mix the samples differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking about the probability of recombination, considering the observed plume counts.\n\nSo, the observed outcome is that when both mutation types are present, strain B is mostly affected (40 plumes) and strain K (strain B) is affected (4 plumes).

However, the results showed that half the culture (on strain B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and the other half (on strain K's lawn) had 4 plumes. Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So the first half (diluted 1e7) is on strain B, giving 40 plumes, and the second half (diluted 1e5) is on strain K, giving 4 plumes. \n\nWait, no, the user wrote: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Hmm, no, the user said: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.

The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" Wait, no, that seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal text:\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\nThe other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\nFour plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo, half of the total population (if the original was split into two equal parts) is dilute 1e7 and plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is dilute 1e5 and plated on strain K, resulting in 4 plumes. Wait, but the initial division probably has two groups: one group is the same as the original, and another group is a different fraction. Maybe it's a standard split where one group is larger (diluted 1e7), and the other is smaller (diluted 1e5), leading to more plumes in the larger sample. Because dilution affects the number of cells plated; higher dilution means fewer cells, lower dilution means more cells. So if you plate more cells, you get more chances for infection. \n\nIn the first case, the larger sample (diluted 1e7) shows 40 plumes, meaning more infections than expected at that dilution. The smaller sample (diluted 1e5) shows 4 plumes, indicating fewer infections than expected at that dilution. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (causing issues) interacts with the lytic phage, perhaps through recombination, allowing them to function together. \n\nNow, the goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage DNA. Recombination here likely refers to the point where the two mutations interact\u2014maybe they form a recombinant mutation that has some effect, like combining their effects into a more efficient lysogenic phage.\n\nWhen both phages are present, the combined effect is more pronounced. In the first experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present (diluted 1e7 and on strain B), most of the bacteria die, indicating that the lysogenic phage is effective. When both phages are present (diluted 1e5 and on strain K), the number of plumes (infections) is much lower (4 vs. 40), suggesting that the combination reduces the number of infections.\n\nThis reduction in plumes when both phages are present indicates that there is some interaction or recombination between them. To model this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p * q) / N,\n\nwhere p is the frequency of one mutation, q is the frequency of the other, and N is the total number of cells plated. Alternatively, considering that the probability of an infection from each phage is independent would be p * q, but when they coexist, the observed effect depends on their interaction.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to consider that when both mutations are present, the number of plumes should decrease by the product of their frequencies. Since both mutations are rare, we can approximate using the rule of three or the concept of combining probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. Normally, without any interaction, the expectation would be proportional to the sum of their individual probabilities. But when they interact, the expectation decreases.\n\nLet me denote the frequency of each mutation as p and q. Since both mutations are rare, p + q \u2248 1, and p*q would be very small. However, when both are present, the combined effect is such that the number of plumes is reduced. Specifically, the observed number of plumes is N * (p + q - pq) / (N_total). Wait, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the number of plumes is given by N * (p * q) / (p + q). But I'm not sure. Perhaps a better approach is to look at the ratio of plumes when both are present compared to when only one is present.\n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present (on strain B): Number of plumes = 40.\n\nWhen both phages are present (on strain K): Number of plumes = 4.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage alone leads to 40 plumes, and the presence of the lytic phage alone leads to 40 plumes (but in reality, the lysogenic phage is more potent?), then the combined effect is less.\n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage alone (on strain B) causes death, implying that its presence is effective. When both are present, the number of plumes is lower, suggesting that the lytic phage is somehow reducing the effect of the lysogenic phage.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can assume that the observed effect is due to the combination of the two mutations. Using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p * q) / (p + q).\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the probability of an infection is p * q, and the number of plumes would be proportional to this. Given that on strain B, only the lysogenic phage is present, and the number of plumes is high (40), while on strain K, both phages are present and the number is low (4), we can set up equations to solve for the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s define f as the recombination frequency (the proportion of cells where the two mutations interact). Then, the expected number of plumes when both phages are present on strain K would be proportional to f * p * q.\n\nGiven that when only lysogenic is present (strain B), the number of plumes is 40. When both are present (strain K), the number is 4. Assuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage alone (strain B) produces 40 plumes, which implies that p = 1 (since only lysogenic is present), but that contradicts the fact that when both are present, the number drops. Therefore, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes, and the presence of the lytic phage alone causes 40 plumes, but their combination reduces it further.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is f, then the probability of an infection when both are present is f * p * q. Since both mutations are rare, p \u2248 q \u2248 f (because recombination occurs at the site of replication, making the phage more likely to integrate).\n\nWait, but recombination frequency usually refers to the occurrence rate, so perhaps f is the fraction of cells where the two mutations interact. Thus, the expected number of plumes when both are present would be proportional to f * p * q.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present (strain B):\nNumber of plumes = 40.\n\nWhen only lytic is present (strain K):\nNumber of plumes = ?\n\nWait, no, according to the problem statement, when both are present, the number of plumes on strain K is 4. On strain B, it's 40.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\nThe other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\nFour plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\n\nSo, half of the population is treated with lysogenic phage and E. coli strain B, leading to 40 plumes.\n\nThe other half is treated with both phages and E. coli strain K, leading to 4 plumes.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the lysogenic phage alone is effective against strain B, while the combination of both phages is less effective against strain K.\n\nNow, assuming that when both phages are present, the number of plumes is proportional to the recombination frequency times the product of their frequencies. Since both mutations are rare, their frequencies p and q are small, and f is also small.\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present, the number of plumes is proportional to (1 - f) * p, where f is the recombination frequency and p is the frequency of the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, when only lytic is present, it's proportional to q. But when both are present, it's proportional to f * p * q.\n\nGiven that, when both are present, the number of plumes is 4, and when only lysogenic is present, it's 40. We can write:\n\n(1 - f) * p = 40 / C,\nf * p * q = 4 / C,\n\nwhere C is a constant representing the number of cells plated.\n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\n(f * p * q) / [(1 - f) * p] = 4 / 40,\n=> (f * q) / (1 - f) = 1/10.\n\nSince both mutations are rare, f and q are small. Let's assume that q \u2248 f, so:\n\nf * f / (1 - f) \u2248 1/10,\n=> f\u00b2 \u2248 1/10,\n=> f \u2248 sqrt(1/10) \u2248 0.316.\n\nThat's approximately 0.3 percent. Wait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equations. Let me try again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- C = total number of cells plated (same for both).\n- p = frequency of lysogenic phage (only present in strain B group),\n- q = frequency of lytic phage (only present in strain K group),\n- f = recombination frequency.\n\nThen, when only lysogenic is present:\nNumber of plumes = (1 - f) * p = 40 / C.\n\nWhen only lytic is present:\nNumber of plumes = q = 40 / C.\n\nWhen both are present:\nNumber of plumes = f * p * q = 4 / C.\n\nFrom the second equation, q = 40 / C.\n\nSubstitute q into the third equation:\n\nf * p * (40 / C) = 4 / C.\n\nMultiply both sides by C:\n\nf * p * 40 = 4,\n=> f * p = 4 / 40 = 1/10.\n\nFrom the first equation, (1 - f)*p = 40/C. But since q = 40/C, and q = (1 - f)*p, then:\n\nq = (1 - f)*p = 40/C.\n\nBut from above, f*p = 1/10.\n\nLet\u2019s express p from the third equation: p = 1/(10*f).\n\nPlug into the second equation:\n\nq = (1 - f)*(1/(10*f)) = 40/C.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know C yet. However, we can relate q and p via the assumption that both mutations are rare, so q \u2248 f and p \u2248 f. Wait, but earlier I thought p and q were frequencies of the individual mutations, but now I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, when only lysogenic is present, the number of plumes is proportional to (1 - f) * p, where f is the recombination frequency, and p is the frequency of the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, when only lytic is present, it's proportional to q, the frequency of the lytic mutation. When both are present, it's proportional to f * p * q.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that when only lysogenic is present, the number of plumes is 40, and when both are present, it's 4, we can set up the following ratios:\n\n(1 - f) * p / (f * p * q) = 40 / 4,\n=> (1/f) * (1 - f) / q = 10.\n\nBut without knowing f or q, this might not help directly. Alternatively, considering that both mutations are rare, we can approximate that p \u2248 f and q \u2248 f, so:\n\n(1 - f)/f\u00b2 \u2248 10.\n\nSolving for f:\n\n(1 - f) \u2248 10 f\u00b2,\n1 \u2248 10 f\u00b2 + f,\nAssuming f is small, 10 f\u00b2 dominates over f, so:\n10 f\u00b2 \u2248 1,\nf\u00b2 \u2248 0.1,\nf \u2248 sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with the previous answer. Earlier I got around 0.3%, but now I'm getting 31.6%. Which is correct?\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, the user mentions that when both phages are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, whereas the other half is affected more in E. coli strain K. The numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage alone causes full death (40 plumes), while the combination with the lytic phage causes only 4 plumes.\n\nUsing the model:\n\nNumber of plumes when only lysogenic is present: 40 = (1 - f) * p,\n\nNumber of plumes when both are present: 4 = f * p * q,\n\nAnd when only lytic is present: let's call it y, which would be similar to q, but I'm not sure. However, from the given data, when only lysogenic is present, it's 40, so when only lytic is present, it must be y = ... Let's say when only lytic is present, the number of plumes is y.\n\nBut without knowing y, perhaps I can ignore it since the problem asks for the recombination frequency, which relates the two.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the relationship between the two cases:\n\nFrom the first case:\n40 = (1 - f) * p.\n\nFrom the third case:\n4 = f * p * q.\n\nAssuming that both p and q are frequencies of the respective mutations, and that f is the recombination frequency, then we can write:\n\nFrom the first equation:\np = 40 / [(1 - f)].\n\nFrom the third equation:\n4 = f * [40 / (1 - f)] * q.\n\nSimplify:\n4 = (40 f q) / (1 - f).\n\nRearrange:\n4 (1 - f) = 40 f q,\n4 - 4f = 40 f q,\n4 = 40 f q + 4f,\n4 = f (40 q + 4),\nThus,\nf = 4 / (40 q + 4).\n\nBut without knowing q, this isn't helpful. Alternatively, if we assume that p and q are related through the recombination frequency, perhaps f = p * q.\n\nWait, that might make sense. If the two mutations are integrated at frequency f, then the probability of their coexistence is f. So, the probability that both mutations are present is f, hence the expected number of plumes would involve f * p * q.\n\nBut I'm still stuck because I don't have enough information. Perhaps the best approach is to use the ratio of plumes to estimate f.\n\nFrom the first scenario (only lysogenic):\n\nNumber of plumes = 40 = (1 - f) * p.\n\nFrom the second scenario (both present):\n\nNumber of plumes = 4 = f * p * q.\n\nAssuming that q is the frequency of the lytic phage, which is absent in the first scenario, so q = 0? Wait, no, in the first scenario, only lysogenic is present, so lysogenic is present at frequency p, and lytic is absent, so q = 0. But that can't be right because then f would be zero, leading to zero plumes, but we do have plumes.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to reconsider. When both phages are present, the lysogenic phage may interfere with the lytic phage, reducing its effectiveness. This could happen if the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage's replication mechanism, thereby modulating its activity. In such a case, the presence of lysogenic phage would reduce the number of plasmids available for the lytic phage, thus reducing the number of plumes caused by the lytic phage.\n\nIn terms of modeling this, the presence of the lysogenic phage could act as a modifier. The number of plumes produced by the lytic phage would be influenced by the presence of the lysogenic phage. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the lytic phage, it might reduce the lytic phage's replication efficiency, thereby increasing the likelihood of resistance (more plumes) or decreased resistance (fewer plumes), depending on context.\n\nWait, but in our case, when both phages are present on strain K, there are fewer plumes (4) than when only lysogenic is present (40). So, the presence of the lysogenic phage alone allows the lytic phage to replicate efficiently, causing more plumes. However, when both are present, the lysogenic phage's presence modulates the lytic phage's activity, possibly decreasing the number of plumes.\n\nPerhaps the lysogenic phage itself acts as a modifier. For example, when the lysogenic phage is present, it may cause the lytic phage to be less active, either by integrating into their replication",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nThe problem states that when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. That might indicate that the lysogenic phage (which was causing some issues) is somehow interacting with the lytic phage. However, the results showed that half the culture (on strain B's lawn) had 40 plumes, and the other half (on strain K's lawn) had 4 plumes. Wait, no, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So the first half (diluted 1e7) is on strain B, giving 40 plumes, and the second half (diluted 1e5) is on strain K, giving 4 plumes. \n\nWait, no, the user wrote: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Hmm, no, the user said: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" No, wait, the original text says: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" Wait, no, that seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal text:\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\nThe other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\nFour plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\"\n\nSo, half of the total population (if the original was split into two equal parts) is dilute 1e7 and plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is dilute 1e5 and plated on strain K, resulting in 4 plumes. Wait, but the initial division probably has two groups: one group is the same as the original, and another group is a different fraction. Maybe it's a standard split where one group is larger (diluted 1e7), and the other is smaller (diluted 1e5), leading to more plumes in the larger sample. Because dilution affects the number of cells plated; higher dilution means fewer cells, lower dilution means more cells. So if you plate more cells, you get more chances for infection. \n\nIn the first case, the larger sample (diluted 1e7) shows 40 plumes, meaning more infections than expected at that dilution. The smaller sample (diluted 1e5) shows 4 plumes, indicating fewer infections than expected at that dilution. This suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (causing issues) interacts with the lytic phage, perhaps through recombination, allowing them to function together. \n\nNow, the goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage DNA. Recombination here likely refers to the point where the two mutations interact\u2014maybe they form a recombinant mutation that has some effect, like combining their effects into a more efficient lysogenic phage.\n\nWhen both phages are present, the combined effect is more pronounced. In the first experiment, when only the lysogenic phage is present (diluted 1e7 and on strain B), most of the bacteria die, indicating that the lysogenic phage is effective. When both phages are present (diluted 1e5 and on strain K), the number of plumes (infections) is much lower (4 vs. 40), suggesting that the combination reduces the number of infections.\n\nThis reduction in plumes when both phages are present indicates that there is some interaction or recombination between them. To model this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p * q) / N,\n\nwhere p is the frequency of one mutation, q is the frequency of the other, and N is the total number of cells plated. Alternatively, considering that the probability of an infection from each phage is independent would be p * q, but when they coexist, the observed effect depends on their interaction.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to consider that when both mutations are present, the number of plumes should decrease by the product of their frequencies. Since both mutations are rare, we can approximate using the rule of three or the concept of combining probabilities.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate the expected number of plumes when both mutations are present. Normally, without any interaction, the expectation would be proportional to the sum of their individual probabilities. But when they interact, the expectation decreases.\n\nLet me denote the frequency of each mutation as p and q. Since both mutations are rare, p + q \u2248 1, and p*q would be very small. However, when both are present, the combined effect is such that the number of plumes is reduced. Specifically, the observed number of plumes is N * (p + q - pq) / (N_total). Wait, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the number of plumes is given by N * (p * q) / (p + q). But I'm not sure. Perhaps a better approach is to look at the ratio of plumes when both are present compared to when only one is present.\n\nWhen only the lysogenic phage is present (on strain B): Number of plumes = 40.\n\nWhen both phages are present (on strain K): Number of plumes = 4.\n\nAssuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage alone leads to 40 plumes, and the presence of the lytic phage alone leads to 40 plumes (but in reality, the lysogenic phage is more potent?), then the combined effect is less.\n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage alone (on strain B) causes death, implying that its presence is effective. When both are present, the number of plumes is lower, suggesting that the lytic phage is somehow reducing the effect of the lysogenic phage.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can assume that the observed effect is due to the combination of the two mutations. Using the formula for interference:\n\nNumber of plumes = (p * q) / (p + q).\n\nBut I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering that when both mutations are present, the probability of an infection is p * q, and the number of plumes would be proportional to this. Given that on strain B, only the lysogenic phage is present, and the number of plumes is high (40), while on strain K, both phages are present and the number is low (4), we can set up equations to solve for the recombination frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s define f as the recombination frequency (the proportion of cells where the two mutations interact). Then, the expected number of plumes when both phages are present on strain K would be proportional to f * p * q.\n\nGiven that when only lysogenic is present (strain B), the number of plumes is 40. When both are present (strain K), the number is 4. Assuming that the presence of the lysogenic phage alone (strain B) produces 40 plumes, which implies that p = 1 (since only lysogenic is present), but that contradicts the fact that when both are present, the number drops. Therefore, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage alone causes 40 plumes, and the presence of the lytic phage alone causes 40 plumes, but their combination reduces it further.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is f, then the probability of an infection when both are present is f * p * q. Since both mutations are rare, p \u2248 q \u2248 f (because recombination occurs at the site of replication, making the phage more likely to integrate).\n\nWait, but recombination frequency usually refers to the occurrence rate, so perhaps f is the fraction of cells where the two mutations interact. Thus, the expected number of plumes when both are present would be proportional to f * p * q.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nWhen only lysogenic is present (strain B):\nNumber of plumes = 40.\n\nWhen only lytic is present (strain K):\nNumber of plumes = ?\n\nWait, no, according to the problem statement, when both are present, the number of plumes on strain K is 4.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B.",
    "rollout": " But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing some effect, while the lytic phage isn't. Now, considering the double-dilution assay: first, you plate a mix where the concentrations are such that the expected number of phages is low enough to cause a certain number of plumes. Then, you dilute further to increase the probability of seeing more plumes. In the first experiment, they plate on strain B with a higher dilution factor than usual (1e5 instead of 1e6), which increases the chance of seeing more plumes because each phage has a higher chance of infecting. They see 40 plumes on B. On the other side, they plate on strain K with a lower dilution factor (1e7), expecting fewer plumes but got 4. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Normally, a higher dilution would lead to fewer plumes because each phage has a lower chance. But here, it's showing more plumes on B at a higher dilution. Maybe the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of double infection? Or perhaps they're causing some interaction. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being expressed differently, leading to higher expression levels. The result is that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage is overexpressed, leading to more infections. So the recombination refers to the interaction between the two mutants, leading to increased expression. To quantify this, we can use the formula for recombinant frequency: R = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals). Here, the total is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinants depends on the degree of recombination (h). The expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to h * N, where N is the number of plumes from one condition. Assuming that the expected number of recombinant plumes is around 4, then h \u2248 4 / 44 \u2248 9.09%, which is way too high. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the actual number of recombinants is 4 - 40, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, the ratio might be different. Wait, maybe the formula should consider the dilution ratios. The initial dilution was 1e5, and then another 1e5, making 1e10. The second dilution was 1e7, which is 1/100th of the first. So the product of the dilutions gives the overall dilution factor. For the first condition, the dilution is 1e5, and for the second, it's 1e7. The product is 1e12, which is much higher than normal. Maybe the expected recombinant plumes are calculated as (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes: E = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions for each mutation. But without knowing R1 and R2, this approach might not work. Another way is to calculate the ratio of plumes. Since the total plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, the ratio is 40:4 or 10:1. This implies that the recombination fraction is 1/10, meaning a 10% recombination rate. Converting that to percentage, it's 10%, which isn't one of the options directly. However, looking back at the options, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. None match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Let's try again. The double-dilution assay shows that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage is overexpressed. The ratio of plumes on B (40) to K (4) suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more abundant on B than on K. This could indicate a recombination event where the lysogenic phage is expressed in combination with the lytic phage. Recombination events typically reduce the individual expression of genes, so the combined effect would increase the expression level. The degree of recombination (h) can be estimated from the observed ratio. Using the formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes, E = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions. Without knowing R1 and R2, but assuming R1 and R2 are similar, say 0.1 each, then E = 0.1*0.1/(0.1+0.1) = 0.05. So the expected number of recombinant plumes is 5% of the total. Here, the total is 44, so 5% of 44 is approximately 2.2. But the observed is 4 on B and 40 on K. The difference suggests that the actual recombination rate is higher. Alternatively, if the observed recombinant plumes are 4 out of 44, that's ~9%, which is too high. Perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another method is to calculate the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more common on B than on K. Since the lysogenic phage is overexpressed in B due to recombination, the recombination fraction (h) can be calculated using the formula h = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2). If R1 and R2 are both 0.1, then h=0.01, which is 1%. But wait, in reality, the recombination fraction is often given as the percentage of the maximum possible (which is 100%). So 1% would correspond to 0.01. Alternatively, sometimes it's presented as the fraction of the maximum, so 1% would be 0.01, but in terms of the options, none have 0.01. Looking back, the options include 0.05%, 0.1%, etc. So if the calculation leads to 0.01 (or 1%), which isn't listed, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C (1.5%) based on the ratio of 40:4=10:1, indicating that the recombination fraction is sqrt(10)=3.16, but that's not matching any option either. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, the expected recombinant frequency is (plume_B - plume_K)/plume_total = (40-4)/44\u22489.09%, which is close to 10%. But this isn't one of the options. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The standard method uses the formula h = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions. Assuming R1 and R2 are equal, h becomes (R^2)/(2R) )= R/2. But without knowing R, this isn't helpful. Alternatively, if the ratio of plumes is 10:1, implying that the recombination fraction is 1/10, then h=1/10=10%, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the observed recombination fraction. The expected number of recombinant plumes would be (R1 * R2)/(R1 + R2). If R1 and R2 are both 0.1, then E=0.01. With 44 plumes, 1% of them are recombinant, which is 0.44. But we observed 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44. So 40 are on K, which is almost all of them, suggesting a very high recombination rate. Wait, but 40 out of 44 is roughly 90.9%, which is way above 1%. That suggests a huge recombination rate, which might imply a recombination event at the DNA level rather than the gene level. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes indicates the degree of recombination. The observed ratio is 40:4=10:1, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more common on B than on K. Since the lysogenic phage is overexpressed in B due to recombination, the recombination fraction can be approximated by taking the square root of the ratio. sqrt(10)=3.16, so the recombination fraction is about 3.16%. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%) because the ratio is 10:1, which is close to 100%, but that's not exact. Alternatively, considering that 10:1 corresponds to a 10% increase, which isn't an option, but perhaps the closest is H (5%) if considering the square root. However, none of the options seem to fit perfectly. Maybe I should reconsider the approach. Another method is to calculate the ratio of plumes. The ratio is 40:4=10:1, which suggests that the recombination fraction is 10%. But since 10% isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D (0.05%) because 4 out of 44 is about 9%, which is close to 0.05% if considering a very small recombination fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F (0.3%) because 4/44\u22489%, which is roughly 0.09%, rounding to 0.1%, but that's still not an option. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I (0.02%) because 4/44\u22489%, which rounds to 0.09%, closer to 0.1%, but again, no option matches.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. But according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing some effect, while the lytic phage isn't. Now, considering the double-dilution assay: first, you plate a mix where the concentrations are such that the expected number of phages is low enough to cause a certain number of plumes. Then, you dilute further to increase the probability of seeing more plumes. In the first experiment, they plate on strain B with a higher dilution factor than usual (1e5 instead of 1e6), which increases the chance of seeing more plumes because each phage has a higher chance of infecting. They see 40 plumes on B. On the other side, they plate on strain K with a lower dilution factor (1e7), expecting fewer plumes but got 4. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Normally, a higher dilution would lead to fewer plumes because each phage has a lower chance. But here, it's showing more plumes on B at a higher dilution. Maybe the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of double infection? Or perhaps they're causing some interaction. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being expressed differently, leading to higher expression levels. The result is that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage is overexpressed, leading to more infections. So the recombination refers to the interaction between the two mutants, leading to increased expression. To quantify this, we can use the formula for recombinant frequency: R = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total number of individuals). Here, the total is 40 + 4 = 44. The number of recombinants depends on the degree of recombination (h). The expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to h * N, where N is the number of plumes from one condition. Assuming that the expected number of recombinant plumes is around 4, then h \u2248 4 / 44 \u2248 9.09%, which is way too high. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the actual number of recombinants is 4 - 40, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, the ratio might be different. Wait, maybe the formula should consider the dilution ratios. The initial dilution was 1e5, and then another 1e5, making 1e10. The second dilution was 1e7, which is 1/100th of the first. So the product of the dilutions gives the overall dilution factor. For the first condition, the dilution is 1e5, and for the second, it's 1e7. The product is 1e12, which is much higher than normal. Maybe the expected recombinant plumes are calculated as (N1 * N2) / (N1 + N2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes: E = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions for each mutation. But without knowing R1 and R2, this approach might not work. Another way is to calculate the ratio of plumes. Since the total plumes on B are 40 and on K are 4, the ratio is 40:4 or 10:1. This implies that the recombination fraction is 1/10, meaning a 10% recombination rate. Converting that to percentage, it's 10%, which isn't one of the options directly. However, looking back at the options, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. None match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Let's try again. The double-dilution assay shows that when both mutants are present, the lysogenic phage is overexpressed. The ratio of plumes on B (40) to K (4) suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more abundant on B than on K. This could indicate a recombination event where the lysogenic phage is expressed in combination with the lytic phage. Recombination events typically reduce the individual expression of genes, so the combined effect would increase the expression level. The degree of recombination (h) can be estimated from the observed ratio. Using the formula for the expected number of recombinant plumes, E = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions. Without knowing R1 and R2, but assuming R1 and R2 are similar, say 0.1 each, then E = 0.1*0.1/(0.1+0.1) = 0.05. So the expected number of recombinant plumes is 5% of the total. Here, the total is 44, so 5% of 44 is approximately 2.2. But the observed is 4 on B and 40 on K. The difference suggests that the actual recombination rate is higher. Alternatively, if the observed recombinant plumes are 4 out of 44, that's ~9%, which is too high. Perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another method is to calculate the ratio of plumes. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4=10:1. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more common on B than on K. Since the lysogenic phage is overexpressed in B due to recombination, the recombination fraction (h) can be calculated using the formula h = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2). If R1 and R2 are both 0.1, then h=0.01, which is 1%. But wait, in reality, the recombination fraction is often given as the percentage of the maximum possible (which is 100%). So 1% would correspond to 0.01. Alternatively, sometimes it's presented as the fraction of the maximum, so 1% would be 0.01, but in terms of the options, none have 0.01. Looking back, the options include 0.05%, 0.1%, etc. So if the calculation leads to 0.01 (or 1%), which isn't listed, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C (1.5%) based on the ratio of 40:4=10:1, indicating that the recombination fraction is sqrt(10)=3.16, but that's not matching any option either. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, the expected recombinant frequency is (plume_B - plume_K)/plume_total = (40-4)/44\u22489.09%, which is close to 10%. But this isn't one of the options. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The standard method uses the formula h = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2), where R1 and R2 are the recombination fractions. Assuming R1 and R2 are equal, h becomes (R^2)/(2R) )= R/2. But without knowing R, this isn't helpful. Alternatively, if the ratio of plumes is 10:1, implying that the recombination fraction is 1/10, then h=1/10=10%, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the observed recombination fraction. The expected number of recombinant plumes would be (R1 * R2)/(R1 + R2). If R1 and R2 are both 0.1, then E=0.01. With 44 plumes, 1% of them are recombinant, which is 0.44. But we observed 4 on B and 40 on K, totaling 44. So 40 are on K, which is almost all of them, suggesting a very high recombination rate. Wait, but 40 out of 44 is roughly 90.9%, which is way above 1%. That suggests a huge recombination rate, which might imply a recombination event at the DNA level rather than the gene level. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the ratio of plumes indicates the degree of recombination. The observed ratio is 40:4=10:1, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is 10 times more common on B than on K. Since the lysogenic phage is overexpressed in B due to recombination, the recombination fraction can be approximated by taking the square root of the ratio. sqrt(10)=3.16, so the recombination fraction is about 3.16%. But this isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H (5%) because the ratio is 10:1, which is close to 100%, but that's not exact. Alternatively, considering that 10:1 corresponds to a 10% increase, which isn't an option, but perhaps the closest is H (5%) if considering the square root. However, none of the options seem to fit perfectly. Maybe I should reconsider the approach. Another method is to calculate the ratio of plumes. The ratio is 40:4=10:1, which suggests that the recombination fraction is 10%.

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Wait, no, it says that half is diluted 1:10^7 and half is diluted 1:10^5. So the first group has less phage, so fewer chances to infect, but maybe more susceptible? Or vice versa. Alternatively, the presence of both mutants might lead to some phenomenon like double resistance or something else. But the key is that the first sample had 40 plumes and the second had 4. Hmm, wait, no\u2014actually, the problem states that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage probably isn't the main issue here, but the lysogenic phage may interact with the lysogenic phage in some way. Alternatively, maybe the two mutants combine to cause something different. Now, looking at the numbers: half the bacteria are in the first dilution (1:1e7), and half are in the second (1:1e5). The first half shows 40 plumes, and the second shows 4. Wait, but if the first half is less rich in phages, perhaps the lysogenic phage in the first sample isn't enough to affect all the cells as much, whereas the second sample, being more rich, allows more plasmid replication. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider the expected outcomes without any recombination. If there's no recombination, then the presence of either mutation would cause the same effect. However, in reality, mutations often recombine, leading to new combinations. If recombination occurs, the number of plasmids in the offspring could be different. In this case, if the mutations recombine, the resulting phage would have a combination of the two mutations, potentially reducing their effectiveness because the two mutations together create a new phage that's less effective than either individually. So if recombination occurs, the presence of both mutations would result in a lower number of plasmids compared to when only one mutation is present. Let me try to model this. Suppose the probability of recombination is 'r'. Without recombination, the frequency of the lysogenic phage would be 'f', and the wild type would be '1-f' or similar. But with recombination, the actual distribution depends on the rate. Alternatively, considering that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would dominate, but when recombines, the presence of both mutations leads to a decrease in the number of plasmids because the recombinant form is less likely due to selection pressures. So the observed number of plasmids (plumes) in the two samples would reflect whether the mutations are combining or not. If the mutations are not recombining, then the presence of both mutations in a bacterium would reduce its ability to replicate, hence fewer plasmids. But the opposite is happening: the presence of both mutations in the E. coli is causing more plasmids than just having one mutation. Wait, no\u2014the initial scenario says that when only the lysogenic phage is present, E. coli strain B is affected. When both are present, E. coli B is still mostly affected. That suggests that the lysogenic phage alone is sufficient to cause effects, and adding another mutation doesn't further increase the susceptibility. Therefore, the presence of both mutations doesn't enhance the effect; instead, it may interfere with the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutations act synergistically, creating a more efficient lysogen. No, usually recombination reduces efficiency. So if recombination occurs, the presence of both mutations would lead to a combination that is less effective than either mutation alone. Therefore, in the presence of both mutations, the number of plasmids would be lower than expected from individual mutations. Conversely, if there was no recombination, the presence of both mutations would lead to a higher number of plasmids. So in our experiment, we see that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids is lower than when only one mutation is present. That supports the idea of recombination. Now, let's relate this to the calculation. The formula for estimating the likelihood of recombination based on plasmid frequencies can be used here. The expected number of plasmids (or plasmid copies) in the presence of recombination can be calculated using the formula:\n\np = p1 + p2 - r * p1 * p2\n\nWhere:\n- p1 and p2 are the probabilities of the two mutations.\n- r is the rate of recombination.\n\nBut in our case, the observed number of plasmids differs from expectations. Since the presence of both mutations leads to fewer plasmids, we can infer that recombination occurred. Now, to calculate the percentage recombination. We know that when both mutations are present, the number of plasmids is reduced. The reduction can help us determine the degree of recombination. The formula to estimate the percentage recombination (R%) is:\n\nR% = [ (Observed - Expected) / Expected ] * 100\n\nHere, Observed is the number of plasmids when both mutations are present, and Expected is the number when only one mutation is present. However, in our case, the expectation when both are present is lower than when only one is present. So let's define:\n\nWhen only lysogenic phage is present (no recombination):\n- All E. coli will have the lysogenic phage, and thus, some proportion (say, q) will produce a certain number of plasmids. Wait, but in our experiment, the presence of both mutations leads to fewer plasmids. So maybe the presence of both mutations reduces the overall plasmid load. Alternatively, maybe the recombination fraction (h) can be estimated using the ratio of plasmid frequencies. The h value is the proportion of recombinants relative to the total parental population. It ranges from 0% (no recombination) to 100% (complete recombination).\n\nThe formula for h is:\n\nh = (observed recombinants) / (total observed)\n\nIn our case, the total plasmid count is split into those where only lysogenic phage is present and those where both mutations are present. The observed recombinants would correspond to the plasmids caused by both mutations. The expected recombinants (if recombination happened) would depend on the recombination rate. However, without knowing the exact recombination rates, we can make assumptions. Alternatively, since the presence of both mutations leads to fewer plasmids, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that when only one mutation is present, the average number of plasmids is p. When both mutations are present, the average number is p - r * p1 * p2, where r is the recombination rate. However, without specific values for p1, p2, or r, this becomes challenging. Instead, perhaps we can use the ratio of plasmids in the two groups to estimate h. \n\nGiven that the first group (only lysogenic) has 40 plemes, and the second group (both mutations) has 4 plemes. Assuming that when only one mutation is present, each bacterium has a certain number of plasmids, say N. When both mutations are present, each bacterium has a lower number, say M. The ratio M/N gives us information about the recombination. The recombination fraction (h) is approximately equal to M/N. \n\nIf there is no recombination, then M = N.

Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, possibly combining their effects. Now, the number of plumes found on each strain indicates how many successful infections occurred. On strain B, there were 4 plumes, while on strain K, there were 40. That seems like a significant difference. Wait, no, wait\u2014the phage concentrations are different. The first sample was diluted 1:1e7, meaning 1 phage per 1e7 cells. The second was 1:1e5, so 1 phage per 1e5 cells. But the number of plumes on K was much higher\u201440 vs. 4. Hmm, that seems odd unless the interactions affect the outcome differently depending on the concentration. Maybe the presence of the phages affects each other inversely, leading to either more or less infection events. Alternatively, perhaps the phage concentration affects how effectively they can infect the target cells. But let's approach this methodically. First, determine the expected outcomes under normal conditions without any recombination. Normally, each mutation type would independently cause problems. However, in reality, they may interact. So, in the absence of recombination, we'd expect a certain distribution of plumes. In the presence of recombination, the distribution changes. The key is to find out how much recombination has occurred from the observed data. Let me consider the possible scenarios. Under normal conditions, without recombination, each mutation should cause specific effects. However, when recombination occurs, the combined effect could be different. For example, if the lysogenic phage combines with another mutation, its effect might be additive. Alternatively, the presence of both mutations might reduce the effectiveness of one over the other. Given that only lysogenic phages are problematic when B is infected, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation interacts with the existing mutation(s) in the host. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant DNA experiments. Alternatively, think about the expected number of plumes given the recombination rate. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is N = n * R, where n is the total number of phages and R is the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here. Another approach is to look at the ratio of plumes on each strain. If there was no recombination, we'd expect the distribution to follow Mendelian ratios, but with recombination, it might change. Alternatively, think about the chi-squared test for independence. Let's construct a contingency table. Suppose in the cross of the two strains, the number of plumes on each strain follows a certain pattern due to recombination. Without recombination, the numbers might be proportional to the concentrations or something else. With recombination, it might differ. From the data given: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. This seems like a lot more plumes on K than on B, but considering the dilutions, K had a lower dilution factor. Wait, the plumes represent the number of successful infections. So higher concentrations (lower dilution factors) would mean more plumes. But here, K had a higher concentration (1:1e5), yet fewer plumes (40) compared to B's 4 plumes (1:1e7). That suggests that even though K had more cells, the lower concentration (higher dilution) resulted in fewer plumes. Alternatively, maybe the combination of mutations leads to increased or decreased susceptibility. Alternatively, think about the expected number of plumes given no recombination versus recombination. If no recombination, then the ratio would depend on the concentrations, but if recombination exists, the ratio changes. Maybe the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes on one strain more than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is related to the product of the concentrations. Let me try calculating the expected number under no recombination. Without recombination, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the square root of the product of the concentrations. Because when dealing with independent events, the expected number is sqrt(n1*n2). Here, n1 is 1e7 and n2 is 1e5, so sqrt(1e7*1e5)=sqrt(1e12)=1e6. But the observed plumes are 4 and 40, which are way lower. So no recombination isn't plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination leads to a different calculation. Maybe the actual formula accounts for the recombination rate. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is given by:\n\nR = (n1 + n2 - N)/2\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the chi-squared test. Let's create a table. Suppose in the cross of the two strains, the number of plumes on each strain is as follows. Assuming total plumes across both groups are 44 (4+40=44). If there was no recombination, we'd expect the plumes to be distributed proportionally according to the concentrations. The dilution factors are 1e7 (B) and 1e5 (K). The expected number of plumes on B would be (1e7 / (1e7 + 1e5)))*44 \u2248 (1e7 / 1e7)*(44/4)=approx 44? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the expectation depends on the relative contributions. Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the expected counts assuming no recombination. The expected count for each strain would be proportional to the probability of being in that group multiplied by the total plumes. The probability of being on B is 1/(1e7 +1e5)=1/1.001e7\u22489.99e-8. Similarly for K. Then, expected plumes on B would be 44*(9.99e-8)=~0.000044, which is almost zero. On K, similarly, ~0.000044. But our observed values are 4 and 40, which is way higher. Therefore, no recombination isn't plausible. So there must be some recombination happening. How? Perhaps the combination of the two mutations results in a new mutation that confers a different phenotype. So when the phages are present together, they form a recombinant mutation that either enhances or reduces the problem. Now, looking back at the data, strain B is mostly affected, which implies that the lysogenic phage is causing the issue, but when the other type is present, it's resolved. Or perhaps the other type is compensating. Alternatively, the presence of the other mutation decreases the efficacy of the lysogenic phage, so despite having more phages, the overall effect is less severe. Now, focusing on the ratio of plumes. On K, 40 plumes, on B, 4. That's a ratio of 10:1. Considering the dilution factors, K had a higher dilution factor (1e5) compared to B's 1e7. So the ratio of plumes is roughly equal to the ratio of the dilution factors. 1e5 /1e7 =1/10. So 40/4=10, which matches. So that suggests that the presence of the phage in K's population allows for more effective infection, hence more plumes. But why is there such a high number on K? Unless the presence of the phage in K increases the susceptibility. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination leads to a stronger or weaker mutation. If the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with another mutation in the host, it could produce a different phenotype. For instance, suppose the original lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it resistant to B phage. When recombined with another mutation, say a new resistance, it becomes super-resistant. But in this case, the issue arises in B when lysogenic phages are present, but not when the other type is present. So perhaps the other mutation (the non-lysogenic phage) doesn't affect B but does affect K. Wait, but both mutations are present. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a stronger effect, making the lysogenic phage less effective. Or maybe the other mutation suppresses the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with a new mutation that enhances its lytic activity, thus killing the E. coli. Alternatively, the recombination creates a new mutation that confers resistance to B phage, thereby preventing the lysogenic phage's effect. So if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that confers resistance, when it's recombined with another mutation, it becomes super-resistant and can't lyse the host. Thus, when placed on strain B, which lacks the recombining mutation, it's ineffective. Whereas when the other mutation is present, it disrupts the lysogenic phage, allowing it to lyse and kill the host. But in this scenario, when both mutations are present, only the non-lysogenic phage kills the host. However, in the experiment, when the other strain is plated, 40 plumes occur, indicating that most of the lysogenic phages are effective. So perhaps the recombination leads to a super-effective phage, but in this case, the host is not susceptible enough to support such high numbers of plumes. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination introduces a mutation that confers resistance, making the lysogenic phage ineffective. So when recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage loses its ability to lyse and instead becomes resistant, thus not infecting the host. Therefore, in strain B, where the lysogenic phage is already problematic, the recombination adds a resistance mutation, making the lysogenic phage ineffective, hence fewer plumes. Conversely, when the other mutation is present, it disrupts the lysogenic phage, allowing it to infect and lyse the host, resulting in more plumes. So the recombination increases the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the recombination rate contributes to the increase in plumes on K, which is the strain where the lysogenic phage is problematic, and fewer on B, where the other mutation takes over. Now, to quantify the recombination rate. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is often used in genetic experiments. The expected number of recombinant plumes (E) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (n1 * n2) / N_total\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the concentrations of the two parent populations, and N_total is the total concentration. Alternatively, another formula relates the recombination frequency (R) to the observed recombinant plumes (O):\n\nO = (N * R) / (1 + R)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the chi-squared test for goodness of fit. We can set up a contingency table comparing the observed plumes on K and B against what we'd expect under no recombination. Let's denote:\n\nObserved:\nK: 40\nB: 4\n\nExpected under no recombination: assuming no recombination, the number of plumes would depend on the probabilities of each strain carrying the mutation. But without knowing the recombination rate, it's tricky. However, the observed number of plumes on K is significantly higher than expected, suggesting that the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of infection on K. To estimate the recombination rate, we can assume that the number of recombinant plumes is O = (R * N_B * N_K) / (N_B + N_K)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected number of plumes on each strain without recombination would be based on the dilution factors. Since K had a higher dilution factor, it's expected to have more plumes. The observed ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. The dilution factors are 1e5 and 1e7, so the ratio of plumes is approximately equal to the inverse of the dilution factors' ratio, which is 1/10. So 10:1 matches the ratio of plumes. This suggests that the presence of recombination increases the likelihood of infection by a factor of 10, implying a recombination rate of approximately 1% (since a 1% recombination rate would increase the number of plumes by about 10 times). Alternatively, using the formula for the number of recombinant plumes:\n\nO = (n1 * n2 * R) / (n1 + n2)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the concentrations, and R is the recombination frequency (as a fraction). Solving for R:\n\nR = O * (n1 + n2) / (n1 * n2)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nn1 =1e7, n2=1e5, O=40.\n\nSo,\n\nR =40*(1e7 +1e5)/(1e7*1e5)=40*(1.01e7)/(1e12)=40*(1.01e7)/1e12\u224840*1.01e-5\u22480.000404.\n\nThat's approximately 0.04%, which is around 0.05%. Looking at the options, option D is 0.05%, which fits. Alternatively, using the exact formula:\n\nR = O / [(n1/n2) +1]\n\nAssuming n1=1e7, n2=1e5, O=40.\n\nR=40/[10 +1]=40/11\u22483.64%.\n\nThat's too high, so probably my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the correct formula is different. Alternatively, using the formula for the chi-square test. The degrees of freedom would be 1. Calculate the expected counts under no recombination and compare to observed. But without knowing the recombination rate, it's hard. Alternatively, think about the odds. If the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes on K by a factor of 10, then the log odds ratio could help. But I'm not sure. Given the options, 0.05% seems close to 0.04%, which is option D. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, 1.5%, but I'm not confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only lysogenic phages cause issues when B is infected, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing the issue here. So the presence of multiple phages might lead to recombination. Recombination would mean that the two mutations interact, possibly combining their effects. Now, the number of plumes found on each strain indicates how many successful infections occurred. On strain B, there were 4 plumes, while on strain K, there were 40. That seems like a significant difference. Wait, no, wait\u2014the phage concentrations are different. The first sample was diluted 1:1e7, meaning 1 phage per 1e7 cells. The second was 1:1e5, so 1 phage per 1e5 cells. But the number of plumes on K was much higher\u201440 vs. 4. Hmm, that seems odd unless the interactions affect the outcome differently depending on the concentration. Maybe the presence of the phages affects each other inversely, leading to either more or less infection events. Alternatively, perhaps the phage concentration affects how effectively they can infect the target cells. But let's approach this methodically. First, determine the expected outcomes under normal conditions without any recombination. Normally, each mutation type would independently cause problems. However, in reality, they may interact. So, in the absence of recombination, we'd expect a certain distribution of plumes. In the presence of recombination, the distribution changes. The key is to find out how much recombination has occurred from the observed data. Let me consider the possible scenarios. Under normal conditions, without recombination, each mutation should cause specific effects. However, when recombination occurs, the combined effect could be different. For example, if the lysogenic phage combines with another mutation, its effect might be additive. Alternatively, the presence of both mutations might reduce the effectiveness of one over the other. Given that only lysogenic phages are problematic when B is infected, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation interacts with the existing mutation(s) in the host. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant DNA experiments. Alternatively, think about the expected number of plumes given the recombination rate. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is N = n * R, where n is the total number of phages and R is the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here. Another approach is to look at the ratio of plumes on each strain. If there was no recombination, we'd expect the distribution to follow Mendelian ratios, but with recombination, it might change. Alternatively, think about the chi-squared test for independence. Let's construct a contingency table. Suppose in the cross of the two strains, the number of plumes on each strain follows a certain pattern due to recombination. Without recombination, the numbers might be proportional to the concentrations or something else. With recombination, it might differ. From the data given: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. This seems like a lot more plumes on K than on B, but considering the dilutions, K had a lower dilution factor. Wait, the plumes represent the number of successful infections. So higher concentrations (lower dilution factors) would mean more plumes. But here, K had a higher concentration (1:1e5), yet fewer plumes (40) compared to B's 4 plumes (1:1e7). That suggests that even though K had more cells, the lower concentration (higher dilution) resulted in fewer plumes. Alternatively, maybe the combination of mutations leads to increased or decreased susceptibility. Alternatively, think about the expected number of plumes given no recombination versus recombination. If no recombination, then the ratio would depend on the concentrations, but if recombination exists, the ratio changes. Maybe the presence of recombination increases the number of plumes on one strain more than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is related to the product of the concentrations. Let me try calculating the expected number under no recombination. Without recombination, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the square root of the product of the concentrations. Because when dealing with independent events, the expected number is sqrt(n1*n2). Here, n1 is 1e7 and n2 is 1e5, so sqrt(1e7*1e5)=sqrt(1e12)=1e6. But the observed plumes are 4 and 40, which are way lower. So no recombination isn't plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of recombination leads to a different calculation. Maybe the actual formula accounts for the recombination rate. The formula for the number of recombinant plumes is given by:\n\nR = (n1 + n2 - N)/2\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the chi-squared test. Let's create a table. Suppose in the cross of the two strains, the number of plumes on each strain is as follows. Assuming total plumes across both groups are 44 (4+40=44). If there was no recombination, we'd expect the plumes to be distributed proportionally according to the concentrations. The dilution factors are 1e7 (B) and 1e5 (K). The expected number of plumes on B would be (1e7 / (1e7 + 1e5)))*44 \u2248 (1e7 / 1e7)*(44/4)=approx 44? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the expectation depends on the relative contributions. Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the expected counts assuming no recombination. The expected count for each strain would be proportional to the probability of being in that group multiplied by the total plumes. The probability of being on B is 1/(1e7 +1e5)=1/1.001e7\u22489.99e-8. Similarly for K. Then, expected plumes on B would be 44*(9.99e-8)=~0.000044, which is almost zero. On K, similarly, ~0.000044. But our observed values are 4 and 40, which is way higher. Therefore, no recombination isn't plausible. So there must be some recombination happening. How? Perhaps the combination of the two mutations results in a new mutation that confers a different phenotype. So when the phages are present together, they form a recombinant mutation that either enhances or reduces the problem. Now, looking back at the data, strain B is mostly affected, which implies that the lysogenic phage is causing the issue, but when the other type is present, it's resolved. Or perhaps the other type is compensating. Alternatively, the presence of the other mutation decreases the efficacy of the lysogenic phage, so despite having more phages, the overall effect is less severe. Now, focusing on the ratio of plumes. On K, 40 plumes, on B, 4. That's a ratio of 10:1. Considering the dilution factors, K had a higher dilution factor (1e5) compared to B's 1e7. So the ratio of plumes is roughly equal to the ratio of the dilution factors. 1e5 /1e7 =1/10. So 40/4=10, which matches. So that suggests that the presence of the phage in K's population allows for more effective infection, hence more plumes. But why is there such a high number on K? Unless the presence of the phage in K increases the susceptibility. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination leads to a stronger or weaker mutation. If the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with another mutation in the host, it could produce a different phenotype. For instance, suppose the original lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it resistant to B phage. When recombined with another mutation, say a new resistance, it becomes super-resistant. But in this case, the issue arises in B when lysogenic phages are present, but not when the other type is present. So perhaps the other mutation (the non-lysogenic phage) doesn't affect B but does affect K. Wait, but both mutations are present. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a stronger effect, making the lysogenic phage less effective. Or maybe the other mutation suppresses the lysogenic phage. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with a new mutation that enhances its lytic activity, thus killing the E. coli.

Conversely, when the other mutation is present, it disrupts the lysogenic phage, allowing it to infect and lyse the host, resulting in more plumes. So the recombination increases the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the recombination rate contributes to the increase in plumes on K, which is the strain where the lysogenic phage is problematic, and fewer on B, where the other mutation takes over.

The expected number of recombinant plumes (E) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (n1 * n2) / N_total\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the concentrations of the two parent populations, and N_total is the total concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple phages affects their ability to replicate, leading to different outcomes. \n\nThe key point here is the number of plumes observed. Plumes indicate successful infections. If the two mutations are recombined, they might produce a new phage that has properties from both, potentially leading to different outcomes than expected. In the case where both mutations are present, the expected outcome would be less efficient replication due to double-strand breaks, but sometimes they can interact without necessarily producing a lethal strain. However, in this scenario, the outcome isn't as expected. On one hand, strain B shows more plumes (40 vs. 4), suggesting it's more susceptible. On the other hand, strain K shows fewer plumes (4 vs. 40). This discrepancy could indicate that the combination of both mutations leads to decreased susceptibility compared to individual mutations, but why?\n\nWait, no. Normally, when you have two mutations in the same phage, they can either synergize (produce a more potent phage) or interfere (produce a less potent phage). If they interfere, the combined effect might be worse than either alone. But in this case, the presence of both mutations seems to increase the susceptibility to the target strain B because more plumes are found on B despite having fewer on K. That suggests that when both mutations are present, the phage becomes more effective at replicating and causing lysis, even though individually they cause problems. \n\nBut wait, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules, resulting in a new sequence. In the context of phages, this often refers to the combination of two different mutation sequences within the phage's DNA leading to a new, functional mutation. For example, one mutation introduces a break in the phage's DNA, and another mutation provides repair capacity, allowing the two to work together without causing double strand breaks.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutations may lead to recombinatorial events within the phage's genome. If the recombination rate is high, the phages would have a more integrated version of the two mutations, possibly making them more effective. Conversely, low recombination rates would keep the mutations separate, leading to potential interference in replication.\n\nLooking back at the results: when both mutations are present, more phages are infecting strain B. This suggests that the combination of the two mutations enhances the phage's ability to replicate and infect, perhaps because the mutations allow the phage to integrate better or function more efficiently together. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nIf recombination occurred frequently, the two mutations would be more likely to intermingle, creating a new, intact mutation sequence. However, if recombination is infrequent, the mutations would remain distinct, affecting the outcome differently depending on which strain they affect.\n\nGiven the data, the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility to strain B. If recombination was occurring, it might explain why the phages are more effective when both mutations are present. If there's little recombination, then each mutation would independently affect the outcome, leading to a certain distribution of plumes.\n\nTo determine the recombination level, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant phages = (Total phages - Initial phages) * Recombination frequency\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact approach here. Another way is to calculate the probability that a phage has undergone recombination between the two mutations. If the observed effect depends on the recombination frequency, we can estimate it using the ratio of plumes.\n\nAlternatively, the concept of \"recombinant\" versus \"non-recombinant\" phages can help. If most phages show the non-recombinant phenotype (strain B being more susceptible), but some show the recombinant (strain K being more susceptible), the proportion of recombinants can give us an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should recall that in such experiments, the number of recombinant phages can be estimated relative to the total number of phages. Since the problem states that when both mutations are present, strain B has more plumes and strain K has fewer, this implies that the combination caused the phages to be more effective, meaning that some of the phages had undergone recombination, becoming more susceptible.\n\nHowever, without specific numbers on the recombination frequency, it's challenging. But the answer choices suggest percentages, so I need to find which percentage corresponds to the correct recombination level.\n\nAnother approach: if there is complete recombination (i.e., all mutations are present in the same phage), the phage would be highly effective. But in our case, strain B shows higher susceptibility, implying that the presence of both mutations made it more effective, perhaps because of recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. The options are fractions like 1%, 2%, etc. Given that in the experiment, when both mutations are present, the majority of the phages are infecting B more effectively, but some are also infecting K more effectively. This suggests that some phages underwent recombination, allowing them to be more effective against B while still infecting K more easily.\n\nSo, if the recombination frequency is relatively high, say around 1-2%, then the number of recombinant phages would be significant enough to account for the difference in susceptibility between the strains.

In the case where both mutations are present, the expected outcome would be less efficient replication due to double-strand breaks, but sometimes they can interact without necessarily producing a lethal strain. However, in this scenario, the outcome isn't as expected. On one hand, strain B shows more plumes (40 vs. 4), suggesting it's more susceptible. On the other hand, strain K shows fewer plumes (4 vs. 40). This discrepancy could indicate that the combination of both mutations leads to decreased susceptibility compared to individual mutations, but why?\n\nWait, no. Normally, when you have two mutations in the same phage, they can either synergize (produce a more potent phage) or interfere (produce a less potent phage). If they interfere, the combined effect might be worse than either alone. But in this case, the presence of both mutations seems to increase the susceptibility to the target strain B because more plumes are found on B despite having fewer on K. That suggests that when both mutations are present, the phage becomes more effective at replicating and causing lysis, even though individually they cause problems. \n\nBut wait, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination usually refers to the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules, resulting in a new sequence. In the context of phages, this often refers to the combination of two different mutation sequences within the phage's DNA leading to a new, functional mutation. For example, one mutation introduces a break in the phage's DNA, and another mutation provides repair capacity, allowing the two to work together without causing double strand breaks.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutations may lead to recombinatorial events within the phage's genome. If the recombination rate is high, the phages would have a more integrated version of the two mutations, possibly making them more effective. Conversely, low recombination rates would keep the mutations separate, leading to potential interference in replication.\n\nLooking back at the results: when both mutations are present, more phages are infecting strain B. This suggests that the combination of the two mutations enhances the phage's ability to replicate and infect, perhaps because the mutations allow the phage to integrate better or function more efficiently together. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nIf recombination occurred frequently, the two mutations would be more likely to intermingle, creating a new, intact mutation sequence. However, if recombination is infrequent, the mutations would remain distinct, affecting the outcome differently depending on which strain they affect.\n\nGiven the data, the presence of both mutations leads to increased susceptibility to strain B. If recombination was occurring, it might explain why the phages are more effective when both mutations are present. If there's little recombination, then each mutation would independently affect the outcome, leading to a certain distribution of plumes.\n\nTo determine the recombination level, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinant phages = (Total phages - Initial phages) * Recombination frequency\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact approach here. Another way is to calculate the probability that a phage has undergone recombination between the two mutations. If the observed effect depends on the recombination frequency, we can estimate it using the ratio of plumes.\n\nAlternatively, the concept of \"recombinant\" versus \"non-recombinant\" phages can help. If most phages show the non-recombinant phenotype (strain B being more susceptible), but some show the recombinant (strain K being more susceptible), the proportion of recombinants can give us an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should recall that in such experiments, the number of recombinant phages can be estimated relative to the total number of phages. Since the problem states that when both mutations are present, strain B has more plumes and strain K has fewer, this implies that the combination caused the phages to be more effective, meaning that some of the phages had undergone recombination, becoming more susceptible.\n\nHowever, without specific numbers on the recombination frequency, it's challenging. But the answer choices suggest percentages, so I need to find which percentage corresponds to the correct recombination level.\n\nAnother approach: if there is complete recombination (i.e., all mutations are present in the same phage), the phage would be highly effective. But in our case, strain B shows higher susceptibility, implying that the presence of both mutations made it more effective, perhaps because of recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. The options are fractions like 1%, 2%, etc. Given that in the experiment, when both mutations are present, the majority of the phages are infecting B more effectively, but some are also infecting K more effectively. This suggests that some phages underwent recombination, allowing them to be more effective against B while still infecting K more easily.\n\nSo, if the recombination frequency is relatively high, say around 1-2%, then the number of recombinant phages would be significant enough to account for the difference in susceptibility between the strains. Therefore, the amount of recombination must be moderate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages affects the lysogenicity of the other type. In this case, both types cause issues, but when mixed, only certain combinations work. Now, considering the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like the lysogenic phage is working better when the phages are at a lower concentration because their higher number leads to more infections. Wait, no\u2014wait. Let me clarify. When you dilute the phages, lower concentrations mean more plating events, so more potential infections. If the lysogenic phage is causing issues, then having a higher concentration might make more infections, leading to more plumes. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage is not compatible, maybe its presence would reduce the number of successful infections. Alternatively, perhaps the combination of the two types reduces the overall effectiveness, leading to fewer plumes on one strain and more on another. Hmm, perhaps it's a measure of genetic compatibility. If the two mutations are compatible, the phages won't interfere much, so more infections occur. If they're incompatible, fewer infections happen. The question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations are present together (as a heterozygous state) or absent (homozygous). In this scenario, the result shows that when both mutations are present, the E. coli strains show different patterns. Specifically, the resistant strain (likely the lysogenic one) has fewer plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage isn't as effective when combined with a non-lysogenic phage. This could indicate that the two mutations are complementary, allowing the lysogenic phage to integrate without disrupting the host's gene. But wait, the problem states that both types are present, and only the lysogenic phage is bad. Wait, actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be bad because it's supposed to replicate within the host. So why is the lysogenic phage causing issues? Maybe the phages are not compatible. Oh, perhaps the lysogenic phage is integrating into the T_4 genome, making it non-lytic, thus replicating inside the host. However, the lysogenic phage may have some elements that disrupt the lysogenicity of the other phage. So when both are present, only the non-lytic phage (the lysogen) is ineffective, while the lytic phage (non-lytic) is effective. But in reality, lytic phages should lyse the host, so that wouldn't happen. Therefore, perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective, and the lysogenicity of the other phage is disrupted. But in this experiment, the lysogenic phage caused issues. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause issues because it's supposed to replicate inside. Maybe the question is inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are integrating into the T_4 genome, making them non-lytic. Then, when you mix two types of phages, one that integrates and one that doesn't, the integrated phage might not affect the lysogenicity of the other. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so perhaps the integration is happening. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective when there's a non-lytic phage because of cross-reactivity. But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The key is that when the two mutations are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage isn't working. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage is compatible with strain B, but not with strain K. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage is not compatible with strain K. Wait, but the lysogenic phage shouldn't be bad with strain K. So maybe it's the other way around. If the lysogenic phage is bad with strain B, but not with strain K, then the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K's environment makes the phage less effective. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K's environment is causing the phage to replicate outside the host, leading to lysis, hence being bad. But that contradicts the initial statement that lysogenic phages don't lyse the host. So I must be missing something. Let me think about the experiment again. When both mutation types are present, the resulting E. coli show a division where half is treated with 1e7 dilution (more plating) and half with 1e5. The results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Plumes represent infections, so more plumes mean more infections. The presence of more plumes on B than on K suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective when the phages are at a lower concentration because there are fewer cells to infect. Wait, but higher concentration (lower dilution) increases the chance of more infections. So if the lysogenic phage is causing problems, perhaps it's integrating into the host, making it non-lytic. But earlier, I thought lysogenic phages aren't bad. Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the other mutation. So when both are present, the non-lytic phage is bad, but the lytic phage is good. But lysogenic phages shouldn't lyse the host; they should just replicate inside. So maybe the presence of the non-lytic phage disrupts the lysogenicity of the other. For example, the lysogenic phage has elements that make it non-lytic, so even though it's lysogenic, it doesn't lyse the host. Therefore, when mixed with a non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage might not be effective, but the non-lytic phage would be effective. However, in the experiment, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, so perhaps it's not effective when combined with the non-lytic phage. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other phage is non-lytic. Wait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me consider the concept of genetic compatibility. If two mutations are compatible, the phages won't interfere, so more infections occur. If they're incompatible, fewer infections happen. The question is asking about recombination, which relates to whether the mutations are present together. Incompatibility usually refers to the presence of mutations that prevent the phages from replicating within the host, such as integrating into the T_4 genome. Recombination would involve the presence of both mutations in the same phage. If the two mutations are in the same phage, it would lead to interference, reducing the number of successful infections. Now, looking back at the experiment: when both types are present, the E. coli strain B shows more resistance (40 plumes), and strain K shows fewer plumes (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is less effective when combined with the non-lytic phage. So perhaps the lysogenic phage requires a specific arrangement or is incompatible with the other mutation. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the non-lytic phage to replicate without disruption, but in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues. Hmm, perhaps it's the opposite. If the lysogenic phage is non-lytic, then mixing it with a non-lytic phage would not cause issues, but mixing it with a lytic phage would. But in our case, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, so maybe it's not non-lytic. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other phage is non-lytic. I'm still stuck. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations are complementary (they don't disrupt each other), then their presence would increase the chance of successful replication. If they're incompatible, their presence would decrease the chance. The experiment shows that when both are present, E. coli strain B is more resistant (higher plumes), meaning that the lysogenic phage is working better than expected. But lysogenic phages shouldn't be bad. Wait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage is working better, maybe it's because it's not interfering with the host. Alternatively, maybe the phages are integrating, making them non-lytic, so they replicate normally. But the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall the formula for calculating the level of recombination. The number of recombinant plasmids (R) can be estimated using R = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total number of plasmids). Alternatively, the percentage of recombinant plasmids can be calculated as (R * 100)/N, where N is the total number. But I'm not sure how to apply this here. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination can be determined by comparing the observed frequency of recombinant plasmids to the expected frequency under complete incompatibility. Under complete incompatibility, all plasmids are independent, so the number of recombinant plasmids would be zero. If there are some recombinants, it indicates partial incompatibility. The fraction of recombinant plasmids (fR) is given by fR = (R / N) * 100%, where R is the number of recombinant plasmids and N is the total number of plasmids. Here, in the first half, we have 40 plumes on B, and in the second half, 4 on K. Since the plates are divided equally, each half has 40 + 4 = 44 plating events. Wait, no\u2014the first half is 44 plating events (since 1/10^7 dilution gives 10^7 plating events per well, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. Each well has 10^7 or 10^5 cells plated. The total number of plating events in each half would be 10^7 + 10^5 = 10000000 + 100000 = 10010000 \u2248 10^7. So each half had approximately 10^7 plating events. Out of these, 40 resulted in lysogenic phages on B and 4 on K. Wait, no\u2014the 40 plumes are on B, and 4 on K. So total plumes are 44, but each well has ~10^7 plating events, so over 10^7 wells, the total number of plumes would be 44 * 10^7. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect strain B than strain K. But lysogenic phages shouldn't be bad, so this doesn't make sense unless the phages are integrated into the T_4 genome, making them non-lytic. Wait, but lysogenic phages don't lyse the host, so they shouldn't be bad. Unless the phages are disrupting the host's ability to replicate, which is unlikely. I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find a simpler approach. The question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination occurs when two mutations are present in the same phage. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would cause interference, reducing the number of successful infections. The experiment showed that when both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B shows more resistance (40 plumes) than strain K (4 plumes). Assuming that the lysogenic phage is working better, perhaps it's due to recombination. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would reduce the number of successful infections. However, in reality, lysogenic phages are supposed to replicate inside the host without affecting its own replication. So maybe the issue is that the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the other mutation. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the other phage to replicate without disruption, but the lysogenic phage itself isn't bad. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or a known approach. From what I remember, the number of recombinant plasmids (R) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total number of plasmids)\n\nBut I also know that under complete incompatibility, R = 0. If there are some recombinants, it indicates incomplete incompatibility. The fraction of recombinant plasmids (fR) is given by:\n\nfR = (R / N) * 100%\n\nwhere N is the total number of plating events.\n\nIn this experiment, the total number of plating events in each half is 10^7 (from the 1:10^7 dilution) plus 10^5 (from the 1:10^5 dilution), totaling 10^7 + 10^5 \u2248 10^7 plating events. \n\nNow, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So the total number of plumes across both halves is 40 + 4 = 44. However, each half has 10^7 plating events, so the actual number of plumes would be proportional to the number of plating events. Therefore, the proportion of plumes on B relative to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective on B than on K, implying that the lysogenic phage has some mechanism that favors its attachment to B. However, lysogenic phages are supposed to replicate inside the host and do not lyse it. So perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the non-lytic phage to replicate without disruption, but the lysogenic phage itself is not effective when interacting with the other mutation. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would lead to reduced efficiency, resulting in fewer plumes. But in this case, B has more plumes than K, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more effective on B. Perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective because it's integrating into the T_4 genome, making it non-lytic. If that's the case, then when the lysogenic phage is present along with a non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage wouldn't cause issues, but in this experiment, it does. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The result was half the population showing resistance to K, meaning the lysogenic phage is not compatible with strain K's DNA? Or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages affects the lysogenicity of the other type. In this case, both types cause issues, but when mixed, only certain combinations work. Now, considering the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That seems like the lysogenic phage is working better when the phages are at a lower concentration because their higher number leads to more infections. Wait, no\u2014wait. Let me clarify. When you dilute the phages, lower concentrations mean more plating events, so more potential infections. If the lysogenic phage is causing issues, then having a higher concentration might make more infections, leading to more plumes. Conversely, if the lysogenic phage is not compatible, maybe its presence would reduce the number of successful infections. Alternatively, perhaps the combination of the two types reduces the overall effectiveness, leading to fewer plumes on one strain and more on another. Hmm, perhaps it's a measure of genetic compatibility. If the two mutations are compatible, the phages won't interfere much, so more infections occur. If they're incompatible, fewer infections happen. The question asks about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination here refers to whether the two mutations are present together (as a heterozygous state) or absent (homozygous). In this scenario, the result shows that when both mutations are present, the E. coli strains show different patterns. Specifically, the resistant strain (likely the lysogenic one) has fewer plumes, suggesting that the lysogenic phage isn't as effective when combined with a non-lysogenic phage. This could indicate that the two mutations are complementary, allowing the lysogenic phage to integrate without disrupting the host's gene. But wait, the problem states that both types are present, and only the lysogenic phage is bad. Wait, actually, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be bad because it's supposed to replicate within the host. So why is the lysogenic phage causing issues? Maybe the phages are not compatible. Oh, perhaps the lysogenic phage is integrating into the T_4 genome, making it non-lytic, thus replicating inside the host. However, the lysogenic phage may have some elements that disrupt the lysogenicity of the other phage. So when both are present, only the non-lytic phage (the lysogen) is ineffective, while the lytic phage (non-lytic) is effective. But in reality, lytic phages should lyse the host, so that wouldn't happen. Therefore, perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective, and the lysogenicity of the other phage is disrupted. But in this experiment, the lysogenic phage caused issues. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause issues because it's supposed to replicate inside. Maybe the question is inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the phages are integrating into the T_4 genome, making them non-lytic. Then, when you mix two types of phages, one that integrates and one that doesn't, the integrated phage might not affect the lysogenicity of the other. But in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so perhaps the integration is happening. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective when there's a non-lytic phage because of cross-reactivity. But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The key is that when the two mutations are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage isn't working. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage is compatible with strain B, but not with strain K. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage is not compatible with strain K. Wait, but the lysogenic phage shouldn't be bad with strain K. So maybe it's the other way around. If the lysogenic phage is bad with strain B, but not with strain K, then the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K's environment makes the phage less effective. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K's environment is causing the phage to replicate outside the host, leading to lysis, hence being bad. But that contradicts the initial statement that lysogenic phages don't lyse the host. So I must be missing something. Let me think about the experiment again. When both mutation types are present, the resulting E. coli show a division where half is treated with 1e7 dilution (more plating) and half with 1e5. The results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Plumes represent infections, so more plumes mean more infections. The presence of more plumes on B than on K suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective when the phages are at a lower concentration because there are fewer cells to infect. Wait, but higher concentration (lower dilution) increases the chance of more infections. So if the lysogenic phage is causing problems, perhaps it's integrating into the host, making it non-lytic. But earlier, I thought lysogenic phages aren't bad. Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the other mutation. So when both are present, the non-lytic phage is bad, but the lytic phage is good. But lysogenic phages shouldn't lyse the host; they should just replicate inside. So maybe the presence of the non-lytic phage disrupts the lysogenicity of the other. For example, the lysogenic phage has elements that make it non-lytic, so even though it's lysogenic, it doesn't lyse the host. Therefore, when mixed with a non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage might not be effective, but the non-lytic phage would be effective. However, in the experiment, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, so perhaps it's not effective when combined with the non-lytic phage. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other phage is non-lytic. Wait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me consider the concept of genetic compatibility. If two mutations are compatible, the phages won't interfere, so more infections occur. If they're incompatible, fewer infections happen. The question is asking about recombination, which relates to whether the mutations are present together. Incompatibility usually refers to the presence of mutations that prevent the phages from replicating within the host, such as integrating into the T_4 genome. Recombination would involve the presence of both mutations in the same phage. If the two mutations are in the same phage, it would lead to interference, reducing the number of successful infections. Now, looking back at the experiment: when both types are present, the E. coli strain B shows more resistance (40 plumes), and strain K shows fewer plumes (4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is less effective when combined with the non-lytic phage. So perhaps the lysogenic phage requires a specific arrangement or is incompatible with the other mutation. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the non-lytic phage to replicate without disruption, but in this case, the lysogenic phage is causing issues. Hmm, perhaps it's the opposite. If the lysogenic phage is non-lytic, then mixing it with a non-lytic phage would not cause issues, but mixing it with a lytic phage would. But in our case, the lysogenic phage is causing problems, so maybe it's not non-lytic. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other phage is non-lytic. I'm still stuck. Let me think about the possible outcomes. If the two mutations are complementary (they don't disrupt each other), then their presence would increase the chance of successful replication. If they're incompatible, their presence would decrease the chance. The experiment shows that when both are present, E. coli strain B is more resistant (higher plumes), meaning that the lysogenic phage is working better than expected. But lysogenic phages shouldn't be bad. Wait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage is working better, maybe it's because it's not interfering with the host. Alternatively, maybe the phages are integrating, making them non-lytic, so they replicate normally. But the lysogenic phage is causing issues, so perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall the formula for calculating the level of recombination. The number of recombinant plasmids (R) can be estimated using R = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total number of plasmids). Alternatively, the percentage of recombinant plasmids can be calculated as (R * 100)/N, where N is the total number. But I'm not sure how to apply this here. Alternatively, the percentage of recombination can be determined by comparing the observed frequency of recombinant plasmids to the expected frequency under complete incompatibility. Under complete incompatibility, all plasmids are independent, so the number of recombinant plasmids would be zero. If there are some recombinants, it indicates partial incompatibility. The fraction of recombinant plasmids (fR) is given by fR = (R / N) * 100%, where R is the number of recombinant plasmids and N is the total number of plasmids. Here, in the first half, we have 40 plumes on B, and in the second half, 4 on K. Since the plates are divided equally, each half has 40 + 4 = 44 plating events. Wait, no\u2014the first half is 44 plating events (since 1/10^7 dilution gives 10^7 plating events per well, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the dilution factors are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. Each well has 10^7 or 10^5 cells plated. The total number of plating events in each half would be 10^7 + 10^5 = 10000000 + 100000 = 10010000 \u2248 10^7. So each half had approximately 10^7 plating events. Out of these, 40 resulted in lysogenic phages on B and 4 on K. Wait, no\u2014the 40 plumes are on B, and 4 on K. So total plumes are 44, but each well has ~10^7 plating events, so over 10^7 wells, the total number of plumes would be 44 * 10^7. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to infect strain B than strain K. But lysogenic phages shouldn't be bad, so this doesn't make sense unless the phages are integrated into the T_4 genome, making them non-lytic. Wait, but lysogenic phages don't lyse the host, so they shouldn't be bad. Unless the phages are disrupting the host's ability to replicate, which is unlikely. I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find a simpler approach. The question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination occurs when two mutations are present in the same phage. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would cause interference, reducing the number of successful infections. The experiment showed that when both mutations are present, the E. coli strain B shows more resistance (40 plumes) than strain K (4 plumes). Assuming that the lysogenic phage is working better, perhaps it's due to recombination. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would reduce the number of successful infections. However, in reality, lysogenic phages are supposed to replicate inside the host without affecting its own replication. So maybe the issue is that the lysogenic phage is not compatible with the other mutation. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the other phage to replicate without disruption, but the lysogenic phage itself isn't bad. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or a known approach. From what I remember, the number of recombinant plasmids (R) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total number of plasmids)\n\nBut I also know that under complete incompatibility, R = 0. If there are some recombinants, it indicates incomplete incompatibility. The fraction of recombinant plasmids (fR) is given by:\n\nfR = (R / N) * 100%\n\nwhere N is the total number of plating events.\n\nIn this experiment, the total number of plating events in each half is 10^7 (from the 1:10^7 dilution) plus 10^5 (from the 1:10^5 dilution), totaling 10^7 + 10^5 \u2248 10^7 plating events. \n\nNow, the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. So the total number of plumes across both halves is 40 + 4 = 44. However, each half has 10^7 plating events, so the actual number of plumes would be proportional to the number of plating events. Therefore, the proportion of plumes on B relative to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective on B than on K, implying that the lysogenic phage has some mechanism that favors its attachment to B. However, lysogenic phages are supposed to replicate inside the host and do not lyse it. So perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage allows the non-lytic phage to replicate without disruption, but the lysogenic phage itself is not effective when interacting with the other mutation. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently. If the two mutations are in the same phage, the presence of both would lead to reduced efficiency, resulting in fewer plumes. But in this case, B has more plumes than K, indicating that the lysogenic phage is more effective on B. Perhaps the lysogenic phage is effective when the other mutation is non-lytic, but in this case, it's causing issues. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is not effective because it's integrating into the T_4 genome, making it non-lytic. If that's the case, then when the lysogenic phage is present along with a non-lytic phage, the lysogenic phage wouldn't cause issues, but in this experiment, it does. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " In lytic fission phages, the phage DNA integrates into the bacterial genome, leading to prophage release. In lysogenic phages, the phage DNA is expressed as a protein, and the phage stays inside the host. So if there's a mutation in both regions, perhaps they cause cross-infection. But wait, the problem says the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, meaning it's not causing lytic fission, but it might be causing lysogenic fission regardless. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to some recombination where their effects combine. \n\nIn the experiment, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B shows a saturation divided into two equal parts. Then each part is further diluted and plated. On strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, there are 4 plumes. Wait, no\u2014probably it's the opposite: 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me read again: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K.\" So the first half was on B's lawn, and the second on K's. They observed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the K lawn had fewer plumes than the B lawn, implying that the strain K's phage population was higher relative to the phage concentration on each lawn. Because the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. So if the strain K is being plated at a higher density, the phages would infect more cells, resulting in more plumes.\n\nNow, considering the two mutant types: one causes lytic fission (so the phage dies upon replication), and the other causes lysogenic fission (the phage remains inside the host). If a strain has both mutation types, perhaps they compete for the same sites, leading to interference in each other's replication. However, the key point here is that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, so any phages that replicate without lysogenic activity could potentially lyse the cells. But wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; instead, it just lives longer. So maybe the presence of both mutants allows for some cross-inhibition, preventing either type from completely dominating. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage's genome and interfere with the replication of the lytic phage.\n\nBut going back to the experiment: when both mutants are present, the effect is that the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage might be interfering with the lytic phage. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse strain B) competes with the lytic phage (which does lyse strain B), leading to reduced expression of the lytic phage in strain B. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain B would decrease compared to the case where only the lysogenic phage is present.\n\nWait, but in our case, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected, which aligns with the idea that the lysogenic phage is causing some lysis despite its inability to do so itself. So the presence of the lysogenic phage may lead to some competition, causing less lytic phage to be present in strain B. Thus, the number of plumes on strain B decreases. Similarly, the lysogenic phage should be unaffected by strain B's presence because it doesn't lyse strain B.\n\nSo now, to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the ability of different genetic elements to exchange their DNA sequences, often mediated by recombination proteins like RecA. In the context of phages, this would involve the integration of the two mutant types into the phage's genome, allowing them to interfere with each other's replication.\n\nWhen two mutations occur in the same phage, their recombination frequency indicates how often their sites are integrated into the phage's genome. If they are tightly linked (high recombination), their sites are close together. If they are far apart, their sites are farther apart.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutant types leads to reduced expression of the lytic phage in strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is interfering with the lytic phage. This implies that the two mutations are interfering, which could be due to their integration into the same phage. However, the actual calculation of recombination frequency typically requires knowing the exact locations of the mutations within the phage's genome. Since we don't have that information, perhaps we're supposed to use the data provided to estimate it.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the number of plumes can indicate the strength of interference. For example, if the lysogenic phage is causing some lysis in strain B, then the lysogenic phage must be integrating into the phage's genome, thereby interfering with the lytic phage. The level of interference depends on the recombination between the two mutations. Higher recombination frequencies (more tight linkage) would result in more interference, thus affecting the number of plumes observed.\n\nGiven that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes on strain B decreased significantly (from whatever it was without both mutants down to 4), while the number on strain K remained relatively high (40 vs. presumably higher without both mutants), this suggests that the lysogenic phage (which lacks recombination) is surviving better in strain K, while the lysogenic phage is affected in strain B.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, we can consider the ratio of plumes on each strain. The expected number of plumes on strain K would depend on the likelihood of the lysogenic phage successfully replicating without recombination. If the recombination frequency is high, the lysogenic phage is more likely to remain intact, leading to more plumes on strain K. Conversely, if the recombination is low, the lysogenic phage integrates closely with the phage DNA, making it harder for the lysogenic phage to replicate independently, thus reducing the number of plumes on strain K.\n\nIn our case, the number of plumes on strain K increased from whatever it was in the absence of both mutants to 4, while on strain B it decreased from whatever it was in the absence to 40. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective in replicating in strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage is not subject to significant interference in strain K but is more susceptible in strain B. This difference is probably due to the location of the mutations in the phage's genome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage's genome, making it more effective in replicating in strain B where it can interfere with the lytic phage. Conversely, in strain K, the lysogenic phage might not have such strong interference because the mutations are further apart, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively without being disrupted.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of Independent Replicons / Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nWhere independent replications refer to the lysogenic phage replicating without the influence of the lysogenic mutation. However, without specific data on the number of independent replicons, this approach might not be feasible. Instead, we can look at the difference in plume counts between the two strains to infer the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a certain probability of remaining intact after integrating into the phage's genome, the number of plumes on each strain can give us an indication of how much interference occurred. If the lysogenic phage integrates closely with the phage DNA, it can replicate more effectively, leading to fewer plumes on strain K and more on strain B. Conversely, if the integration is more extensive, the lysogenic phage would replicate more effectively in both strains, but the difference would be smaller.\n\nGiven that strain B experienced a reduction in plumes (from X to 4), and strain K saw an increase (from X to 40), the differential plume count suggests that the lysogenic phage is more susceptible in strain B due to the proximity of the mutations. This proximity would imply a high recombination frequency, meaning that the mutations are tightly integrated into the phage's genome, making them more effective in interfering with each other.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can assume that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome at a rate determined by the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is very high, the lysogenic phage's integration is near the phage's own DNA, making it more effective in replicating. The number of plumes would reflect the degree of integration. However, without specific data on the number of plumes caused by each mutation alone, this becomes challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the difference in plume numbers is 40-4=36 on strain B, and assuming similar differences elsewhere, the recombination frequency might relate inversely to the number of plumes. However, this line of reasoning isn't straightforward without additional data.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, they range from 0.05% to 0.5%. These represent very low percentages, indicating a very tight linkage between the two mutations. High recombination frequencies correspond to small plume differences because the mutations are tightly integrated, making it easier for the lysogenic phage to replicate without disrupting the host.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is more effective in replicating in strain B, the mutations must be tightly integrated, suggesting a high recombination frequency. Among the options, the highest percentage is 5%, followed by 2%, etc. However, 0.05% is extremely low, and given that even moderate recombination frequencies can lead to noticeable plume changes, perhaps 1% or 2% is more plausible.\n\nConsidering the experimental results, where strain B showed a significant reduction in plumes (from X to 4), and strain K saw an increase (X to 40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more vulnerable to interference in strain B. This indicates that the mutations are tightly integrated, leading to a high recombination frequency. Between the options, 1% seems too high, and 2% is still quite high. The next option is 0.5%, which is lower. However, the numbers suggest that the recombination is relatively subtle but not entirely absent. Therefore, 0.5% might be the closest.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that a high recombination frequency leads to significant plume differences. Given that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness varies depending on integration, perhaps a recombination frequency around 1% would explain the observed plume changes. Alternatively, 0.5% could also make sense, but 0.02% and 0.05% are extremely low, suggesting almost complete non-integration.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the most reasonable conclusion is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.02% (option J) or 0.05% (option E). However, 0.05% is slightly higher than 0.02%, and considering that 1% is quite common, perhaps 0.05% is more accurate. Alternatively, since the difference in plumes is 36 on strain B, and assuming that each unit of recombination contributes a certain number of plumes, perhaps the calculation leads to 0.05%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it is that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of independent replicons. If the lysogenic phage has a certain probability of replicating independently, the number of plumes reflects that. For instance, if the lysogenic phage integrates closely, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if it integrates widely, replication is less efficient, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf we consider that the lysogenic phage replicated 4 times more in strain K than in strain B, perhaps this relates to the recombination frequency. But without a clear mathematical relationship, it's hard to pin down the exact value. However, based on the options, 0.05% seems low, whereas 0.02% and 0.05% are both possible, with 0.05% being slightly higher. Given the experimental results, I think 0.05% might be the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In lytic fission phages, the phage DNA integrates into the bacterial genome, leading to prophage release. In lysogenic phages, the phage DNA is expressed as a protein, and the phage stays inside the host. So if there's a mutation in both regions, perhaps they cause cross-infection. But wait, the problem says the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, meaning it's not causing lytic fission, but it might be causing lysogenic fission regardless. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants leads to some recombination where their effects combine. \n\nIn the experiment, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B shows a saturation divided into two equal parts. Then each part is further diluted and plated. On strain B's lawn, there are 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, there are 4 plumes. Wait, no\u2014probably it's the opposite: 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me read again: \"The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K.\" So the first half was on B's lawn, and the second on K's. They observed 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the K lawn had fewer plumes than the B lawn, implying that the strain K's phage population was higher relative to the phage concentration on each lawn. Because the number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. So if the strain K is being plated at a higher density, the phages would infect more cells, resulting in more plumes.\n\nNow, considering the two mutant types: one causes lytic fission (so the phage dies upon replication), and the other causes lysogenic fission (the phage remains inside the host). If a strain has both mutation types, perhaps they compete for the same sites, leading to interference in each other's replication. However, the key point here is that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, so any phages that replicate without lysogenic activity could potentially lyse the cells. But wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse; instead, it just lives longer. So maybe the presence of both mutants allows for some cross-inhibition, preventing either type from completely dominating. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage's genome and interfere with the replication of the lytic phage.\n\nBut going back to the experiment: when both mutants are present, the effect is that the E. coli strain B is mostly affected. This suggests that the lysogenic phage might be interfering with the lytic phage. So when both types are present, the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse strain B) competes with the lytic phage (which does lyse strain B), leading to reduced expression of the lytic phage in strain B. Therefore, the number of plumes on strain B would decrease compared to the case where only the lysogenic phage is present.\n\nWait, but in our case, when both mutant types are present, the E. coli strain B is primarily affected, which aligns with the idea that the lysogenic phage is causing some lysis despite its inability to do so itself. So the presence of the lysogenic phage may lead to some competition, causing less lytic phage to be present in strain B. Thus, the number of plumes on strain B decreases. Similarly, the lysogenic phage should be unaffected by strain B's presence because it doesn't lyse strain B.\n\nSo now, to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the ability of different genetic elements to exchange their DNA sequences, often mediated by recombination proteins like RecA. In the context of phages, this would involve the integration of the two mutant types into the phage's genome, allowing them to interfere with each other's replication.\n\nWhen two mutations occur in the same phage, their recombination frequency indicates how often their sites are integrated into the phage's genome. If they are tightly linked (high recombination), their sites are close together. If they are far apart, their sites are farther apart.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of both mutant types leads to reduced expression of the lytic phage in strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is interfering with the lytic phage. This implies that the two mutations are interfering, which could be due to their integration into the same phage. However, the actual calculation of recombination frequency typically requires knowing the exact locations of the mutations within the phage's genome. Since we don't have that information, perhaps we're supposed to use the data provided to estimate it.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that the number of plumes can indicate the strength of interference. For example, if the lysogenic phage is causing some lysis in strain B, then the lysogenic phage must be integrating into the phage's genome, thereby interfering with the lytic phage. The level of interference depends on the recombination between the two mutations. Higher recombination frequencies (more tight linkage) would result in more interference, thus affecting the number of plumes observed.\n\nGiven that when both mutants are present, the number of plumes on strain B decreased significantly (from whatever it was without both mutants down to 4), while the number on strain K remained relatively high (40 vs. presumably higher without both mutants), this suggests that the lysogenic phage (which lacks recombination) is surviving better in strain K, while the lysogenic phage is affected in strain B.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, we can consider the ratio of plumes on each strain. The expected number of plumes on strain K would depend on the likelihood of the lysogenic phage successfully replicating without recombination. If the recombination frequency is high, the lysogenic phage is more likely to remain intact, leading to more plumes on strain K. Conversely, if the recombination is low, the lysogenic phage integrates closely with the phage DNA, making it harder for the lysogenic phage to replicate independently, thus reducing the number of plumes on strain K.\n\nIn our case, the number of plumes on strain K increased from whatever it was in the absence of both mutants to 4, while on strain B it decreased from whatever it was in the absence to 40. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective in replicating in strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage is not subject to significant interference in strain K but is more susceptible in strain B. This difference is probably due to the location of the mutations in the phage's genome. If the two mutations are tightly linked, the lysogenic phage can integrate into the phage's genome, making it more effective in replicating in strain B where it can interfere with the lytic phage. Conversely, in strain K, the lysogenic phage might not have such strong interference because the mutations are further apart, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate more effectively without being disrupted.\n\nThe recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of Independent Replicons / Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nWhere independent replications refer to the lysogenic phage replicating without the influence of the lysogenic mutation. However, without specific data on the number of independent replicons, this approach might not be feasible. Instead, we can look at the difference in plume counts between the two strains to infer the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage has a certain probability of remaining intact after integrating into the phage's genome, the number of plumes on each strain can give us an indication of how much interference occurred. If the lysogenic phage integrates closely with the phage DNA, it can replicate more effectively, leading to fewer plumes on strain K and more on strain B. Conversely, if the integration is more extensive, the lysogenic phage would replicate more effectively in both strains, but the difference would be smaller.\n\nGiven that strain B experienced a reduction in plumes (from X to 4), and strain K saw an increase (from X to 40), the differential plume count suggests that the lysogenic phage is more susceptible in strain B due to the proximity of the mutations. This proximity would imply a high recombination frequency, meaning that the mutations are tightly integrated into the phage's genome, making them more effective in interfering with each other.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can assume that the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome at a rate determined by the recombination frequency. If the recombination frequency is very high, the lysogenic phage's integration is near the phage's own DNA, making it more effective in replicating. The number of plumes would reflect the degree of integration. However, without specific data on the number of plumes caused by each mutation alone, this becomes challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the difference in plume numbers is 40-4=36 on strain B, and assuming similar differences elsewhere, the recombination frequency might relate inversely to the number of plumes. However, this line of reasoning isn't straightforward without additional data.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, they range from 0.05% to 0.5%. These represent very low percentages, indicating a very tight linkage between the two mutations. High recombination frequencies correspond to small plume differences because the mutations are tightly integrated, making it easier for the lysogenic phage to replicate without disrupting the host.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage is more effective in replicating in strain B, the mutations must be tightly integrated, suggesting a high recombination frequency. Among the options, the highest percentage is 5%, followed by 2%, etc. However, 0.05% is extremely low, and given that even moderate recombination frequencies can lead to noticeable plume changes, perhaps 1% or 2% is more plausible.\n\nConsidering the experimental results, where strain B showed a significant reduction in plumes (from X to 4), and strain K saw an increase (X to 40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage is more vulnerable to interference in strain B. This indicates that the mutations are tightly integrated, leading to a high recombination frequency. Between the options, 1% seems too high, and 2% is still quite high. The next option is 0.5%, which is lower. However, the numbers suggest that the recombination is relatively subtle but not entirely absent. Therefore, 0.5% might be the closest.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that a high recombination frequency leads to significant plume differences. Given that the lysogenic phage's effectiveness varies depending on integration, perhaps a recombination frequency around 1% would explain the observed plume changes. Alternatively, 0.5% could also make sense, but 0.02% and 0.05% are extremely low, suggesting almost complete non-integration.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the most reasonable conclusion is that the recombination frequency is approximately 0.02% (option J) or 0.05% (option E). However, 0.05% is slightly higher than 0.02%, and considering that 1% is quite common, perhaps 0.05% is more accurate. Alternatively, since the difference in plumes is 36 on strain B, and assuming that each unit of recombination contributes a certain number of plumes, perhaps the calculation leads to 0.05%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it is that the number of plumes is proportional to the number of independent replicons. If the lysogenic phage has a certain probability of replicating independently, the number of plumes reflects that. For instance, if the lysogenic phage integrates closely, it might replicate more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. Conversely, if it integrates widely, replication is less efficient, leading to more plumes.\n\nIf we consider that the lysogenic phage replicated 4 times more in strain K than in strain B, perhaps this relates to the recombination frequency. But without a clear mathematical relationship, it's hard to pin down the exact value. However, based on the options, 0.05% seems low, whereas 0.02% and 0.05% are both possible, with 0.05% being slightly higher. Given the experimental results, I think 0.05% might be the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " The key here is the recombination, which would affect whether the mutations interfere or help each other. Recombination typically occurs during replication when different regions exchange genetic material. In this case, the two mutations are in different regions of the T_4 phage genome\u2014probably in the coding regions where they can interact. If they recombine, their effects might be additive instead of opposing. Now, looking at the results: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, while on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found. Since the phages from strain B were more likely to cause infection (because they're on strain B's lawn), this indicates that the phages from strain K had a lower chance of infecting strain B, suggesting that the phages from strain K didn't find enough susceptible cells. Alternatively, if they recombined, maybe the combined effect was less harmful than expected. However, wait, the problem states that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is \"lysed\" (i.e., killed) but not strain K. That's confusing. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants affects the phage's ability to replicate or integrate. Anyway, moving on. The main point is the recombination rate. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect some interference, but if they recombine, the interference might change. In the experiment, the number of plumes on strain K's lawn (4) is much lower than on B's (40). This suggests that the phages on strain K were less effective against strain B, implying that the phages on strain K either had a lower fitness in strain B's environment or perhaps their mutation wasn't as disruptive. But why? Wait, no\u2014the phages on strain K would have different mutation rates. If the mutations are recombining, then the phage carrying one mutation may have a different fitness in another strain. Alternatively, if the mutations are in the same gene, they wouldn't recombine. Hmm, but the question says the two mutantphages have different mutations, presumably in separate regions. So recombination would occur when the two regions exchange genetic material. The number of plumes depends on the frequency of successful infections. If there's recombination, the phages that carry one mutation might still be able to infect cells carrying the other mutation. Wait, but in this context, perhaps the phages' ability to infect is dependent on their own mutations. If the two mutations are in separate genes, recombination would allow them to exist together in a single phage. Therefore, the total number of phages would increase, leading to more infections. However, in the experiment, the presence of both mutants increased the likelihood of infection in one strain more than the other. Wait, but the results showed that strain B had more plumes, meaning more infections, while strain K had fewer. Or did I get that wrong? No, the phages on strain K have a lower chance of causing lytic fission, so more plumes on strain B, less on K. But why? Unless the phages on strain K are somehow less fit in strain B's environment, making them less likely to infect. Alternatively, the combination of mutations could lead to reduced effectiveness. But perhaps I should focus on the recombination calculation. The formula for recombination frequency is often given as r = -ln(1 - p), where p is the observed probability of recombination. But in this scenario, we have multiple plasmid counts. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinant events based on the observed data. For example, if the two mutations are on different chromosomes, the probability of recombination is the fraction of double crossovers, which can be calculated using the observed ratios. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes relates to the number of double recombinations. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. The coefficient of coincidence (COC) is the ratio of observed double recombinants over the expected number if the genes were independently distributed. The formula is COC = (number of observed double recombinants) / (expected number if independent). Expected number is (p1 * p2) * N, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and N is the total number of phages. But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps I can estimate the COC. Given the high dilution factors, the phage concentrations are low, so the chance of double recombinants is very small. Alternatively, the observed number of double recombinants would be much lower than expected, indicating a low COC, meaning little recombination. Alternatively, the number of plumes on each strain could indicate the proportion of double recombinants. Let me try to model this. Suppose that during the experiment, the two mutantphages produce recombinant versions. Each phage has a certain probability of being recombinant. The total number of recombinant phages would depend on the product of the probabilities. If the recombination rate is r, then the expected number of recombinant phages would be 2rN, assuming each crossing over contributes two recombinant phages. But in this case, the results show that strain B has more plumes, which implies that strain B had more infections. Since the strain K's plumes are fewer, perhaps the strain K's phages have a lower mutation rate, or the recombination occurred more frequently in strain B. Wait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So if the mutations are located on different chromosomes, the probability of recombination is the recombination frequency. To calculate this, we can look at the number of recombinant phages versus the total number. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COC) is:\n\nCOC = observed double recombinants / (expected if independent)\n\nThe expected number of double recombinants is p1 * p2 * N_total, where p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation. However, without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps we can infer the COC from the plume numbers. Alternatively, the number of double recombinants would correspond to the number of plumes divided by the total number of phages. Wait, but the plumes are a measure of the number of infections, which depends on the number of phages and their efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of plumes gives us the ratio of recombination events. For instance, if the number of double recombinants is proportional to the square of the recombination rate, then the ratio of plumes could give us the square of the COC. Let me consider an example. Suppose the COC is x, then the ratio of double recombinants would be x\u00b2. If the observed ratio is higher than expected, it suggests that the mutations are linked, but if it's lower, it suggests more independence. However, in this case, the strain B has more plumes, suggesting more double recombinants relative to the expected. Wait, but if the mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected number of double recombinants would be minimal, whereas if they were on the same chromosome, there would be more. But since the question specifies two different mutations, they're likely on different chromosomes. Therefore, the observed number of double recombinants would be lower than expected, indicating low COC, meaning little recombination. But the question is asking for the recombination between the two mutations, so even a tiny amount would imply significant interference. Alternatively, perhaps the observed plume count reflects the number of double recombinants, and thus we can compute the COC. Let's assume that the COC is equal to the observed number of double recombinants divided by the expected. Suppose that in the experiment, the total number of phages is N. Then the expected number of double recombinants is (p1 * p2) * N. But without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps we can estimate it from the plume counts. Alternatively, since the problem provides four plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B, perhaps the number of double recombinants is related to the difference in plume counts. Wait, but the phages from strain K were diluted more, so their chance of infecting strain B was lower. So the number of double recombinants would be proportional to the product of their concentrations. Perhaps the number of double recombinants is (4 * 40) / (1e5 * 1e7) ) = (160)/(1e12) = 1.6e-10. That seems too small. Alternatively, perhaps the number of double recombinants is proportional to the product of the plume counts. If the plumes on K are 4 and on B are 40, then 4*40=160. The total number of phages is N = 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. So the expected double recombinants would be (r)^2 * N. We can set 160 = r\u00b2 * 1e7 \u2192 r\u00b2 = 160 / 1e7 \u2248 1.6e-5 \u2192 r\u2248sqrt(1.6e-5)= ~0.0126 or 1.26%. So that would translate to approximately 1.26% recombination. Looking back at the options, option C is 1.5%, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again: plume counts on K:4, on B:40. Total phage concentration: 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. Double recombinants: 4*40=160. Assuming the expected number of double recombinants is r\u00b2*N, where N is the total phages. So 160 = r\u00b2*(1.0001e7). Solving for r: r\u00b2=160/(1.0001e7)=approx 1.5998e-5 \u2192 r\u2248sqrt(1.5998e-5)= approx 0.01265 or 1.265%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 1.27%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or perhaps none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the actual dilutions differently. Wait, the dilution factors are 1:1e5 and 1:1e7, so the total volume is 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. The number of phages is proportional to the dilution factor. The number of phages on strain K is 4/1e5 = 4e-5 phage units, and on B it's 40/1e7=4e-6 phage units. The product is (4e-5)*(4e-6)=1.6e-10. The total phage units squared would be (4e-5 + 4e-6)^2 = (4.4e-5)^2=1.936e-9. So the COC is (1.6e-10)/(1.936e-9)= approx 0.0825, or 8.25%. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the number of double recombinants is the product of the plume counts, divided by the product of the dilutions. So (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected number is r\u00b2*(1e7), so r\u00b2=1.6e-10 /1e7=1.6e-17 \u2192 r\u22484.0e-9. That's 0.000004%, which is negligible. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which is:\n\nCOC = (observed double recombinants) / (expected if independent)\n\nExpected if independent is p1*p2*N, where N is the total number of phages. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of double recombinants would be p1*p2*N. Without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps it's better to express COC in terms of the observed ratio. Alternatively, the number of double recombinants is (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected if independent is (p1*p2)*N, where N=1e7+1e5\u22481.0001e7. If p1 and p2 are the fractions of each mutation in the population, say p1=0.01 and p2=0.01, then expected double recombinants=0.01*0.01*1e7=1e3. But our observed is 1.6e-10, which is way smaller. So perhaps the mutations are linked, meaning that p1=p2=r, so expected double recombinants=r\u00b2*N. Setting 1.6e-10=r\u00b2*1e7 \u2192 r\u00b2=1.6e-17 \u2192 r\u22484.0e-9, which is 0.000004%, almost zero. That suggests no recombination, which conflicts with the initial assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Wait, the problem mentions that the two mutantphages carry different mutations in the same T_4 genome. So they must be on different chromosomes. Thus, the COC would be r\u00b2*(N1+N2), where N1 and N2 are the concentrations of each mutation. Wait, but the COC formula is COC = observed double / expected independent. So if the mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected double recombinants is r\u00b2*N, where N is the total number of phages. But without knowing r, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence based on the observed number of double recombinants. Since the observed number of double recombinants is 4*40/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected under independent assortment is (p1*p2)*(N), where N is the total phages, which is 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. If we assume that p1 and p2 are such that p1 = p2 = r, then expected double recombinants = r\u00b2 * 1.0001e7. Setting this equal to 1.6e-10, we get r\u00b2 = 1.6e-10 / 1.0001e7 \u2248 1.5998e-17 \u2192 r\u22481.265e-8 or 0.000001265%, which is effectively zero. That suggests no recombination, which doesn't align with any of the provided options except possibly F or G, but those are around 0.3% or 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a simplified approach. Let's consider that the number of double recombinants is the product of the plume counts divided by the product of the dilutions. So (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected number under independent assortment is p1*p2*(1e7 + 1e5)\u2248 p1*p2*1e7. If p1 and p2 are the fractions of each mutation, say p1=0.01 and p2=0.01, then expected double recombinants=0.01*0.01*1e7=1e3. But our observed is 1.6e-10, which is way smaller. Therefore, the mutations are highly associated, i.e., r is large. Using the formula COC = (observed)/expected, and setting observed=4*40/(1e5*1e7)=1.6e-10, and expected= (0.01*0.01)*1e7=1e3. Then COC=1.6e-10 /1e3=1.6e-13, which is practically zero. This suggests that the mutations are not recombining, which contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used assumes that the two mutations are on the same chromosome, but the question specifies they are in the same T_4 genome, implying different chromosomes. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect that the recombination rate is low, but none of the options go below 0.1%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the setup. Let me try another approach. The problem states that when both mutantphages are present, E. coli strain B is affected (lysed), and strain K has fewer plumes. This suggests that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of E. coli being lysed. If the mutations were linked, having both would reduce the risk of lysing. Alternatively, if they were independent, having both would increase the risk. So in this case, since E. coli strain B has more plumes (more infections), the mutations must be interacting in a way that reduces the risk. This suggests that they are linked (recombinant), thereby reducing the chance of double infections. Therefore, the coefficient of coincidence would be high, meaning a low recombination rate. To calculate the COC, we can use the formula:\n\nCOC = observed / expected\n\nWhere observed is the number of double recombinants, and expected is the number of double recombinants if the mutations were independent. If the observed number of double recombinants is greater than expected, it suggests less recombination; if less, more recombination. From the experiment, the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. Assuming that the mutations are linked, the number of double recombinants would be higher than expected. Conversely, if they were independent, the number would be lower. Calculating the expected number of double recombinants when mutations are independent:\n\nTotal phages on B: 4/1e5 = 4e-5\nTotal phages on K: 40/1e7 = 4e-6\nTotal phages: 4e-5 + 4e-6 = 4.4e-5\nExpected double recombinants: (4e-5) * (4e-6) * (4.4e-5)^2 \u2248 1.6e-10\n\nObserved double recombin",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The key here is the recombination, which would affect whether the mutations interfere or help each other. Recombination typically occurs during replication when different regions exchange genetic material. In this case, the two mutations are in different regions of the T_4 phage genome\u2014probably in the coding regions where they can interact. If they recombine, their effects might be additive instead of opposing. Now, looking at the results: On strain B's lawn, 40 plumes were found, while on strain K's lawn, 4 plumes were found. Since the phages from strain B were more likely to cause infection (because they're on strain B's lawn), this indicates that the phages from strain K had a lower chance of infecting strain B, suggesting that the phages from strain K didn't find enough susceptible cells. Alternatively, if they recombined, maybe the combined effect was less harmful than expected. However, wait, the problem states that when both mutants are present, the E. coli strain B is \"lysed\" (i.e., killed) but not strain K. That's confusing. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants affects the phage's ability to replicate or integrate. Anyway, moving on. The main point is the recombination rate. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect some interference, but if they recombine, the interference might change. In the experiment, the number of plumes on strain K's lawn (4) is much lower than on B's (40). This suggests that the phages on strain K were less effective against strain B, implying that the phages on strain K either had a lower fitness in strain B's environment or perhaps their mutation wasn't as disruptive. But why? Wait, no\u2014the phages on strain K would have different mutation rates. If the mutations are recombining, then the phage carrying one mutation may have a different fitness in another strain. Alternatively, if the mutations are in the same gene, they wouldn't recombine. Hmm, but the question says the two mutantphages have different mutations, presumably in separate regions. So recombination would occur when the two regions exchange genetic material. The number of plumes depends on the frequency of successful infections. If there's recombination, the phages that carry one mutation might still be able to infect cells carrying the other mutation. Wait, but in this context, perhaps the phages' ability to infect is dependent on their own mutations. If the two mutations are in separate genes, recombination would allow them to exist together in a single phage. Therefore, the total number of phages would increase, leading to more infections. However, in the experiment, the presence of both mutants increased the likelihood of infection in one strain more than the other. Wait, but the results showed that strain B had more plumes, meaning more infections, while strain K had fewer. Or did I get that wrong? No, the phages on strain K have a lower chance of causing lytic fission, so more plumes on strain B, less on K. But why? Unless the phages on strain K are somehow less fit in strain B's environment, making them less likely to infect. Alternatively, the combination of mutations could lead to reduced effectiveness. But perhaps I should focus on the recombination calculation. The formula for recombination frequency is often given as r = -ln(1 - p), where p is the observed probability of recombination. But in this scenario, we have multiple plasmid counts. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinant events based on the observed data. For example, if the two mutations are on different chromosomes, the probability of recombination is the fraction of double crossovers, which can be calculated using the observed ratios. Alternatively, considering that the number of plumes relates to the number of double recombinations. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence. The coefficient of coincidence (COC) is the ratio of observed double recombinants over the expected number if the genes were independently distributed. The formula is COC = (number of observed double recombinants) / (expected number if independent). Expected number is (p1 * p2) * N, where p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and N is the total number of phages. But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps I can estimate the COC. Given the high dilution factors, the phage concentrations are low, so the chance of double recombinants is very small. Alternatively, the observed number of double recombinants would be much lower than expected, indicating a low COC, meaning little recombination. Alternatively, the number of plumes on each strain could indicate the proportion of double recombinants. Let me try to model this. Suppose that during the experiment, the two mutantphages produce recombinant versions. Each phage has a certain probability of being recombinant. The total number of recombinant phages would depend on the product of the probabilities. If the recombination rate is r, then the expected number of recombinant phages would be 2rN, assuming each crossing over contributes two recombinant phages. But in this case, the results show that strain B has more plumes, which implies that strain B had more infections. Since the strain K's plumes are fewer, perhaps the strain K's phages have a lower mutation rate, or the recombination occurred more frequently in strain B. Wait, but the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So if the mutations are located on different chromosomes, the probability of recombination is the recombination frequency. To calculate this, we can look at the number of recombinant phages versus the total number. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COC) is:\n\nCOC = observed double recombinants / (expected if independent)\n\nThe expected number of double recombinants is p1 * p2 * N_total, where p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation. However, without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps we can infer the COC from the plume numbers. Alternatively, the number of double recombinants would correspond to the number of plumes divided by the total number of phages. Wait, but the plumes are a measure of the number of infections, which depends on the number of phages and their efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of plumes gives us the ratio of recombination events. For instance, if the number of double recombinants is proportional to the square of the recombination rate, then the ratio of plumes could give us the square of the COC. Let me consider an example. Suppose the COC is x, then the ratio of double recombinants would be x\u00b2. If the observed ratio is higher than expected, it suggests that the mutations are linked, but if it's lower, it suggests more independence. However, in this case, the strain B has more plumes, suggesting more double recombinants relative to the expected. Wait, but if the mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected number of double recombinants would be minimal, whereas if they were on the same chromosome, there would be more. But since the question specifies two different mutations, they're likely on different chromosomes. Therefore, the observed number of double recombinants would be lower than expected, indicating low COC, meaning little recombination. But the question is asking for the recombination between the two mutations, so even a tiny amount would imply significant interference. Alternatively, perhaps the observed plume count reflects the number of double recombinants, and thus we can compute the COC. Let's assume that the COC is equal to the observed number of double recombinants divided by the expected. Suppose that in the experiment, the total number of phages is N. Then the expected number of double recombinants is (p1 * p2) * N. But without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps we can estimate it from the plume counts. Alternatively, since the problem provides four plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B, perhaps the number of double recombinants is related to the difference in plume counts. Wait, but the phages from strain K were diluted more, so their chance of infecting strain B was lower. So the number of double recombinants would be proportional to the product of their concentrations. Perhaps the number of double recombinants is (4 * 40) / (1e5 * 1e7) ) = (160)/(1e12) = 1.6e-10. That seems too small. Alternatively, perhaps the number of double recombinants is proportional to the product of the plume counts. If the plumes on K are 4 and on B are 40, then 4*40=160. The total number of phages is N = 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. So the expected double recombinants would be (r)^2 * N. We can set 160 = r\u00b2 * 1e7 \u2192 r\u00b2 = 160 / 1e7 \u2248 1.6e-5 \u2192 r\u2248sqrt(1.6e-5)= ~0.0126 or 1.26%. So that would translate to approximately 1.26% recombination. Looking back at the options, option C is 1.5%, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again: plume counts on K:4, on B:40. Total phage concentration: 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. Double recombinants: 4*40=160. Assuming the expected number of double recombinants is r\u00b2*N, where N is the total phages. So 160 = r\u00b2*(1.0001e7). Solving for r: r\u00b2=160/(1.0001e7)=approx 1.5998e-5 \u2192 r\u2248sqrt(1.5998e-5)= approx 0.01265 or 1.265%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 1.27%, which is closest to option C (1.5%) or perhaps none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the actual dilutions differently. Wait, the dilution factors are 1:1e5 and 1:1e7, so the total volume is 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. The number of phages is proportional to the dilution factor. The number of phages on strain K is 4/1e5 = 4e-5 phage units, and on B it's 40/1e7=4e-6 phage units. The product is (4e-5)*(4e-6)=1.6e-10. The total phage units squared would be (4e-5 + 4e-6)^2 = (4.4e-5)^2=1.936e-9. So the COC is (1.6e-10)/(1.936e-9)= approx 0.0825, or 8.25%. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the number of double recombinants is the product of the plume counts, divided by the product of the dilutions. So (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected number is r\u00b2*(1e7), so r\u00b2=1.6e-10 /1e7=1.6e-17 \u2192 r\u22484.0e-9. That's 0.000004%, which is negligible. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which is:\n\nCOC = (observed double recombinants) / (expected if independent)\n\nExpected if independent is p1*p2*N, where N is the total number of phages. If the mutations are independent, the expected number of double recombinants would be p1*p2*N. Without knowing p1 and p2, perhaps it's better to express COC in terms of the observed ratio. Alternatively, the number of double recombinants is (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected if independent is (p1*p2)*N, where N=1e7+1e5\u22481.0001e7. If p1 and p2 are the fractions of each mutation in the population, say p1=0.01 and p2=0.01, then expected double recombinants=0.01*0.01*1e7=1e3. But our observed is 1.6e-10, which is way smaller. So perhaps the mutations are linked, meaning that p1=p2=r, so expected double recombinants=r\u00b2*N. Setting 1.6e-10=r\u00b2*1e7 \u2192 r\u00b2=1.6e-17 \u2192 r\u22484.0e-9, which is 0.000004%, almost zero. That suggests no recombination, which conflicts with the initial assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Wait, the problem mentions that the two mutantphages carry different mutations in the same T_4 genome. So they must be on different chromosomes. Thus, the COC would be r\u00b2*(N1+N2), where N1 and N2 are the concentrations of each mutation. Wait, but the COC formula is COC = observed double / expected independent. So if the mutations are on different chromosomes, the expected double recombinants is r\u00b2*N, where N is the total number of phages. But without knowing r, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence based on the observed number of double recombinants. Since the observed number of double recombinants is 4*40/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected under independent assortment is (p1*p2)*(N), where N is the total phages, which is 1e5 + 1e7 = 1.0001e7. If we assume that p1 and p2 are such that p1 = p2 = r, then expected double recombinants = r\u00b2 * 1.0001e7. Setting this equal to 1.6e-10, we get r\u00b2 = 1.6e-10 / 1.0001e7 \u2248 1.5998e-17 \u2192 r\u22481.265e-8 or 0.000001265%, which is effectively zero. That suggests no recombination, which doesn't align with any of the provided options except possibly F or G, but those are around 0.3% or 0.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a simplified approach. Let's consider that the number of double recombinants is the product of the plume counts divided by the product of the dilutions. So (4*40)/(1e5*1e7)=160/(1e12)=1.6e-10. The expected number under independent assortment is p1*p2*(1e7 + 1e5)\u2248 p1*p2*1e7. If p1 and p2 are the fractions of each mutation, say p1=0.01 and p2=0.01, then expected double recombinants=0.01*0.01*1e7=1e3. But our observed is 1.6e-10, which is way smaller. Therefore, the mutations are highly associated, i.e., r is large. Using the formula COC = (observed)/expected, and setting observed=4*40/(1e5*1e7)=1.6e-10, and expected= (0.01*0.01)*1e7=1e3. Then COC=1.6e-10 /1e3=1.6e-13, which is practically zero. This suggests that the mutations are not recombining, which contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used assumes that the two mutations are on the same chromosome, but the question specifies they are in the same T_4 genome, implying different chromosomes. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect that the recombination rate is low, but none of the options go below 0.1%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the setup. Let me try another approach. The problem states that when both mutantphages are present, E. coli strain B is affected (lysed), and strain K has fewer plumes. This suggests that the presence of both mutants increases the likelihood of E. coli being lysed. If the mutations were linked, having both would reduce the risk of lysing. Alternatively, if they were independent, having both would increase the risk. So in this case, since E. coli strain B has more plumes (more infections), the mutations must be interacting in a way that reduces the risk. This suggests that they are linked (recombinant), thereby reducing the chance of double infections. Therefore, the coefficient of coincidence would be high, meaning a low recombination rate. To calculate the COC, we can use the formula:\n\nCOC = observed / expected\n\nWhere observed is the number of double recombinants, and expected is the number of double recombinants if the mutations were independent. If the observed number of double recombinants is greater than expected, it suggests less recombination; if less, more recombination. From the experiment, the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. Assuming that the mutations are linked, the number of double recombinants would be higher than expected. Conversely, if they were independent, the number would be lower. Calculating the expected number of double recombinants when mutations are independent:\n\nTotal phages on B: 4/1e5 = 4e-5\nTotal phages on K: 40/1e7 = 4e-6\nTotal phages: 4e-5 + 4e-6 = 4.4e-5\nExpected double recombinants: (4e-5) * (4e-6) * (4.4e-5)^2 \u2248 1.6e-10\n\nObserved double recombin",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "The fact that the E.",
    "rollout": " The fact that the E. coli strain B shows some activity despite both types being present might indicate some recombination or interaction where the presence of both mutations leads to a different outcome than either alone. In phage genetics, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different phages, often leading to new combinations that don't produce the same phenotype as either parent. In this case, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis on its own because it's designed to replicate inside the bacterium. However, when both types are present, perhaps their interactions allow for different outcomes. Now, the key part is determining the percentage recombination. The number of plumes observed depends on the combination of phages present. Since one half is plated at 1:1e7 and the other at 1:1e5, the dilution affects the probability of infection. The ratio of plumes can help determine the degree of recombination. If the two mutations recombine, the combined phage would be more likely to infect the bacteria compared to individual phages. The formula to calculate the expected number of plumes from a combination is (p1 * p2), assuming independent events. Here, p1 is the probability of infection by the first phage, and p2 is the same for the second. The observed plumes should reflect this product. Let me try to model this. Suppose the two mutations recombine completely. Then the combined phage has a certain fitness effect, say F. The expected number of plumes would depend on F. But without knowing F, I need another approach. Alternatively, the observed plumes can tell me about the ratio of recombination. For example, if there's no recombination, the two mutations act independently, so the probability of infection would be additive: p1 + p2 - p1*p2. But if there's complete recombination, then the probability becomes p1*p2. Given the results, we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Let's see: On strain B, 40 plumes. On strain K, 4. Assuming the total number of plumes is roughly proportional to the number of cells plated. Strain B was plated at 1:1e7, so each well has 1e7 cells. Strain K was plated at 1:1e5, so 1e5 cells per well. The total number of plumes would be approximately the sum of all cells plated multiplied by the probability of infection. For strain B, the total cells are 1e7 * N_wells, and the plumes are 40. Similarly, for strain K, 1e5 * N_wells gives 4 plumes. Hmm, but wait, the exact numbers depend on how many wells there are. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Instead, I'll look for a way to estimate the recombination frequency using the observed plumes. The idea is that the recombination rate determines the likelihood of combining the two mutations. If they recombine frequently, the combined phage is less fit, reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, if they don't recombine, the combined phage is as fit as possible, leading to more plumes. The formula for the expected number of plumes from a combination is (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the fractions of cells that die (or do not lyse) due to each mutation. Let's assume f1 is the fraction of cells that die when lysogenic phage is present, and f2 similarly for the lysogenic type. Without recombination, f_total = f1 + f2 - f1*f2. With recombination, f_total = f1*f2. The observed plumes can give us an equation to solve for f1 and f2. Alternatively, since both mutations are known to affect E. coli strain B differently, we can use the data provided to infer the recombination rate. The result showed that half the bacteria died, suggesting some disruption. The exact calculation requires setting up equations based on the plume counts. This seems complex, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Another approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. Since strain B had more plumes (4 vs. 40), the lysogenic phage must be more effective against strain B than strain K. That makes sense because if the lysogenic phage is more effective on B, it would lead to more infections. Now, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = 1 - (plume_B / total_plumes)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, considering the plume counts as probabilities, the observed plumes could represent the expected number under some model. Maybe it's better to think in terms of probabilities. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability that a randomly selected phage from strain B causes lysogeny (does not lyse the cell). Similarly, q for strain K. The combined probability of both happening would be p*q if there's no recombination. If there's complete recombination, the combined probability would be zero, meaning the phage is fully recombinative and thus highly likely to lyse the cell. However, in our case, both mutations are in the same phage, so recombination implies that they have swapped segments, making the phage potentially more effective. But given that the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse strain B, it suggests that even when combined, the phage remains effective on B. Wait, but if recombination occurred, the phage would have a different fitness profile. Let me clarify: the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse B, so recombination might not affect this. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recall that in experimental studies involving double mutants, the number of plumes indicates the degree of interaction between the two mutations. The formula used is often:\n\nPlume_count = (number_of_mutations_in_phage) \u00d7 (probability_of_infection)\n\nBut without knowing the exact mechanism, it's tricky. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the plume counts relative to the expected values. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the probabilities minus their product. If there's significant recombination, the product term is small, so the expected plumes increase. Given that the observed plumes on strain B are much higher (4 vs. 40), it suggests that the combined phage is less effective on B than either mutation individually. Therefore, recombination must have occurred, allowing the combined phage to be less effective on B. To quantify recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nrf = (plume_B / (plume_B + plume_K)) \u00d7 100%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, considering the plume counts as probabilities, perhaps rf is such that (1 - rf)^2 = (plume_B)/(total_plumes). But I'm not confident about this approach. Alternatively, using the fact that the plume count reflects the probability of the combined effect. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2. With recombination, it's p1*p2. From the data, if strain B has more plumes, it suggests that the combined phage is less effective on B than either mutation alone, implying recombination. Let's set up equations. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the combined probability would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2. With recombination, it's p1*p2. We know that on strain B, the observed plumes are 4, and on strain K, 40. Let's suppose that the total plumes are 100% for simplicity. The combined probability on B is 4/100 = 0.04, and on K, it's 40/100 = 0.40. We can set up equations:\n\nCase 1: No Recombination:\nCombined prob on B: p1 + p2 - p1*p2 = 0.04\nCombined prob on K: p1 + p2 - p1*p2 = 0.40 \u2192 Contradiction, since same value can't equal 0.04 and 0.40.\n\nCase 2: Recombination:\nCombined prob on B: p1*p2 = 0.04\nCombined prob on K: p1*p2 = 0.40 \u2192 Again, contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the setup is incorrect. Perhaps the plume counts are not percentages but actual counts. Let's reconsider. Let\u2019s denote the number of cells plated as C_B and C_K. C_B is the number of cells on strain B, which is 1e7 times the number on strain K (since it's plated at 1:1e7). So if we let N be the number of cells on strain K, then C_B = 1e7*N and C_K = N. Each cell plates a certain number of phages, say n. Then the total number of phages plated on B is 1e7*N*n, and on K is N*n. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages that successfully infect and lyse the cell. For strain B, the number of plumes is 4, and for K, it's 40. So:\n\nOn B: 4 = k * (n * (1e7*N*n - \u03b4))\nOn K: 40 = k * (n * (N*n - \u03b4))\n\nWhere \u03b4 accounts for the death of phages that did not lyse (assuming \u03b4 is negligible or similar for both). Ignoring \u03b4, we can write:\n\n4 \u2248 k * n * (1e7*N*n)\n40 \u2248 k * n * (N*n)\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n40 / 4 = (k * n * (N*n)) / (k * n * (1e7*N*n)) ) \u2192 10 = 1/(1e7) \u2192 10 = 1e-7, which is clearly impossible. Thus, my approach is flawed. Maybe instead, I should focus on the ratio of plumes between the two strains. The ratio of plumes on K to B is 40/4=10. If recombination occurs, this ratio increases because the combined phage is less effective. The formula relating recombination frequency (rf) to the ratio R is:\n\nR = (1 - rf)/[1 - rf*(1 - rf)] \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected ratio R without recombination is 1/[1 - rf]. If recombination increases the effectiveness, the ratio decreases. Let me test with rf=0%: R=1/1=1. As rf increases, R decreases. So if R is 10, which is high, that corresponds to a low rf. Solving for rf when R=10:\n\n10 = [1] / [1 - rf]\n\n\u2192 10(1 - rf) = 1\n\n\u2192 10 - 10rf = 1\n\n\u2192 9 = 10rf\n\n\u2192 rf=90%. That's too high. Maybe the formula isn't correct. Alternatively, R = (1 - rf)^2. If R=10, then sqrt(10)=3.16\u22481 - rf \u2192 rf\u2248-216%, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me look for a simpler way. The problem states that the recombination frequency is determined by the observed plumes. Since strain B has a much higher number of plumes, it suggests that the combined phage is more effective on B than on K, which is counterintuitive unless there's significant recombination. The exact calculation might involve solving for rf such that the expected plumes match the observed numbers. However, without precise formulas, it's challenging. Looking back at the options, the highest rf mentioned is 5%, which is quite high. But given the discrepancy, perhaps rf is around 2-3%. Among the options, D is 0.05%, E is 0.2%, F is 0.3%, etc. The closest realistic answer based on typical recombination frequencies might be around 2%, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, the correct answer is D, 0.05%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. The fact that the E. coli strain B shows some activity despite both types being present might indicate some recombination or interaction where the presence of both mutations leads to a different outcome than either alone.

The number of plumes observed depends on the combination of phages present. Since one half is plated at 1:1e7 and the other at 1:1e5, the dilution affects the probability of infection. The ratio of plumes can help determine the degree of recombination. If the two mutations recombine, the combined phage would be more likely to infect the bacteria compared to individual phages. The formula to calculate the expected number of plumes from a combination is (p1 * p2), assuming independent events. Here, p1 is the probability of infection by the first phage, and p2 is the same for the second. The observed plumes should reflect this product. Let me try to model this. Suppose the two mutations recombine completely. Then the combined phage has a certain fitness effect, say F. The expected number of plumes would depend on F. But without knowing F, I need another approach. Alternatively, the observed plumes can tell me about the ratio of recombination. For example, if there's no recombination, the two mutations act independently, so the probability of infection would be additive: p1 + p2 - p1*p2. But if there's complete recombination, then the probability becomes p1*p2. Given the results, we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Let's see: On strain B, 40 plumes. On strain K, 4. Assuming the total number of plumes is roughly proportional to the number of cells plated. Strain B was plated at 1:1e7, so each well has 1e7 cells. Strain K was plated at 1:1e5, so 1e5 cells per well. The total number of plumes would be approximately the sum of all cells plated multiplied by the probability of infection. For strain B, the total cells are 1e7 * N_wells, and the plumes are 40. Similarly, for strain K, 1e5 * N_wells gives 4 plumes. Hmm, but wait, the exact numbers depend on how many wells there are. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Instead, I'll look for a way to estimate the recombination frequency using the observed plumes. The idea is that the recombination rate determines the likelihood of combining the two mutations. If they recombine frequently, the combined phage is less fit, reducing the number of plumes. Conversely, if they don't recombine, the combined phage is as fit as possible, leading to more plumes. The formula for the expected number of plumes from a combination is (f1 * f2), where f1 and f2 are the fractions of cells that die (or do not lyse) due to each mutation. Let's assume f1 is the fraction of cells that die when lysogenic phage is present, and f2 similarly for the lysogenic type. Without recombination, f_total = f1 + f2 - f1*f2. With recombination, f_total = f1*f2. The observed plumes can give us an equation to solve for f1 and f2. Alternatively, since both mutations are known to affect E. coli strain B differently, we can use the data provided to infer the recombination rate. The result showed that half the bacteria died, suggesting some disruption. The exact calculation requires setting up equations based on the plume counts. This seems complex, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Another approach is to consider the ratio of plumes. Since strain B had more plumes (4 vs. 40), the lysogenic phage must be more effective against strain B than strain K. That makes sense because if the lysogenic phage is more effective on B, it would lead to more infections. Now, the recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = 1 - (plume_B / total_plumes)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, considering the plume counts as probabilities, the observed plumes could represent the expected number under some model. Maybe it's better to think in terms of probabilities. Let\u2019s denote p as the probability that a randomly selected phage from strain B causes lysogeny (does not lyse the cell). Similarly, q for strain K. The combined probability of both happening would be p*q if there's no recombination. If there's complete recombination, the combined probability would be zero, meaning the phage is fully recombinative and thus highly likely to lyse the cell. However, in our case, both mutations are in the same phage, so recombination implies that they have swapped segments, making the phage potentially more effective. But given that the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse strain B, it suggests that even when combined, the phage remains effective on B. Wait, but if recombination occurred, the phage would have a different fitness profile. Let me clarify: the lysogenic phage doesn\u2019t lyse B, so recombination might not affect this. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recall that in experimental studies involving double mutants, the number of plumes indicates the degree of interaction between the two mutations. The formula used is often:\n\nPlume_count = (number_of_mutations_in_phage) \u00d7 (probability_of_infection)\n\nBut without knowing the exact mechanism, it's tricky. Alternatively, the recombination frequency can be calculated using the plume counts relative to the expected values. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the probabilities minus their product. If there's significant recombination, the product term is small, so the expected plumes increase. Given that the observed plumes on strain B are much higher (4 vs. 40), it suggests that the combined phage is less effective on B than either mutation individually. Therefore, recombination must have occurred, allowing the combined phage to be less effective on B. To quantify recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nrf = (plume_B / (plume_B + plume_K)) \u00d7 100%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, considering the plume counts as probabilities, perhaps rf is such that (1 - rf)^2 = (plume_B)/(total_plumes). But I'm not confident about this approach. Alternatively, using the fact that the plume count reflects the probability of the combined effect. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2. With recombination, it's p1*p2. From the data, if strain B has more plumes, it suggests that the combined phage is less effective on B than either mutation alone, implying recombination. Let's set up equations. Let\u2019s assume that without recombination, the combined probability would be p1 + p2 - p1*p2. With recombination, it's p1*p2. We know that on strain B, the observed plumes are 4, and on strain K, 40. Let's suppose that the total plumes are 100% for simplicity. The combined probability on B is 4/100 = 0.04, and on K, it's 40/100 = 0.40. We can set up equations:\n\nCase 1: No Recombination:\nCombined prob on B: p1 + p2 - p1*p2 = 0.04\nCombined prob on K: p1 + p2 - p1*p2 = 0.40 \u2192 Contradiction, since same value can't equal 0.04 and 0.40.\n\nCase 2: Recombination:\nCombined prob on B: p1*p2 = 0.04\nCombined prob on K: p1*p2 = 0.40 \u2192 Again, contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the setup is incorrect. Perhaps the plume counts are not percentages but actual counts. Let's reconsider. Let\u2019s denote the number of cells plated as C_B and C_K. C_B is the number of cells on strain B, which is 1e7 times the number on strain K (since it's plated at 1:1e7). So if we let N be the number of cells on strain K, then C_B = 1e7*N and C_K = N. Each cell plates a certain number of phages, say n. Then the total number of phages plated on B is 1e7*N*n, and on K is N*n. The number of plumes is proportional to the number of phages that successfully infect and lyse the cell. For strain B, the number of plumes is 4, and for K, it's 40. So:\n\nOn B: 4 = k * (n * (1e7*N*n - \u03b4))\nOn K: 40 = k * (n * (N*n - \u03b4))\n\nWhere \u03b4 accounts for the death of phages that did not lyse (assuming \u03b4 is negligible or similar for both). Ignoring \u03b4, we can write:\n\n4 \u2248 k * n * (1e7*N*n)\n40 \u2248 k * n * (N*n)\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n40 / 4 = (k * n * (N*n)) / (k * n * (1e7*N*n)) ) \u2192 10 = 1/(1e7) \u2192 10 = 1e-7, which is clearly impossible. Thus, my approach is flawed. Maybe instead, I should focus on the ratio of plumes between the two strains. The ratio of plumes on K to B is 40/4=10. If recombination occurs, this ratio increases because the combined phage is less effective. The formula relating recombination frequency (rf) to the ratio R is:\n\nR = (1 - rf)/[1 - rf*(1 - rf)] \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected ratio R without recombination is 1/[1 - rf]. If recombination increases the effectiveness, the ratio decreases. Let me test with rf=0%: R=1/1=1. As rf increases, R decreases. So if R is 10, which is high, that corresponds to a low rf. Solving for rf when R=10:\n\n10 = [1] / [1 - rf]\n\n\u2192 10(1 - rf) = 1\n\n\u2192 10 - 10rf = 1\n\n\u2192 9 = 10rf\n\n\u2192 rf=90%. That's too high. Maybe the formula isn't correct. Alternatively, R = (1 - rf)^2. If R=10, then sqrt(10)=3.16\u22481 - rf \u2192 rf\u2248-216%, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me look for a simpler way. The problem states that the recombination frequency is determined by the observed plumes. Since strain B has a much higher number of plumes, it suggests that the combined phage is more effective on B than on K, which is counterintuitive unless there's significant recombination. The exact calculation might involve solving for rf such that the expected plumes match the observed numbers. However, without precise formulas, it's challenging. Looking back at the options, the highest rf mentioned is 5%, which is quite high. But given the discrepancy, perhaps rf is around 2-3%. Among the options, D is 0.05%, E is 0.2%, F is 0.3%, etc. The closest realistic answer based on typical recombination frequencies might be around 2%, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, the correct answer is D, 0.05%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well.

Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

Or perhaps it's because the lysogenic phage is being inhibited by the lysogenic mutation elsewhere. Hmm, no, the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission. So why would it be affecting strain B?\n\nWait, maybe the lysogenic phage is being selected against by another mutation. Because if the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse E. coli, then any phages that replicate without causing lytic fission would remain on the lysogenic phage genotype. But in this case, both phages are present, and only strain B is affected. That might suggest that the lysogenic phage isn't replicating correctly or is being suppressed by another mutation. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation that makes it fit better in the presence of the lysogenic mutation, allowing it to replicate more effectively. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage is under selection by the lysogenic mutation, causing it to dominate in certain conditions.\n\nBut back to the experiment. The result is that half of the population (after dilution) shows 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K. Wait, I'm confused. Because the phages are individual entities; if you plate multiple phages, you get multiple infections. But if the population is divided equally, then each half should have similar numbers. However, the dilution factors differ: 1e7 and 1e5. So one half is diluted much more (1e5), meaning fewer cells are plated, so fewer phages may infect. The other half is less diluted (1e7), so more cells are plated, more phages can infect. Now, if both mutation types are present, maybe their combination leads to some outcome where only strain B is affected. Perhaps the lysogenic phage is being induced to lyse, but since it doesn't do that, only the lysogenic is effective. But that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is being selected against by another mutation. For example, suppose the lysogenic phage has a mutation that confers resistance to the lysogenic phage itself. Then, even though it doesn't lyse the host, it wouldn't be selected against because it's resistant. This could allow it to replicate and potentially lead to its own lysogeny. But I'm not sure if that directly affects the outcome here.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes observed indicates the effectiveness of each phage type. Strain B had 40 plumes, while strain K had 4. So the lysogenic phage (which doesn't cause lytic fission) is more effective at infecting strain B than the other mutation. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is somehow better adapted to the environment. Maybe it has a mutation that allows it to replicate better or survive in a specific condition. \n\nNow, considering the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic information from different sources. In the context of phages, this could mean that one mutation provides a piece of DNA that combines with another mutation's DNA. The question is asking for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIn molecular biology, recombination frequency is often expressed as the percentage of double crossovers. Here, we're dealing with point mutations. The likelihood of recombination depends on the probability of two mutations occurring independently and the chance that they interact or influence each other.\n\nGiven the experimental data, if the two mutations don't contribute significantly to the same process, the recombination rate would be low. However, the difference in plume counts supports the idea that one mutation is more successful than the other. This suggests that the mutations might have interacted, leading to differential success rates.\n\nTo estimate recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total individuals) * 100%\n\nAssuming that the two mutations affect the replication efficiency of the phage, the recombination would determine whether their effects are additive or independent. If they completely recombine, the total effect would be maximum. If they don't recombine, their effects would add up multiplicatively.\n\nLooking at the results: Only strain B was affected. This implies that the lysogenic phage wasn't able to infect strain B. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have lost its ability to replicate in the presence of the lysogenic mutation. This loss of function suggests that the lysogenic mutation provided a mechanism to select against the lysogenic phage. So, the lysogenic mutation (mutant A) has a resistance allele that prevents the lysogenic phage (mutant B) from replicating, leading to reduced fitness of the lysogenic phage genotype.\n\nThis mechanism is known as horizontal gene transfer via homologous recombination, where the lysogenic mutation (resistant allele) allows the phage to replicate better in the presence of the lysogenic mutation. However, in this case, it's more likely that the lysogenic mutation confers a survival advantage by selecting against the lysogenic phage, thus favoring the lysogenic phage genotype.\n\nIf that's the case, the recombination between the two mutations would be zero because the lysogenic mutation doesn't recombine with the host's mutation\u2014it just selects against the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero, meaning no new genetic material is passed between the two mutations.\n\nHowever, the options given include percentages like 0.05% or 0.02%, which are very small. Zero isn't among them, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the recombination refers to the ability of the two mutations to influence each other's expression. For instance, one mutation providing a piece of DNA that can integrate with another mutation's DNA. If the mutations are independent, the chance of recombination is low. \n\nGiven that the experiment showed significant differences in plume counts, indicating selective pressure, it's possible that the two mutations partially recombine, but the overall effect is minimal. To calculate the recombination frequency, we can consider the expected outcomes. If the two mutations are independent, the probability that a double crossover occurs is approximately 1 in 1000, but that's not matching our options. Alternatively, using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, but that might not apply here.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the ratio of plumes. Strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. The ratio is 10:1. If the lysogenic phage is replicated 10 times more efficiently in strain B, this could indicate that the lysogenic mutation has a selective advantage, possibly through heterochromatin formation or other mechanisms. This could suggest that the lysogenic mutation (mutant A) is selected against by the host's mutation (mutant B), but in this case, it's working against the lysogenic phage, making it more fit.\n\nIn terms of recombination, if the two mutations are acting to maintain the lysogenic phage's copy number, they might not recombine. However, if the mutations are influencing each other's replication, such as one mutation providing a template for the other, recombination could occur. The exact calculation would depend on knowing the probabilities of each mutation and how they interact. Without specific data on these probabilities, it's challenging to compute the exact recombination percentage.\n\nGiven the options, the smallest non-zero value is 0.02%, which might correspond to a very low recombination rate. It's possible that the mutations are acting in a way that minimizes cross-talk, resulting in a low recombination frequency. However, without more detailed data, it's hard to say definitively. Given the options, 0.02% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

That would explain why when they plate on strain K, which may have a different mutation, they see 40 plumes on B, indicating that the combined phages are causing some effect, possibly due to a double mutation. \n\nThe key here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the two phages. In the context of DNA, recombination usually leads to a change in the gene sequence. For phages, this might involve a transposition or integration mechanism. The probability of such a recombination event is crucial in calculating the likelihood of the observed outcomes.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on strain B is 40, and on strain K is 4. Strain B was primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, while strain K had 4 plumes. This suggests that the recombination occurred in a way that increased the occurrence of a double mutation, but since strain B wasn't affected by the lysogenic phage, the double mutation must occur elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination caused a mutation that then worked differently in strain K. \n\nLet me recall the formula for estimating recombination frequency. It's often expressed as R = (1 - e^{-2p}), where p is the probability of recombination per chromatid. However, sometimes people use the odds form, like O = (1 - e^{-2p}) / (1 + e^{-2p}), but I'm not sure. Another approach is to calculate the expected number of double mutants based on the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently and the recombination rate.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the presence of both mutations likely leads to a double mutant. If recombination happened, the two mutations would be integrated into a single phage gene, making a double mutant. The probability of recombination determines the likelihood of this happening. \n\nGiven the results, when both phages are present, the number of plumes on strain B is much higher than on strain K. This suggests that the double mutant forms are more common in strain B than in strain K. If recombination occurred, the double mutants would appear more frequently, especially if the recombination rate is high. Conversely, if no recombination occurred, the double mutants would be rare or absent.\n\nThe numbers given suggest that the recombination might be low, but the exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of each mutation occurring independently is p. Then, the probability of both occurring without recombination is p * q, assuming independent mutations. With recombination, the probability becomes p * q * (1 + r), where r is the recombination fraction. But I'm getting confused; maybe I should look up the standard formula for estimating recombination frequencies from plating results.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in such experiments, the number of recombinant colonies is used to estimate the recombination frequency. The formula is:\n\nR = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies)\n\nBut in this case, the total number of colonies isn't directly given. Instead, we have two different treatments: one with 1e7 dilution and another with 1e5. Each treatment is plated on a separate lawn. The number of plumes (or colonies) depends on the dilution factor. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells, so fewer plumes. \n\nIn the first case, the lysogenic phage (from strain B) is present along with others. But when both are present, only the lysogenic affects strain B. On strain K, the lysogenic phage didn't do anything because strain K wasn't affected. Wait, but strain K was plated on a different lawn. Maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B crossed over with a mutation in strain K, creating a double mutant. \n\nIf the recombination occurred, then the double mutant would be present in both treatments. The ratio of plumes on K compared to B indicates the relative occurrence of the double mutant in each. \n\nThe formula for estimating the recombination frequency using the number of recombinants (R) is:\n\nR = (n_r) / (n_r + n_s)\n\nwhere n_r is the number of recombinant colonies and n_s is the number of non-recombinant colonies. However, in this case, all the colonies are either on strain B or K, so n_r would be the number of double mutants on both strains. But the experiment shows that strain B had more plumes (40 vs. 4), suggesting more double mutants in B. \n\nWait, but if strain K wasn't affected by the lysogenic phage, then any double mutants would have to come from another source, like recombination within the lysogenic phage itself. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the concept of interference in recombination. Interference reduces the probability of multiple crossovers, affecting the observed recombination frequency. However, I don't know the level of interference here, so I'll proceed under the assumption of simple Mendelian inheritance.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of double mutants based on the probabilities of each mutation occurring and the recombination rate. Let's denote the probability of the lysogenic phage causing lysis as P_l and the probability of the other mutation as P_m. The recombination rate R is the probability that the two mutations are exchanged. \n\nIf recombination occurred, the probability of a double mutant would be P_l * P_m * (1 + R/2), considering that recombination can increase the likelihood of co-occurrence. Without recombination, it would just be P_l * P_m. \n\nGiven that strain B was primarily affected by the lysogenic phage, and strain K showed some effect, maybe the recombination occurred in a way that created double mutants on both strains. The ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This suggests that the recombination occurred more frequently in strain B than in strain K. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, I can use the following formula derived from plating data:\n\nR = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies)\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinant colonies is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the two mutations multiplied by the recombination rate. However, without knowing the exact probabilities, I might need to make some assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem provides four plumes on K and 40 on B, and the initial condition before mixing was that both strains were equally affected, perhaps the difference in plumes reflects the effect of recombination. The ratio of plumes is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, indicating that recombination caused ten times more double mutants on B than on K. \n\nIf recombination occurred at a rate of R, then the number of double mutants would depend on R. Assuming that without recombination, the double mutants would have been equal on both strains, but with recombination, the count on one would be higher. The exact value of R can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = ln(n_r / n_s) \n\nWhere n_r is the number of recombinant colonies and n_s is the number of non-recombinant colonies. But I'm not entirely confident about this formula. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the probability of recombination:\n\nP_recomb = (n_r) / (n_r + n_s)\n\nBut again, without knowing n_r and n_s separately, it's tricky. Given the limited information, I'll try to reason it out. \n\nThe fact that there are four plumes on K and 40 on B suggests that recombination occurred in a way that significantly increased the occurrence of double mutants in strain B. The percentage difference between 40 and 4 is quite large, so recombination must have been significant. \n\nLooking at the options provided: the possible answers are in percentages, ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. These correspond to very low levels of recombination. \n\nIf recombination were complete (100%), then the double mutants would have appeared in both strains equally, but the counts are unequal. Therefore, a small recombination rate must have occurred. \n\nUsing the approximate formula for recombination frequency from plating data:\n\nR \u2248 (number of recombinant colonies) / (total number of colonies)\n\nTotal number of colonies = 40 (B) + 4 (K) = 44\n\nNumber of recombinant colonies = 40 - 4 = 36 (assuming 4 are non-recombinant, but this is speculative)\n\nSo R \u2248 36 / 44 \u2248 0.818, which is about 82%, but this contradicts the answer choices. Thus, my assumption is incorrect. \n\nMaybe the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plumes corresponds to the number of recombinant events. If the recombination rate is R, then the number of recombinant events would relate to R. However, without precise calculations, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact value. \n\nConsidering the options, the highest plausible recombination rate among the choices is 0.5%, followed by 0.3%. Given that the ratio is 10:1, a moderate level of recombination seems reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the most probable answer is F. 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since the problem asks about recombination, I'm guessing it's related to whether the mutations interact or cause a double mutation. \n\nWait, but in the first scenario, only lysogenic phages affect strain B, meaning the lysogenic phage has the mutation. The other type doesn't affect it. When both are present, perhaps the phages from each type can cause different effects depending on their combination. Or maybe they combine, leading to a new mutation. However, the initial experiment shows that in a mixed culture, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So why does the second part happen? Because when they plate on strain K, which might be a different strain, the recombination could lead to a situation where the lysogenic phage from the lysogenic group crosses over with another mutation, causing a double mutation.

This is often due to genetic interference or recombination. \n\nIn the first case, when only lysogenic phages are present, all of E. coli strain B dies. That makes sense because lysogenic phages usually integrate their genes into the host genome, leading to better survival. However, when both types are present, only part of the strain B survives, indicating that the two types interact somehow. The other strain, K, shows a significant number of infections, which suggests that K has a different mutation that allows it to survive despite the presence of both types from B.\n\nThe numbers given are important: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. Plumes represent individual infections, so a high number indicates a strong response. But considering the dilutions, we need to calculate the expected number of plumes based on probabilities. For the strain B half, it was plated at a lower dilution (1:1e5), meaning more cells were plated, so the probability of each phage causing a plume is higher. However, the outcome depends on whether the phage mutants can coexist without interfering.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this using the concept of genetic interference. In the presence of two mutations, especially in phages, they can either interfere with each other or not. If they do, the recombination rate determines whether they cause independent events or not. Recombination would lead to different probabilities of infection. Since the problem states that both mutations are present, the observed outcomes suggest some level of recombination.\n\nLet me try calculating the expected number of plumes if there was no recombination. If strain B's half was plated at 1:1e5, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Similarly, for the K half, plated at 1:1e7, the expectation would depend on the same logic.\n\nBut wait, the actual number of plumes observed is much lower than expected under complete independence. This discrepancy points towards some form of interference where the occurrence of one mutation affects the likelihood of another. Specifically, if the mutations recombine, the effect might be additive rather than multiplicative, leading to less interference.\n\nAlternatively, recombination could lead to the two mutations acting independently, but in reality, they don't always act independently. Some studies show that when two mutations are present, even if they're linked, the probability of their combination being present increases, reducing the overall effectiveness. This is known as genetic interference.\n\nTo quantify this, I'll use the formula for expected number of recombinant events. If the recombination rate (R) is the fraction of double-strand breaks, then the expected number of recombinations (or events) would be R times the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring separately.\n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's simpler to consider the ratio of the observed plumes to the expected plumes under independence. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the products of the probabilities of each mutation. If there's some recombination, the probabilities change accordingly.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent (no recombination), the expected number of plumes from strain B's half would be P(B) * P(K) * total cells. Similarly for strain K's half. But since both are present, the expected number would be calculated based on the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The key is to determine the probability of each mutation occurring and then see how they interact.\n\nFor strain B's half: Plated at 1:1e5, so the probability that any given phage carries a mutation is p_B = 1/(1e5 + 1) \u2248 1/1e5. Similarly, for strain K's half: p_K = 1/(1e7 + 1) \u2248 1e-7.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p_B * p_K \u2248 1e-12. Then, the expected number of plumes would be the number of cells plated multiplied by this probability. However, in reality, we have multiple plumes, so the calculation changes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall that when two mutations occur in a phage, the combined effect can be modeled by considering the product of their individual probabilities. The observed number of plumes can help estimate this product.\n\nGiven that strain B's half had 40 plumes and K's half had 4, we can set up equations based on the expected values. Assuming independence:\n\nFor strain B's half:\nExpected plumes = (number of cells plated) * (p_B * p_K)\n\nSimilarly, for strain K's half:\nExpected plumes = (number of cells plated) * (q_B * q_K)\n\nWhere q_B and q_K are the probabilities of carrying the respective mutations in the K half. But wait, if the mutations are recombined, the probabilities may differ.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination occurs, the probabilities of each mutation might change relative to the other. This complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the recombination frequency, which is the proportion of double-strand break sites between two homologous regions. This frequency is related to the probability of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) is typically expressed as a percentage. For example, a RF of 0% means no recombination, while 100% means perfect recombination. In this context, the recombination frequency would relate to the number of recombined double-strand breaks, which in turn affects the probability of the two mutations combining.\n\nThe observed number of plumes gives us information about the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring, adjusted for recombination. If there's no recombination, the product would be the simple multiplication. If there's some recombination, the effective probability of each mutation might change, affecting the expected number of plumes.\n\nThis seems too involved for my current knowledge. Perhaps I can look for a simpler way. Since both strains are being tested, and the results indicate that strain B is mostly killed, but K has some survivors, it suggests that the presence of both mutations leads to reduced efficiency. This reduction is likely due to genetic interference, which reduces the likelihood of both mutations being present simultaneously.\n\nGenetic interference is often measured by the coefficient of coincidence (COC), which quantifies the deviation from Poisson statistics. It is calculated as the observed number of double events divided by the expected number of double events under random distribution.\n\nSo, the COC would be (observed double events) / (expected double events).

Since the problem states that both mutations are present, the observed outcomes suggest some level of recombination.\n\nLet me try calculating the expected number of plumes if there was no recombination. If strain B's half was plated at 1:1e5, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. Similarly, for the K half, plated at 1:1e7, the expectation would depend on the same logic.\n\nBut wait, the actual number of plumes observed is much lower than expected under complete independence. This discrepancy points towards some form of interference where the occurrence of one mutation affects the likelihood of another. Specifically, if the mutations recombine, the effect might be additive rather than multiplicative, leading to less interference.\n\nAlternatively, recombination could lead to the two mutations acting independently, but in reality, they don't always act independently. Some studies show that when two mutations are present, even if they're linked, the probability of their combination being present increases, reducing the overall effectiveness. This is known as genetic interference.\n\nTo quantify this, I'll use the formula for expected number of recombinant events. If the recombination rate (R) is the fraction of double-strand breaks, then the expected number of recombinations (or events) would be R times the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring separately.\n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's simpler to consider the ratio of the observed plumes to the expected plumes under independence. If there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes would be the sum of the products of the probabilities of each mutation. If there's some recombination, the probabilities change accordingly.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent (no recombination), the expected number of plumes from strain B's half would be P(B) * P(K) * total cells. Similarly for strain K's half. But since both are present, the expected number would be calculated based on the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The key is to determine the probability of each mutation occurring and then see how they interact.\n\nFor strain B's half: Plated at 1:1e5, so the probability that any given phage carries a mutation is p_B = 1/(1e5 + 1) \u2248 1/1e5. Similarly, for strain K's half: p_K = 1/(1e7 + 1) \u2248 1e-7.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p_B * p_K \u2248 1e-12. Then, the expected number of plumes would be the number of cells plated multiplied by this probability. However, in reality, we have multiple plumes, so the calculation changes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall that when two mutations occur in a phage, the combined effect can be modeled by considering the product of their individual probabilities. The observed number of plumes can help estimate this product.\n\nGiven that strain B's half had 40 plumes and K's half had 4, we can set up equations based on the expected values. Assuming independence:\n\nFor strain B's half:\nExpected plumes = (number of cells plated) * (p_B * p_K)\n\nSimilarly, for strain K's half:\nExpected plumes = (number of cells plated) * (q_B * q_K)\n\nWhere q_B and q_K are the probabilities of carrying the respective mutations in the K half. But wait, if the mutations are recombined, the probabilities may differ.\n\nAlternatively, if recombination occurs, the probabilities of each mutation might change relative to the other. This complicates things further.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to calculate the recombination frequency, which is the proportion of double-strand break sites between two homologous regions. This frequency is related to the probability of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination frequency (RF) is typically expressed as a percentage. For example, a RF of 0% means no recombination, while 100% means perfect recombination. In this context, the recombination frequency would relate to the number of recombined double-strand breaks, which in turn affects the probability of the two mutations combining.\n\nThe observed number of plumes gives us information about the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring, adjusted for recombination. If there's no recombination, the product would be the simple multiplication. If there's some recombination, the effective probability of each mutation might change, affecting the expected number of plumes.\n\nThis seems too involved for my current knowledge. Perhaps I can look for a simpler way. Since both strains are being tested, and the results indicate that strain B is mostly killed, but K has some survivors, it suggests that the presence of both mutations leads to reduced efficiency. This reduction is likely due to genetic interference, which reduces the likelihood of both mutations being present simultaneously.\n\nGenetic interference is often measured by the coefficient of coincidence (COC), which quantifies the deviation from Poisson statistics. It is calculated as the observed number of double events divided by the expected number of double events under random distribution.\n\nSo, the COC would be (observed double events) / (expected double events). If COC > 1, it indicates positive interference; if </think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",

    "rollout": " In the first case, when the phages are pure (only lysogenic), most of the bacteria die, indicating that the lysogenic phages cause issues. When mixed with lysogenic, half the bacteria survive, which might suggest that the lysogenic and another type combined in such a way that only a subset survives. Then, the second part uses different dilutions. Plated on strain B with 1:10^7 dilution, expecting fewer infections, but only 40 plumes on B. On strain K with 1:10^5, 4 plumes. Hmm, wait, no\u2014plumes represent individual infections, right? So 4 plumes on K would mean 4 new phages entering the bacteria, and same on B. Now, considering that when both types are present, the outcome depends on their interactions. Maybe the presence of one phage affects the replication of the other. For example, if the lysogenic phage inhibits the replication of the lysogenic phage itself, leading to more lysogenic phages being produced, thus killing more bacteria. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage could be super-infecting the lysogenic ones. But from the data, after mixing, only half of the population dies compared to when only one type is used. That suggests some kind of recombination where the two types work together to reduce the overall number of survivors. When they're mixed at half the dilution, the survival rate drops further to 40% on strain B and 4% on strain K. This implies that when both types are present in equal concentrations, the probability of infection decreases significantly. \n\nThe question asks for the recombination level between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the interaction between two genes that allows them to influence each other's expression. In phages, this often leads to changes in the prophage structure, affecting replication efficiency. The degree of recombination can affect the fitness of the phage, as seen here\u2014the presence of two mutations reduces the chance of infection, suggesting that they work together to suppress the target E. coli. \n\nIn experiments like these, the expected frequency of recombinant offspring can be estimated using Mendelian principles. If the two mutations are independent, the probability of recombinant phenotypes should be around 20-25%. However, if they are linked, the probabilities change accordingly. But given the numbers provided, we can calculate the expected recombination frequency. The formula for the probability of recombinant gametes is (n * r * (1 - r)) / 2, where n is the number of loci and r is the recombination fraction. But without knowing n, perhaps a simpler approach is better. \n\nLooking at the results: When both phages are present at half the dilution, only 40% of the bacteria survived. This seems to indicate significant interference between the two mutations. If each mutation alone had a certain survival rate, combining them reduces the chance even further. Suppose each mutation individually has a survival rate of p. Combining them would reduce it to p*q, depending on their relationship. \n\nAlternatively, considering that when only lysogenic phages are present, all but a small percentage die, implying low recombination. When both are present, half the population survives, meaning some combination occurs. When both are at half the dilution, only 40% survive, which is a reduction from the pure lysogenic case (where 96% died, so 4% survived). At double the dilution, only 4% survive. \n\nWait, hold on. If the lysogenic phage alone is 96% survival, and when mixed with another mutation, it becomes 4%, which is a big drop. But when both are at half the dilution, it's 40%, and at double, 4%. So the effect increases with dilution. This suggests that the mutations are working together to suppress the phage. So the presence of one mutation increases the likelihood of the other being active, leading to reduced overall susceptibility. \n\nTo estimate the recombination frequency, we can use the fact that when two mutations interact, the probability of recombination is proportional to the product of their frequencies. If each mutation contributes to the suppression of the phage, then the total suppression factor is the sum of their individual suppression factors minus their product. \n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to look at the observed outcomes. The pure lysogenic (only lysogenic) gives 4% survival. When mixed with another mutation at half the dilution, 40% survives. So the additional mutation is causing a big increase in survival. Similarly, when both are at double the dilution, only 4% survive again. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations are interfering constructively, allowing them to work synergistically to reduce the number of survivors. To model this, suppose that the initial survival is S = 4% (when lysogenic alone). When mixed with another mutation at half the dilution, the survival becomes S + \u0394S. If \u0394S is large enough to bring it down to 40%, then:\n\n4% + \u0394S = 40%\n\nSo \u0394S = 36%\n\nBut this seems too much; perhaps instead, it's multiplicative. Let\u2019s consider that the probability of surviving when both mutations are present is the product of their individual survival probabilities minus any interference. But without exact formulas, it's tricky. Alternatively, thinking in terms of the expected number of plasmids: Each phage carries a single mutation. If both mutations are present, each bacterium may get two mutations, reducing its chance of infection. \n\nGiven that when both mutations are present at half the dilution, 40% survive, and at double dilution, 4% survive. We can model this as a function of the recombination frequency. Let\u2019s assume that R is the recombination frequency. Then, the survival probability when both mutations are present is S = s1 + s2 - R*s1*s2, where s1 and s2 are the individual survival rates. \n\nFrom the pure lysogenic case, s1 = 0.04 (since 4% survive). When mixed with another mutation at half the dilution, S = 0.4. So:\n\n0.4 = 0.04 + s2 - R*0.04*s2\n\nSimilarly, when both are at double dilution, S = 0.04. So:\n\n0.04 = 0.04 + s2 - R*0.04*s2\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n0.04 - 0.4 = (0.04 + s2 - R*0.04*s2) - (0.04 + s2 - R*0.04*s2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-0.36 = 0\n\nThat can\u2019t be right. Perhaps my assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe it's additive rather than subtractive. Alternatively, perhaps the survival when both mutations are present is s1 + s2 - R*(1 - s1)(1 - s2). Not sure. Another approach: Since when both mutations are present, the survival drops to 40% (so 80% death rate) when mixed at half dilution, and 96% death rate when both are pure lysogenic. Wait, no\u2014if pure lysogenic gives 4% survival, that's 96% death. Mix with another mutation at half dilution, 40% survival, meaning 60% death. So when both are present at half dilution, death is 60%. When both are pure lysogenic, death is 96%. So the effect of adding another mutation at half dilution is to decrease the death rate from 96% to 60%. How much did that happen?\n\nThe ratio of deaths when both are lysogenic vs. when mixed is 96/60 \u2248 1.6. So adding another mutation increased the death rate by about 60%. That might suggest that the mutation interferes with the lysogenic phage, reducing its effectiveness.\n\nNow, when both mutations are at double dilution, the survival rate drops to 4%, which is 96% death. So comparing that to when both are lysogenic (96% death), nothing changed\u2014that's confusing. Or maybe when both are at double dilution, the survival is 4%, so death rate is 96%. But earlier, when both were at half dilution, death was 60%. That suggests that at double dilution, the death rate remains the same as when both are lysogenic. Hmm, that\u2019s interesting. So adding another mutation at double dilution didn't change the outcome beyond the lysogenic case. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations interfere constructively at half dilution, but don't interfere anymore at double dilution. So the recombination frequency must allow the mutations to interfere constructively at half dilution but not at double. What recombination frequency corresponds to this behavior? \n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the interference effect would depend on their proximity. If the distance between them is small, the interference is stronger. Conversely, if the mutations are far apart, the interference is minimal. \n\nAssuming the mutations are close (recombinant frequency is high), adding another mutation at half dilution would create a situation where the new mutation can either enhance or interfere with the existing one. If the recombination frequency is high, the two mutations are likely to interfere constructively, meaning the presence of one increases the likelihood of the other being active. \n\nLet\u2019s try calculating the recombination frequency needed to make the death rate when both are at half dilution 60% (from 96%). Let\u2019s denote R as the recombination frequency. The formula for the death rate D when two mutations are present is D = 1 - s1 - s2 + R*s1*s2. Here, s1 is the survival rate of the lysogenic phage (0.04), and s2 is the survival rate of the other mutation (which we'll call s2). \n\nAt half dilution, D = 0.4 (40% survival). So:\n\n0.4 = 1 - 0.04 - s2 + R*0.04*s2  \n0.4 = 0.96 - s2 + 0.04*R*s2  \nRearranging:\ns2 - 0.04*R*s2 = 0.96 - 0.4  \ns2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.56  \nEquation 1: s2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.56\n\nWhen both mutations are at double dilution, D = 0.04 (4% survival). So:\n\n0.04 = 1 - 0.04 - s2 + R*0.04*s2  \n0.04 = 0.96 - s2 + 0.04*R*s2  \nRearranging:\ns2 - 0.04*R*s2 = 0.96 - 0.04  \ns2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.92  \nEquation 2: s2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.92\n\nNow, divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\n(s2*(1 - 0.04*R)) / (s2*(1 - 0.04*R)) = 0.56 / 0.92  \n1 = 0.56 / 0.92  \nWhich is approximately 0.56 / 0.92 \u2248 0.61. \n\nBut this contradicts our expectation, since 0.56 \u2260 0.92. Therefore, my initial assumption about the formula is probably incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is different. \n\nAlternative approach: Assume that when both mutations are present, the survival rate is s1 + s2 - R*s1*s2. When both are pure lysogenic, s1 = 0.04, and s2=0.04. So D = 1 - 0.04 - 0.04 + R*0.04*0.04 = 0.92 + R*0.0016. \n\nAt half dilution, D = 0.4 (40%):\n\n0.4 = 0.92 + R*0.0016  \nR*0.0016 = 0.48  \nR \u2248 0.48 / 0.0016 = 300  \n\nBut that's impossible because recombination frequencies are usually less than 50%. So clearly, this formula isn't correct. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is D = 1 - s1*s2/(1 + R*s1*s2). Not sure. Alternatively, it's possible that the presence of one mutation increases the likelihood of the other, but the exact relationship complicates things. Given time constraints, perhaps I should recall that in cases where two mutations interfere, the effective selection coefficient can be approximated, and recombination frequency can be calculated accordingly. \n\nAnother angle: The problem states that the two mutations cause the lytic fission of strain B but not K. When mixed, half the population dies, while the other half is still viable. When the other half is plated with strain K, only 4 plumes are found on K, and 40 on B. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation significantly reduces the number of plasmids on strain B, while the presence of the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K as much. \n\nWait, no\u2014the phage can attack both strains. When both mutations are present, half the population dies regardless of the host, which makes sense because the lysogenic phage would kill all of them. But when only one mutation is present, only a portion die. So when mixed, the extra mutation increases the lethality beyond the lysogenic case. When both are at half dilution, lethality increases further. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations interfere constructively, so that when both are present, their combined effect is more lethal than either alone. The recombination frequency determines how strongly they interfere. \n\nSince the problem provides specific numbers, perhaps it's best to think in terms of the possible answer choices. The options are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 0.5% incrementally. Since the mutations are interacting to reduce lethality, a moderate recombination frequency would make sense. \n\nLooking back, the options include 0.02%, which is quite low, but that would mean almost non-recombining mutations. Alternatively, 0.05% is also low. However, considering the significant increase in lethality upon addition of another mutation, the recombination frequency must be relatively high. Options G to J are above 0.05%, up to 0.5%. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5%, which is a common recombination frequency in some bacterial systems. It allows for significant interference, which fits the scenario described. \n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I'm leaning towards option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

If the recombination frequency is high, the two mutations are likely to interfere constructively, meaning the presence of one increases the likelihood of the other being active. \n\nLet\u2019s try calculating the recombination frequency needed to make the death rate when both are at half dilution 60% (from 96%). Let\u2019s denote R as the recombination frequency. The formula for the death rate D when two mutations are present is D = 1 - s1 - s2 + R*s1*s2. Here, s1 is the survival rate of the lysogenic phage (0.04), and s2 is the survival rate of the other mutation (which we'll call s2). \n\nAt half dilution, D = 0.4 (40% survival). So:\n\n0.4 = 1 - 0.04 - s2 + R*0.04*s2  \n0.4 = 0.96 - s2 + 0.04*R*s2  \nRearranging:\ns2 - 0.04*R*s2 = 0.96 - 0.4  \ns2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.56  \nEquation 1: s2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.56\n\nWhen both mutations are at double dilution, D = 0.04 (4% survival). So:\n\n0.04 = 1 - 0.04 - s2 + R*0.04*s2  \n0.04 = 0.96 - s2 + 0.04*R*s2  \nRearranging:\ns2 - 0.04*R*s2 = 0.96 - 0.04  \ns2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.92  \nEquation 2: s2*(1 - 0.04*R) = 0.92\n\nNow, divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\n(s2*(1 - 0.04*R)) / (s2*(1 - 0.04*R)) = 0.56 / 0.92  \n1 = 0.56 / 0.92  \nWhich is approximately 0.56 / 0.92 \u2248 0.61. \n\nBut this contradicts our expectation, since 0.56 \u2260 0.92. Therefore, my initial assumption about the formula is probably incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is different. \n\nAlternative approach: Assume that when both mutations are present, the survival rate is s1 + s2 - R*s1*s2. When both are pure lysogenic, s1 = 0.04, and s2=0.04. So D = 1 - 0.04 - 0.04 + R*0.04*0.04 = 0.92 + R*0.0016. \n\nAt half dilution, D = 0.4 (40%):\n\n0.4 = 0.92 + R*0.0016  \nR*0.0016 = 0.48  \nR \u2248 0.48 / 0.0016 = 300  \n\nBut that's impossible because recombination frequencies are usually less than 50%. So clearly, this formula isn't correct. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is D = 1 - s1*s2/(1 + R*s1*s2). Not sure. Alternatively, it's possible that the presence of one mutation increases the likelihood of the other, but the exact relationship complicates things. Given time constraints, perhaps I should recall that in cases where two mutations interfere, the effective selection coefficient can be approximated, and recombination frequency can be calculated accordingly. \n\nAnother angle: The problem states that the two mutations cause the lytic fission of strain B but not K. When mixed, half the population dies, while the other half is still viable. When the other half is plated with strain K, only 4 plumes are found on K, and 40 on B. This suggests that the presence of the other mutation significantly reduces the number of plasmids on strain B, while the presence of the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K as much. \n\nWait, no\u2014the phage can attack both strains. When both mutations are present, half the population dies regardless of the host, which makes sense because the lysogenic phage would kill all of them. But when only one mutation is present, only a portion die. So when mixed, the extra mutation increases the lethality beyond the lysogenic case. When both are at half dilution, lethality increases further. \n\nThis suggests that the two mutations interfere constructively, so that when both are present, their combined effect is more lethal than either alone. The recombination frequency determines how strongly they interfere. \n\nSince the problem provides specific numbers, perhaps it's best to think in terms of the possible answer choices. The options are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 0.5% incrementally. Since the mutations are interacting to reduce lethality, a moderate recombination frequency would make sense. \n\nLooking back, the options include 0.02%, which is quite low, but that would mean almost non-recombining mutations. Alternatively, 0.05% is also low. However, considering the significant increase in lethality upon addition of another mutation, the recombination frequency must be relatively high. Options G to J are above 0.05%, up to 0.5%. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1.5%, which is a common recombination frequency in some bacterial systems. It allows for significant interference, which fits the scenario described. \n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I'm leaning towards option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Since only strain B shows significant lysis without K, perhaps their interactions lead to some combination.",
    "rollout": " Since only strain B shows significant lysis without K, perhaps their interactions lead to some combination. \n\nWait, the problem states that both types are present. So when they mix, either one could cause issues or they might interact. In the first case, only B is affected, suggesting that maybe the lysogenic phage takes over. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might be causing the issue because it doesn't lyse the host, leading to better replication within the same cell, possibly causing stress or instability. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might integrate its mutation into the phage's genome, causing recombinant expression. But wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So the key here is the number of plasmid copies or the likelihood of integration.\n\nIn experiments like this, when multiple mutants are used, the presence of cross-reactivity can indicate whether they're interacting. However, in this case, only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage (the non-lytic type) isn't interacting with the lysogenic mutation. Instead, perhaps the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) is integrating its mutation into the phage's genome, causing recombination. But wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't integrate its mutation; it's supposed to replicate without changing the phage itself. Unless the lysogenic mutation somehow affects the phage's ability to integrate or replicate. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might produce a new copy of the mutated gene, leading to recombination.\n\nBut according to the experiment results, when both types are present, strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage isn't causing the issue. Therefore, the recombination must be happening elsewhere, probably within the phage's own genome. So the lysogenic mutation might have integrated into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant protein. Now, the presence of four plumes on K suggests that the phages are being expressed at a certain level. The dilutions are different: 1e5 vs 1e7. So the ratio of plumes depends on the concentration of phages. If the concentration is too high, you get more plumes, but if too low, fewer. The fact that K has 4 plumes and B has 40 indicates that the phages on K are less concentrated than those on B. That would suggest that the phages on K are dilute enough that they don't reach as many plumes as those on B, but they still have some activity. This implies that the lysogenic phage on K is expressing its mutations at a lower concentration than on B.\n\nNow, considering that the lysogenic mutation didn't affect strain B but did affect strain K, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing issues in K because it's integrating into the phage's own genome, leading to recombination. The question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations\u2014so how much did the lysogenic mutation integrate into the T_4 phage?\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Number of Offspring)\n\nHere, the \"offspring\" would correspond to the number of plumes on each strain. On B, there are 40 plumes, and on K, there are 4. The total number of plumes is 44. The number of recombinant plumes would depend on the probability of recombination. Assuming that the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to R times the product of the concentrations of the two phages.\n\nBut wait, in this experiment, both strains are present in equal amounts, right? Because the initial population was split equally into two plates\u2014one for B and one for K. So each plate should have half of the original population. Then, each plate is diluted differently. For the B plate, the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning that each well has 1e-7 of the original population. Similarly, the K plate is diluted at 1e5, so each well has 1e-5 of the original population. The actual number of plumes would depend on the number of phages that successfully infect the cells. Since the dilution factors are so high, the chance of each phage infecting a cell is very low, but the number of cells is higher, so the overall probability increases.\n\nThe number of plumes on a strain is given by N * p, where N is the number of phages per cell and p is the probability of each phage infecting a cell. Here, p is approximately equal to the dilution factor, say \u03b5, since \u03b5 is the proportion of cells plated per well. So N_plume_B = N_B * \u03b5_B, and similarly for K. Given that \u03b5_B = 1e-7 and \u03b5_K = 1e-5, and assuming N_B = N_K = N (since they're plated equally), then N_plume_B \u2248 N * 1e-7 and N_plume_K \u2248 N * 1e-5.\n\nFrom the data, N_plume_B = 40 and N_plume_K = 4. So,\n\n40 \u2248 N * 1e-7 \u21d2 N \u2248 4e8 phages per well\n\nAnd\n\n4 \u2248 N * 1e-5 \u21d2 N \u2248 4e6 phages per well\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, so perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Maybe the dilution factors are applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the difference in dilution factors leads to a change in the number of plumes due to the interaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference comes from the fact that the lysogenic mutation integrated into the phage, affecting the recombination. The recombination frequency would be determined by the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently with frequencies f1 and f2, the recombination frequency R would be approximately f1 * f2.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate f1 and f2. From the experiment, on the B plate, the number of plumes is 40, and on the K plate, it's 4. Since both are plated under similar conditions except for the dilution factor, the plume count reflects the relative concentrations of the phages.\n\nIf we consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two mutations, then:\n\nN_B \u221d (f1_B * \u03b5_B) * (f2_B * \u03b5_B)\nN_K \u221d (f1_K * \u03b5_K) * (f2_K * \u03b5_K)\n\nBut assuming that both mutations occur independently, f1_B = f1_K = f1 and f2_B = f2_K = f2, then:\n\nN_B / N_K = (\u03b5_B / \u03b5_K)^2\n\nPlugging in values:\n\n40 / 4 = (1e-7 / 1e-5)^2 \u21d2 10 = (1e-2)^2 \u21d2 10 = 1e-4 \u2192 No, this doesn't make sense. It suggests that the ratio is way off. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination occurs during the incubation period, so the timing matters. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome before the incubation starts, then the recombination would happen early, affecting all plasmids at once. This would increase the chance of both mutations being present in the same plasmid.\n\nIn such a scenario, the recombination frequency R would be the product of the individual recombination rates of each mutation. Suppose each mutation occurs with a recombination rate r. Then R = r1 * r2.\n\nBut how do we find r1 and r2? We know that on the B plate, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, while on the K plate, the lysogenic phage also caused issues. Therefore, the lysogenic phage did cause issues in K, implying that recombination occurred in K but not in B. Therefore, the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage's genome in K, causing recombination, but not in B, where it didn't integrate.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency R is the fraction of phages that have both mutations. Since the lysogenic phage integrated, R would be the product of the recombination rates of each mutation.\n\nBut to estimate R, we can look at the number of plumes. On B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, meaning that most plumes came from the lysogenic phage, but none from the non-lytic phage. On K, some plumes came from the lysogenic phage and others from the non-lytic phage. The ratio of plumes on K to B gives us information about the relative contributions of the two mutations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P_K = number of plumes on K = 4\n- P_B = number of plumes on B = 40\n\nEach plume corresponds to a phage that successfully replicated in the host cell. The probability of a phage replicating successfully is proportional to the concentration of phages and the chance of each phage infecting the cell. Assuming that the concentration of phages is the same on both plates (since they're plated equally), then the number of successful infections is proportional to the concentration of phages times the probability of each phage infecting the cell.\n\nSince the dilution factor is 1e5 for K and 1e7 for B, the concentration of phages on each plate is:\n\nConcentration = (Number of phages per well) / (Dilution Factor)\n\nAssuming the number of phages per well is the same, the concentration would be higher on the B plate (due to lower dilution factor) compared to the K plate (higher dilution factor).\n\nSo, Concentration_B = C / 1e7\nConcentration_K = C / 1e5\n\nWhere C is the number of phages per well.\n\nThe number of plumes on each plate is then:\n\nPlumes_B = Concentration_B * \u03b5_B = (C / 1e7) * 1e-7 = C * 1e-14\nPlumes_K = Concentration_K * \u03b5_K = (C / 1e5) * 1e-5 = C * 1e-10\n\nBut the actual numbers given are Plumes_B = 40 and Plumes_K = 4. So:\n\n40 = C * 1e-14 \u2192 C \u2248 4e15 phages per well\n4 = C * 1e-10 \u2192 C \u2248 4e11 phages per well\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my model is flawed. Perhaps the plume counts aren't directly proportional to the product of concentrations and probabilities because the process is stochastic and the events are dependent.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes:\n\nP_K / P_B = (Concentration_K * \u03b5_K) / (Concentration_B * \u03b5_B) = ( (C / 1e5) * 1e-5 ) / ( (C / 1e7) * 1e-7 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ( (C * 1e-10) ) / ( (C * 1e-14) ) = 1e4\n\nWhich matches the observed ratio of 4/40 = 1/10, which is 0.1, or 10^-1. But our calculation shows 10^4, which is inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect. Perhaps the plume counts are influenced by the time of incubation. If the lysogenic phage integrated early, then both mutations would be present in the plasmid, whereas if they integrated later, only one mutation would be present. This would affect the plume distribution.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrated early, it would create a recombinant phage that contains both mutations. This phage would replicate faster, leading to more plumes. Conversely, a phage that didn't integrate would replicate normally, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that, on the K plate, there are more plumes (4) compared to B (40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated early on K, resulting in more plumes, while it didn't integrate on B, resulting in fewer plumes. However, the problem states that the lysogenic phage caused issues in both strains, meaning that it integrated somewhere. Wait, no\u2014it says that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage did not integrate in K, but the lysogenic mutation did integrate in K, causing recombination. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem states that both types are present. The T_4 phage carries two mutations: lysogenic and non-lytic. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so when it infects E. coli, it doesn't lyse the cell, causing problems. The non-lytic phage does lyse the cell. So when both are present, the E. coli may be affected in different ways depending on which phage is present.\n\nIn the first part of the experiment, only the lysogenic phage is present, leading to issues in E. coli B. When both are present, only the lysogenic phage is present again, leading to issues in E. coli K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage's genome in K, causing recombination, while it didn't integrate in B, perhaps because the lysogenic phage was already replicating without any interference, allowing the non-lytic phage to take over.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it should cause issues regardless. If only the lysogenic phage is present in K, it would cause issues. But if the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome in K, creating a recombinant phage, then even the lysogenic phage would replicate normally, but the recombinant phage would lyse the cell, causing issues. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that has both mutations. This phage would lyse the cell upon replication, leading to issues. So in B, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it doesn't lyse, causing issues. In K, where the lysogenic phage integrates into its genome, it now has a recombinant phage, which would lyse the cell, causing issues. But the problem states that only K has issues, which contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, but the non-lytic phage remains unaffected. So the lysogenic phage becomes a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse the cell. Thus, in B, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it doesn't lyse, causing issues. In K, where the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, it becomes a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse, so no issues. But the problem says that in K, the lysogenic phage is present but causes issues, so perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, making it a recombinant phage, but the non-lytic phage still exists and can lyse the cell. So in K, when both are present, the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, making it a recombinant phage, which doesn't lyse the cell, causing issues. In B, only the lysogenic phage is present, so it doesn't lyse, causing issues.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in both cases, the lysogenic phage causes issues in B but not in K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome in K, creating a recombinant phage that does not lyse the cell, thus causing issues in K. And in B, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, causing issues. But the problem says that in K, the lysogenic phage is present but causes issues, which aligns with this scenario.\n\nBut then, why is the K plate showing 4 plumes and B showing 40? If the lysogenic phage in K is a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse, then why would it infect cells? It would replicate normally, but wouldn't lyse the cell. So why would it cause issues? Unless the lysogenic phage is still present and can lyse the cell despite having mutations. But that seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it shouldn't cause issues. However, if the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that cannot lyse the cell, then in K, the lysogenic phage is present but does not lyse the cell, hence causing issues. But in reality, the lysogenic phage would lyse the cell unless it's been modified. So perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage in K leads to issues, indicating that it integrated into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse the cell.\n\nIn that case, the number of plumes on K would reflect the number of recombinant phages, while on B, only the normal lysogenic phage is present, causing issues. The difference in plume counts (4 vs 40) suggests that the integration happened earlier in K, leading to more recombinant phages. \n\nThe amount of recombination refers to the frequency with which the mutations are combined. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p1 + p2 - 2\u221a(p1*p2))\u00b2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact probabilities, we can instead approximate using the number of plumes. The presence of more plumes on K suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated earlier, leading to more recombinant phages. The number of plumes can give us an indication of the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to use the formula:\n\nR = (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the \"recombinant offspring\" would correspond to the lysogenically integrated phage, which is present in K but not B. The number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The total number of plumes is 44, and the number of recombinant plumes is 4 (assuming that all plumes on K are recombinant). \n\nUsing this, the recombination frequency would be:\n\nR = (4 / 44) \u00d7 100% \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided, which are in fractions like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 0.2%. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be simpler. The difference in plume counts",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. Since only strain B shows significant lysis without K, perhaps their interactions lead to some combination. \n\nWait, the problem states that both types are present. So when they mix, either one could cause issues or they might interact. In the first case, only B is affected, suggesting that maybe the lysogenic phage takes over. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might be causing the issue because it doesn't lyse the host, leading to better replication within the same cell, possibly causing stress or instability. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might integrate its mutation into the phage's genome, causing recombinant expression. But wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So the key here is the number of plasmid copies or the likelihood of integration.\n\nIn experiments like this, when multiple mutants are used, the presence of cross-reactivity can indicate whether they're interacting. However, in this case, only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage (the non-lytic type) isn't interacting with the lysogenic mutation. Instead, perhaps the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) is integrating its mutation into the phage's genome, causing recombination. But wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage shouldn't integrate its mutation; it's supposed to replicate without changing the phage itself. Unless the lysogenic mutation somehow affects the phage's ability to integrate or replicate. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage might produce a new copy of the mutated gene, leading to recombination.\n\nBut according to the experiment results, when both types are present, strain B is mostly affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage isn't causing the issue. Therefore, the recombination must be happening elsewhere, probably within the phage's own genome. So the lysogenic mutation might have integrated into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant protein. Now, the presence of four plumes on K suggests that the phages are being expressed at a certain level. The dilutions are different: 1e5 vs 1e7. So the ratio of plumes depends on the concentration of phages. If the concentration is too high, you get more plumes, but if too low, fewer. The fact that K has 4 plumes and B has 40 indicates that the phages on K are less concentrated than those on B. That would suggest that the phages on K are dilute enough that they don't reach as many plumes as those on B, but they still have some activity. This implies that the lysogenic phage on K is expressing its mutations at a lower concentration than on B.\n\nNow, considering that the lysogenic mutation didn't affect strain B but did affect strain K, perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing issues in K because it's integrating into the phage's own genome, leading to recombination. The question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations\u2014so how much did the lysogenic mutation integrate into the T_4 phage?\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring / Total Number of Offspring)\n\nHere, the \"offspring\" would correspond to the number of plumes on each strain. On B, there are 40 plumes, and on K, there are 4. The total number of plumes is 44. The number of recombinant plumes would depend on the probability of recombination. Assuming that the recombination rate is R, then the expected number of recombinant plumes would be proportional to R times the product of the concentrations of the two phages.\n\nBut wait, in this experiment, both strains are present in equal amounts, right? Because the initial population was split equally into two plates\u2014one for B and one for K. So each plate should have half of the original population. Then, each plate is diluted differently. For the B plate, the dilution factor is 1e7, meaning that each well has 1e-7 of the original population. Similarly, the K plate is diluted at 1e5, so each well has 1e-5 of the original population. The actual number of plumes would depend on the number of phages that successfully infect the cells. Since the dilution factors are so high, the chance of each phage infecting a cell is very low, but the number of cells is higher, so the overall probability increases.\n\nThe number of plumes on a strain is given by N * p, where N is the number of phages per cell and p is the probability of each phage infecting a cell. Here, p is approximately equal to the dilution factor, say \u03b5, since \u03b5 is the proportion of cells plated per well. So N_plume_B = N_B * \u03b5_B, and similarly for K. Given that \u03b5_B = 1e-7 and \u03b5_K = 1e-5, and assuming N_B = N_K = N (since they're plated equally), then N_plume_B \u2248 N * 1e-7 and N_plume_K \u2248 N * 1e-5.\n\nFrom the data, N_plume_B = 40 and N_plume_K = 4. So,\n\n40 \u2248 N * 1e-7 \u21d2 N \u2248 4e8 phages per well\n\nAnd\n\n4 \u2248 N * 1e-5 \u21d2 N \u2248 4e6 phages per well\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, so perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Maybe the dilution factors are applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the difference in dilution factors leads to a change in the number of plumes due to the interaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference comes from the fact that the lysogenic mutation integrated into the phage, affecting the recombination. The recombination frequency would be determined by the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nAssuming that each mutation occurs independently with frequencies f1 and f2, the recombination frequency R would be approximately f1 * f2.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate f1 and f2. From the experiment, on the B plate, the number of plumes is 40, and on the K plate, it's 4. Since both are plated under similar conditions except for the dilution factor, the plume count reflects the relative concentrations of the phages.\n\nIf we consider that the number of plumes is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two mutations, then:\n\nN_B \u221d (f1_B * \u03b5_B) * (f2_B * \u03b5_B)\nN_K \u221d (f1_K * \u03b5_K) * (f2_K * \u03b5_K)\n\nBut assuming that both mutations occur independently, f1_B = f1_K = f1 and f2_B = f2_K = f2, then:\n\nN_B / N_K = (\u03b5_B / \u03b5_K)^2\n\nPlugging in values:\n\n40 / 4 = (1e-7 / 1e-5)^2 \u21d2 10 = (1e-2)^2 \u21d2 10 = 1e-4 \u2192 No, this doesn't make sense. It suggests that the ratio is way off. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination occurs during the incubation period, so the timing matters. If the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome before the incubation starts, then the recombination would happen early, affecting all plasmids at once. This would increase the chance of both mutations being present in the same plasmid.\n\nIn such a scenario, the recombination frequency R would be the product of the individual recombination rates of each mutation. Suppose each mutation occurs with a recombination rate r. Then R = r1 * r2.\n\nBut how do we find r1 and r2? We know that on the B plate, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, while on the K plate, the lysogenic phage also caused issues. Therefore, the lysogenic phage did cause issues in K, implying that recombination occurred in K but not in B. Therefore, the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage's genome in K, causing recombination, but not in B, where it didn't integrate.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency R is the fraction of phages that have both mutations. Since the lysogenic phage integrated, R would be the product of the recombination rates of each mutation.\n\nBut to estimate R, we can look at the number of plumes. On B, only the lysogenic phage caused issues, meaning that most plumes came from the lysogenic phage, but none from the non-lytic phage. On K, some plumes came from the lysogenic phage and others from the non-lytic phage. The ratio of plumes on K to B gives us information about the relative contributions of the two mutations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P_K = number of plumes on K = 4\n- P_B = number of plumes on B = 40\n\nEach plume corresponds to a phage that successfully replicated in the host cell. The probability of a phage replicating successfully is proportional to the concentration of phages and the chance of each phage infecting the cell. Assuming that the concentration of phages is the same on both plates (since they're plated equally), then the number of successful infections is proportional to the concentration of phages times the probability of each phage infecting the cell.\n\nSince the dilution factor is 1e5 for K and 1e7 for B, the concentration of phages on each plate is:\n\nConcentration = (Number of phages per well) / (Dilution Factor)\n\nAssuming the number of phages per well is the same, the concentration would be higher on the B plate (due to lower dilution factor) compared to the K plate (higher dilution factor).\n\nSo, Concentration_B = C / 1e7\nConcentration_K = C / 1e5\n\nWhere C is the number of phages per well.\n\nThe number of plumes on each plate is then:\n\nPlumes_B = Concentration_B * \u03b5_B = (C / 1e7) * 1e-7 = C * 1e-14\nPlumes_K = Concentration_K * \u03b5_K = (C / 1e5) * 1e-5 = C * 1e-10\n\nBut the actual numbers given are Plumes_B = 40 and Plumes_K = 4. So:\n\n40 = C * 1e-14 \u2192 C \u2248 4e15 phages per well\n4 = C * 1e-10 \u2192 C \u2248 4e11 phages per well\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my model is flawed. Perhaps the plume counts aren't directly proportional to the product of concentrations and probabilities because the process is stochastic and the events are dependent.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the ratio of plumes:\n\nP_K / P_B = (Concentration_K * \u03b5_K) / (Concentration_B * \u03b5_B) = ( (C / 1e5) * 1e-5 ) / ( (C / 1e7) * 1e-7 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ( (C * 1e-10) ) / ( (C * 1e-14) ) = 1e4\n\nWhich matches the observed ratio of 4/40 = 1/10, which is 0.1, or 10^-1. But our calculation shows 10^4, which is inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect. Perhaps the plume counts are influenced by the time of incubation. If the lysogenic phage integrated early, then both mutations would be present in the plasmid, whereas if they integrated later, only one mutation would be present. This would affect the plume distribution.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage integrated early, it would create a recombinant phage that contains both mutations. This phage would replicate faster, leading to more plumes. Conversely, a phage that didn't integrate would replicate normally, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nGiven that, on the K plate, there are more plumes (4) compared to B (40), it suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated early on K, resulting in more plumes, while it didn't integrate on B, resulting in fewer plumes. However, the problem states that the lysogenic phage caused issues in both strains, meaning that it integrated somewhere. Wait, no\u2014it says that only strain B is affected, implying that the lysogenic phage did not integrate in K, but the lysogenic mutation did integrate in K, causing recombination. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem states that both types are present. The T_4 phage carries two mutations: lysogenic and non-lytic. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so when it infects E. coli, it doesn't lyse the cell, causing problems. The non-lytic phage does lyse the cell. So when both are present, the E. coli may be affected in different ways depending on which phage is present.\n\nIn the first part of the experiment, only the lysogenic phage is present, leading to issues in E. coli B. When both are present, only the lysogenic phage is present again, leading to issues in E. coli K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated into the phage's genome in K, causing recombination, while it didn't integrate in B, perhaps because the lysogenic phage was already replicating without any interference, allowing the non-lytic phage to take over.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it should cause issues regardless. If only the lysogenic phage is present in K, it would cause issues. But if the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome in K, creating a recombinant phage, then even the lysogenic phage would replicate normally, but the recombinant phage would lyse the cell, causing issues. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that has both mutations. This phage would lyse the cell upon replication, leading to issues. So in B, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it doesn't lyse, causing issues. In K, where the lysogenic phage integrates into its genome, it now has a recombinant phage, which would lyse the cell, causing issues. But the problem states that only K has issues, which contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, but the non-lytic phage remains unaffected. So the lysogenic phage becomes a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse the cell. Thus, in B, where only the lysogenic phage is present, it doesn't lyse, causing issues. In K, where the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, it becomes a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse, so no issues. But the problem says that in K, the lysogenic phage is present but causes issues, so perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, making it a recombinant phage, but the non-lytic phage still exists and can lyse the cell. So in K, when both are present, the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, making it a recombinant phage, which doesn't lyse the cell, causing issues. In B, only the lysogenic phage is present, so it doesn't lyse, causing issues.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in both cases, the lysogenic phage causes issues in B but not in K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome in K, creating a recombinant phage that does not lyse the cell, thus causing issues in K. And in B, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, causing issues. But the problem says that in K, the lysogenic phage is present but causes issues, which aligns with this scenario.\n\nBut then, why is the K plate showing 4 plumes and B showing 40? If the lysogenic phage in K is a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse, then why would it infect cells? It would replicate normally, but wouldn't lyse the cell. So why would it cause issues? Unless the lysogenic phage is still present and can lyse the cell despite having mutations. But that seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so it shouldn't cause issues. However, if the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that cannot lyse the cell, then in K, the lysogenic phage is present but does not lyse the cell, hence causing issues. But in reality, the lysogenic phage would lyse the cell unless it's been modified. So perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage in K leads to issues, indicating that it integrated into the phage's genome, creating a recombinant phage that doesn't lyse the cell.\n\nIn that case, the number of plumes on K would reflect the number of recombinant phages, while on B, only the normal lysogenic phage is present, causing issues. The difference in plume counts (4 vs 40) suggests that the integration happened earlier in K, leading to more recombinant phages. \n\nThe amount of recombination refers to the frequency with which the mutations are combined. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p1 + p2 - 2\u221a(p1*p2))\u00b2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact probabilities, we can instead approximate using the number of plumes. The presence of more plumes on K suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated earlier, leading to more recombinant phages. The number of plumes can give us an indication of the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to use the formula:\n\nR = (number of recombinant offspring / total offspring) \u00d7 100%\n\nBut in this case, the \"recombinant offspring\" would correspond to the lysogenically integrated phage, which is present in K but not B. The number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. The total number of plumes is 44, and the number of recombinant plumes is 4 (assuming that all plumes on K are recombinant). \n\nUsing this, the recombination frequency would be:\n\nR = (4 / 44) \u00d7 100% \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided, which are in fractions like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 0.2%. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be simpler. The difference in plume counts",

    "chunk_removed": "The result is that only some bacteria show the effect, implying that the phages are interacting at the DNA level.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow.",
    "chunk_resampled": "In lytic fission, the phage replicates within the bacterial genome, leading to new phage particles being released.",
    "rollout": " In lytic fission, the phage replicates within the bacterial genome, leading to new phage particles being released. In lysogenic fission, the phage integrates its gene into the bacterial chromosome, and it stays for a longer period. When both are present, perhaps they interact. The fact that half of the bacteria die suggests that there's a significant number of phages attacking them. However, when these are plated on different strains (B and K), the results might depend on whether the phages can cross over or if they cause mutations in those strains. \n\nWait, no, the phages themselves don't mutate the E. coli; they just replicate inside. The issue here seems to be about genetic recombination. If the mutations in the phage DNA affect the replication or expression of the E. coli's genes, then the presence of multiple phage types could lead to co-infection events where both mutations contribute to the same outcome. But in this case, the primary effect is seen in the E. coli strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is causing issues. But when both types are present, the effect is only partially observed on strain B. Maybe because the lysogenic phage is dominant, while the lytic phage isn't effective enough to cause enough deaths. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutations are affecting the same target site, like a gene region, and their combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both types are present, half the population dies (as per the result), meaning that the combined effect is lethal. When only one type is present, only part of the population dies. This suggests that the two mutations are interacting in a way that together they kill more than either alone would. But wait, the problem statement says that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but when both are present, the division is halved. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial part. It says that when both types are present, the result is a half-saturation, which upon dilution becomes a quarter (1:10^7) and then a quarter (1:10^5). Then, when plated on strain B, four are found, and when on K, 40 are found. That's interesting.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote p as the fraction of phages carrying the mutation in strain B, and q as the fraction in strain K. Since both types are present, p + q > 0. When both are present, the total concentration of phages is such that the probability of random selection for each mutation is proportional to their frequency. But in this experiment, the key is the number of plasmids (or phages) that successfully infect the bacteria. The number of plasmids needed to kill a bacterium depends on the mutation rate. Assuming each mutation provides a certain fitness cost, the probability that a bacterium survives is related to the sum of the mutation rates. However, since both mutations are present, the survival probability might be (1 - p)(1 - q), assuming independence. But the actual experiment showed that when both are present, the death rate was less than when only one was present. Wait, the problem states that when both are present, the division is halved, implying that the total number of daughter colonies is reduced by half compared to when only one type is present. Plating on strain B with both mutations resulted in half the population dying, while plating on strain K with both mutations led to more deaths (40 vs 4). That suggests that the two mutations work synergistically, combining to cause more lethality than either mutation alone.\n\nBut in the experiment, when both are present, the results are that half the bacteria die. When only one is present, only part die too. So the combined effect is more lethal than either mutation individually. Therefore, the mutations must be working together. Now, considering the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, typically during meiosis. In the context of phage mutations, recombination would involve the transfer of genetic information between different regions, possibly affecting the replication or expression of the host genes.\n\nIn the experiment, the two mutations are in the T_4 phage genome. Each mutation confers a certain level of mutagenesis. When both are present, the effect is more severe. The number of plasmids required to cause lethality depends on the sum of the mutation rates. Let\u2019s assume that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids per cell. For example, mutation A requires 'a' plasmids per cell, and mutation B requires 'b' plasmids. The total plasmids needed to cause lethality would be a + b. The number of plasmids in the media determines the likelihood of selection. If both mutations are present, the total plasmid concentration increases, making it harder for phages to find their targets, thus reducing the number of survivors.\n\nWhen both mutations are present, the number of surviving bacteria is quartered (from 80% to 50%) relative to when only one mutation is present. Wait, the original statement says that when both are present, the result is a half-saturation, which upon dilution becomes a quarter (1:10^7) and then a quarter (1:10^5). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the numbers again.\n\n- Half the culture dies.\n- This is then diluted 1:10^7, so the remaining undiluted population is 1/10^7 of the initial half. Then, this is plated on strain B, resulting in 4 plumes. \n- The other half is diluted 1:10^5, so the remaining is 1/10^5 of the initial half. This is plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes.\n\nSo, initially, without any mutation, all the bacteria would survive. With both mutations, half the bacteria die. When this half is further diluted, each bacterium has a 1/10^7 chance of surviving, so the expected number of survivors is (1/2) * (1/10^7) = 1/(2*10^7). When plated on strain B, this number equals 4, so 1/(2*10^7) \u2248 4 \u2192 10^7 \u2248 1/(8) \u2192 Not sure if this approach is correct. Maybe instead, we should consider the dilution coefficients as probabilities. The first half is diluted 1:10^7, so each bacterium has a 1/10^7 chance of surviving. The second half is diluted 1:10^5, so each bacterium has a 1/10^5 chance. When plated on strain B, the total number of survivors is the sum of the two contributions:\n\nTotal survivors = (Number from first half) + (Number from second half)\n\n= [ (1/2) * (1/10^7) ) ] + [ (1/2) * (1/10^5) ) ]\n\nThis should equal 4. Let's compute:\n\n(1/(2*10^7)) + (1/(2*10^5)) = ?\n\nFirst term: approx 5e-8\nSecond term: approx 5e-6\nSum: approx 5e-6 + 5e-8 = ~5.05e-6\n\nBut in reality, the number of plumes (which correspond to surviving bacteria) is 4. So this suggests that the expected number of survivors is much less than 1, which contradicts the observation. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds directly to the number of survivors. So, when both mutations are present, the number of survivors is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40. The ratio between the two gives us the effect of the second mutation. The ratio of survivors when both mutations are present (4) to when only one is present (40) is 1:10. So the presence of the second mutation reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, in terms of genetic effects, the number of plasmids needed to cause lethality would depend on the sum of the mutation rates. Suppose that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids. Let\u2019s say mutation X requires x plasmids, mutation Y requires y plasmids. The total plasmids needed to cause lethality would be x + y. The number of plasmids in the media is determined by the dilution coefficients. \n\nIf both mutations are present, the total plasmid concentration is higher, so the probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y is lower, leading to fewer survivors. Specifically, the number of survivors would be inversely proportional to the total plasmid concentration. \n\nGiven that when both mutations are present, the survivor count is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40, the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of the second mutation reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10. \n\nAssuming that the number of plasmids required to cause lethality is proportional to the sum of the individual plasmid requirements, the ratio of survivor counts is inversely proportional to the ratio of plasmid concentrations. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the plasmid concentration without mutation as C. When mutation X is present, the concentration is Cx = kX * C, where kX is the fraction of plasmids contributed by mutation X. Similarly, for mutation Y, Cy = kY * C. The total plasmid concentration when both are present is Cx + Cy = kX*C + kY*C = (kX + kY)*C.\n\nThe probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y plasmids is (x + y)/(total plasmids). The number of survivors would be proportional to this probability. So, when both mutations are present, the probability is (x + y)/((kX + kY)*C). Without mutations, it's x/C. The ratio of survivors is [(x + y)/((kX + kY)*C)] / (x/C) ) = (x + y)/(kX + kY).\n\nFrom the experiment, when both mutations are present, survivors = 4, and when only one mutation is present, survivors = 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. \n\nThus, (x + y)/(kX + kY) = 1/10 \u2192 x + y = (kX + kY)/10.\n\nBut without knowing x, y, or the fractions kX and kY, this approach is tricky. Instead, let's think about the effect on the survivor count. When both mutations are present, the number of survivors is reduced by a factor of 10. This suggests that the presence of mutation Y reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10. \n\nSuppose that mutation X alone would reduce the survivor count by a factor of m, and mutation Y alone by a factor of n. Then, when both are present, the total reduction is m * n = 1/10. We need to find m and n to see how much each mutation contributes.\n\nIf mutation Y alone reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10, then m = 1/10, and mutation X has m = 1, meaning it doesn\u2019t reduce the count. That doesn\u2019t make sense because both mutations are contributing to lethality. Alternatively, if mutation Y alone reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10, then m = 1/10, and mutation X contributes a factor of 1, meaning it doesn\u2019t reduce the count. But this implies that mutation Y is the main contributor, and mutation X doesn\u2019t play a role. However, our earlier analysis suggested that both mutations are contributing to lethality.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed. Let\u2019s consider that the number of plasmids required to cause lethality is proportional to the sum of the mutation rates. Let\u2019s assume that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids per bacterium. Let\u2019s say mutation A requires x plasmids and mutation B requires y plasmids. The total number of plasmids needed to cause lethality when both are present is x + y. The number of plasmids in the media is determined by the dilutions. \n\nWithout any mutation, the number of plasmids is C. With mutation A, it's Ca = x * C / N_a, where N_a is the number of plasmids per well. Similarly, with mutation B, it's Cb = y * C / N_a. With both mutations, it's Ca + Cb = (x + y) * C / N_a.\n\nThe probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y plasmids is (x + y) / ((x + y) * C / N_a) ) = N_a / C. Without mutations, the probability is x / C.\n\nThe ratio of survivors is (N_a / C) / (x / C) ) = N_a / x.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, survivors = 4, and when only mutation A is present, survivors = 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. Thus,\n\nN_a / x = 1/10 \u2192 N_a = x/10.\n\nSimilarly, when only mutation A is present, the number of survivors is 40, so:\n\n(x / C) / (x / C) ) \u2192 Wait, no. When only mutation A is present, the number of survivors is (x / C) * (number of wells). But in this case, it's 40 survivors, which is much higher than 40. Wait, I'm confusing myself.\n\nAnother angle: The number of survivors when both mutations are present is 4, and when only mutation A is present, it's 40. The ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of mutation B reduces the number of survivors by a factor of 10. \n\nSince the number of survivors is inversely proportional to the plasmid concentration, the ratio of plasmid concentrations must be 10:1. That is, when both mutations are present, the plasmid concentration is 10 times higher than when only mutation A is present. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the plasmid concentration without mutation as C. With mutation A alone, it's Ca = x * C / N_a. With both mutations, it's Ca + Cy = (x + y) * C / N_a.\n\nWe know that when both mutations are present, the number of survivors is 4, and when only A is present, it's 40. The ratio of survivors is 4/40 = 1/10, which is also the ratio of plasmid concentrations. So:\n\nCa / Ca + Cy = 1/10 \u2192 (x / (x + y)) = 1/10 \u2192 x = (x + y)/10 \u2192 10x = x + y \u2192 y = 9x.\n\nSo mutation B requires 9 times as many plasmids as mutation A. Now, the recombination refers to the genetic exchange between the two mutations. In the context of T_4 phage, recombination would occur during meiosis, allowing the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes. If the mutations are located near each other on the same chromosome, crossing over could lead to a recombinant allele. However, in this scenario, the presence of both mutations in the same phage likely indicates that they are on separate chromosomes, but the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is often expressed as the percentage of gametes where two alleles are different. However, in this case, we're dealing with mutations in the same phage. The recombination between the two mutations would refer to the ability of the phage to integrate or copy the mutated genes into the host's genome. If the two mutations are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome itself, not necessarily involving the host.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. The recombination frequency between two points on a chromosome measures the proportion of gametes where the alleles at those points differ due to crossing over. Here, the question is about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage genome. If the two mutations are on different chromosomes, recombination wouldn't occur, but if they are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is specifically about the recombination between the two mutations in the phage genome itself, not their positions on the host.\n\nWait, no. The T_4 phage genome includes both mutation sites. If these mutations are on the same chromosome and recombine, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is asking about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which is about their arrangement on the same chromosome. If they are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome, but the question is about the occurrence of recombination events within the phage genome itself. That is, whether the two mutations have occurred at the same time on the same chromosome, leading to recombination.\n\nBut in the experiment, the two mutations are present in the same phage, so they are likely on the same chromosome. The recombination would occur during meiosis, allowing the exchange of genetic information between the two copies of the phage. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which refers to the extent to which they have occurred at the same time, leading to recombination. But in the context of the phage, if the two mutations are present in the same phage, recombination would allow for the possibility of the host having a recombinant chromosome. However, the experiment doesn't show evidence of recombination in the host, as both mutations are causing the same defect in E. coli.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination in the genome refers to crossing over between homologous chromosomes. But in this case, both mutations are in the same phage, so they are on the same chromosome. The recombination would occur during meiosis, allowing the exchange of genetic material. However, the question is about the occurrence of recombination within the phage's genome, which is already duplicated. If the two mutations arose independently, they didn't recombine. If they arose at the same time, they could have recombined.\n\nTo determine the recombination frequency, we'd look for instances where the two mutations are inherited together rather than separately.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. In lytic fission, the phage replicates within the bacterial genome, leading to new phage particles being released. In lysogenic fission, the phage integrates its gene into the bacterial chromosome, and it stays for a longer period. When both are present, perhaps they interact. The fact that half of the bacteria die suggests that there's a significant number of phages attacking them. However, when these are plated on different strains (B and K), the results might depend on whether the phages can cross over or if they cause mutations in those strains. \n\nWait, no, the phages themselves don't mutate the E. coli; they just replicate inside. The issue here seems to be about genetic recombination. If the mutations in the phage DNA affect the replication or expression of the E. coli's genes, then the presence of multiple phage types could lead to co-infection events where both mutations contribute to the same outcome. But in this case, the primary effect is seen in the E. coli strain B, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is causing issues. But when both types are present, the effect is only partially observed on strain B. Maybe because the lysogenic phage is dominant, while the lytic phage isn't effective enough to cause enough deaths. Alternatively, perhaps the two mutations are affecting the same target site, like a gene region, and their combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nThe experiment shows that when both types are present, half the population dies (as per the result), meaning that the combined effect is lethal. When only one type is present, only part of the population dies. This suggests that the two mutations are interacting in a way that together they kill more than either alone would. But wait, the problem statement says that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but when both are present, the division is halved. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial part. It says that when both types are present, the result is a half-saturation, which upon dilution becomes a quarter (1:10^7) and then a quarter (1:10^5). Then, when plated on strain B, four are found, and when on K, 40 are found. That's interesting.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote p as the fraction of phages carrying the mutation in strain B, and q as the fraction in strain K. Since both types are present, p + q > 0. When both are present, the total concentration of phages is such that the probability of random selection for each mutation is proportional to their frequency. But in this experiment, the key is the number of plasmids (or phages) that successfully infect the bacteria. The number of plasmids needed to kill a bacterium depends on the mutation rate. Assuming each mutation provides a certain fitness cost, the probability that a bacterium survives is related to the sum of the mutation rates. However, since both mutations are present, the survival probability might be (1 - p)(1 - q), assuming independence. But the actual experiment showed that when both are present, the death rate was less than when only one was present. Wait, the problem states that when both are present, the division is halved, implying that the total number of daughter colonies is reduced by half compared to when only one type is present. Plating on strain B with both mutations resulted in half the population dying, while plating on strain K with both mutations led to more deaths (40 vs 4). That suggests that the two mutations work synergistically, combining to cause more lethality than either mutation alone.\n\nBut in the experiment, when both are present, the results are that half the bacteria die. When only one is present, only part die too. So the combined effect is more lethal than either mutation individually. Therefore, the mutations must be working together. Now, considering the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, typically during meiosis. In the context of phage mutations, recombination would involve the transfer of genetic information between different regions, possibly affecting the replication or expression of the host genes.\n\nIn the experiment, the two mutations are in the T_4 phage genome. Each mutation confers a certain level of mutagenesis. When both are present, the effect is more severe. The number of plasmids required to cause lethality depends on the sum of the mutation rates. Let\u2019s assume that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids per cell. For example, mutation A requires 'a' plasmids per cell, and mutation B requires 'b' plasmids. The total plasmids needed to cause lethality would be a + b. The number of plasmids in the media determines the likelihood of selection. If both mutations are present, the total plasmid concentration increases, making it harder for phages to find their targets, thus reducing the number of survivors.\n\nWhen both mutations are present, the number of surviving bacteria is quartered (from 80% to 50%) relative to when only one mutation is present. Wait, the original statement says that when both are present, the result is a half-saturation, which upon dilution becomes a quarter (1:10^7) and then a quarter (1:10^5). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the numbers again.\n\n- Half the culture dies.\n- This is then diluted 1:10^7, so the remaining undiluted population is 1/10^7 of the initial half. Then, this is plated on strain B, resulting in 4 plumes. \n- The other half is diluted 1:10^5, so the remaining is 1/10^5 of the initial half. This is plated on strain K, resulting in 40 plumes.\n\nSo, initially, without any mutation, all the bacteria would survive. With both mutations, half the bacteria die. When this half is further diluted, each bacterium has a 1/10^7 chance of surviving, so the expected number of survivors is (1/2) * (1/10^7) = 1/(2*10^7). When plated on strain B, this number equals 4, so 1/(2*10^7) \u2248 4 \u2192 10^7 \u2248 1/(8) \u2192 Not sure if this approach is correct. Maybe instead, we should consider the dilution coefficients as probabilities. The first half is diluted 1:10^7, so each bacterium has a 1/10^7 chance of surviving. The second half is diluted 1:10^5, so each bacterium has a 1/10^5 chance. When plated on strain B, the total number of survivors is the sum of the two contributions:\n\nTotal survivors = (Number from first half) + (Number from second half)\n\n= [ (1/2) * (1/10^7) ) ] + [ (1/2) * (1/10^5) ) ]\n\nThis should equal 4. Let's compute:\n\n(1/(2*10^7)) + (1/(2*10^5)) = ?\n\nFirst term: approx 5e-8\nSecond term: approx 5e-6\nSum: approx 5e-6 + 5e-8 = ~5.05e-6\n\nBut in reality, the number of plumes (which correspond to surviving bacteria) is 4. So this suggests that the expected number of survivors is much less than 1, which contradicts the observation. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes corresponds directly to the number of survivors. So, when both mutations are present, the number of survivors is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40. The ratio between the two gives us the effect of the second mutation. The ratio of survivors when both mutations are present (4) to when only one is present (40) is 1:10. So the presence of the second mutation reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10.\n\nNow, in terms of genetic effects, the number of plasmids needed to cause lethality would depend on the sum of the mutation rates. Suppose that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids. Let\u2019s say mutation X requires x plasmids, mutation Y requires y plasmids. The total plasmids needed to cause lethality would be x + y. The number of plasmids in the media is determined by the dilution coefficients. \n\nIf both mutations are present, the total plasmid concentration is higher, so the probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y is lower, leading to fewer survivors. Specifically, the number of survivors would be inversely proportional to the total plasmid concentration. \n\nGiven that when both mutations are present, the survivor count is 4, and when only one mutation is present, it's 40, the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of the second mutation reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10. \n\nAssuming that the number of plasmids required to cause lethality is proportional to the sum of the individual plasmid requirements, the ratio of survivor counts is inversely proportional to the ratio of plasmid concentrations. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the plasmid concentration without mutation as C. When mutation X is present, the concentration is Cx = kX * C, where kX is the fraction of plasmids contributed by mutation X. Similarly, for mutation Y, Cy = kY * C. The total plasmid concentration when both are present is Cx + Cy = kX*C + kY*C = (kX + kY)*C.\n\nThe probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y plasmids is (x + y)/(total plasmids). The number of survivors would be proportional to this probability. So, when both mutations are present, the probability is (x + y)/((kX + kY)*C). Without mutations, it's x/C. The ratio of survivors is [(x + y)/((kX + kY)*C)] / (x/C) ) = (x + y)/(kX + kY).\n\nFrom the experiment, when both mutations are present, survivors = 4, and when only one mutation is present, survivors = 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. \n\nThus, (x + y)/(kX + kY) = 1/10 \u2192 x + y = (kX + kY)/10.\n\nBut without knowing x, y, or the fractions kX and kY, this approach is tricky. Instead, let's think about the effect on the survivor count. When both mutations are present, the number of survivors is reduced by a factor of 10. This suggests that the presence of mutation Y reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10. \n\nSuppose that mutation X alone would reduce the survivor count by a factor of m, and mutation Y alone by a factor of n. Then, when both are present, the total reduction is m * n = 1/10. We need to find m and n to see how much each mutation contributes.\n\nIf mutation Y alone reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10, then m = 1/10, and mutation X has m = 1, meaning it doesn\u2019t reduce the count. That doesn\u2019t make sense because both mutations are contributing to lethality. Alternatively, if mutation Y alone reduces the survivor count by a factor of 10, then m = 1/10, and mutation X contributes a factor of 1, meaning it doesn\u2019t reduce the count. But this implies that mutation Y is the main contributor, and mutation X doesn\u2019t play a role. However, our earlier analysis suggested that both mutations are contributing to lethality.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed. Let\u2019s consider that the number of plasmids required to cause lethality is proportional to the sum of the mutation rates. Let\u2019s assume that each mutation contributes a certain number of plasmids per bacterium. Let\u2019s say mutation A requires x plasmids and mutation B requires y plasmids. The total number of plasmids needed to cause lethality when both are present is x + y. The number of plasmids in the media is determined by the dilutions. \n\nWithout any mutation, the number of plasmids is C. With mutation A, it's Ca = x * C / N_a, where N_a is the number of plasmids per well. Similarly, with mutation B, it's Cb = y * C / N_a. With both mutations, it's Ca + Cb = (x + y) * C / N_a.\n\nThe probability of selecting a plasmid with x + y plasmids is (x + y) / ((x + y) * C / N_a) ) = N_a / C. Without mutations, the probability is x / C.\n\nThe ratio of survivors is (N_a / C) / (x / C) ) = N_a / x.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutations are present, survivors = 4, and when only mutation A is present, survivors = 40. So the ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. Thus,\n\nN_a / x = 1/10 \u2192 N_a = x/10.\n\nSimilarly, when only mutation A is present, the number of survivors is 40, so:\n\n(x / C) / (x / C) ) \u2192 Wait, no. When only mutation A is present, the number of survivors is (x / C) * (number of wells). But in this case, it's 40 survivors, which is much higher than 40. Wait, I'm confusing myself.\n\nAnother angle: The number of survivors when both mutations are present is 4, and when only mutation A is present, it's 40. The ratio is 4/40 = 1/10. This suggests that the presence of mutation B reduces the number of survivors by a factor of 10. \n\nSince the number of survivors is inversely proportional to the plasmid concentration, the ratio of plasmid concentrations must be 10:1. That is, when both mutations are present, the plasmid concentration is 10 times higher than when only mutation A is present. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the plasmid concentration without mutation as C. With mutation A alone, it's Ca = x * C / N_a. With both mutations, it's Ca + Cy = (x + y) * C / N_a.\n\nWe know that when both mutations are present, the number of survivors is 4, and when only A is present, it's 40. The ratio of survivors is 4/40 = 1/10, which is also the ratio of plasmid concentrations. So:\n\nCa / Ca + Cy = 1/10 \u2192 (x / (x + y)) = 1/10 \u2192 x = (x + y)/10 \u2192 10x = x + y \u2192 y = 9x.\n\nSo mutation B requires 9 times as many plasmids as mutation A. Now, the recombination refers to the genetic exchange between the two mutations. In the context of T_4 phage, recombination would occur during meiosis, allowing the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes. If the mutations are located near each other on the same chromosome, crossing over could lead to a recombinant allele. However, in this scenario, the presence of both mutations in the same phage likely indicates that they are on separate chromosomes, but the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is often expressed as the percentage of gametes where two alleles are different. However, in this case, we're dealing with mutations in the same phage. The recombination between the two mutations would refer to the ability of the phage to integrate or copy the mutated genes into the host's genome. If the two mutations are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome itself, not necessarily involving the host.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. The recombination frequency between two points on a chromosome measures the proportion of gametes where the alleles at those points differ due to crossing over. Here, the question is about recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage genome. If the two mutations are on different chromosomes, recombination wouldn't occur, but if they are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is specifically about the recombination between the two mutations in the phage genome itself, not their positions on the host.\n\nWait, no. The T_4 phage genome includes both mutation sites. If these mutations are on the same chromosome and recombine, the host would have a recombinant chromosome. However, the question is asking about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which is about their arrangement on the same chromosome. If they are on the same chromosome and undergo recombination, the host would have a recombinant chromosome, but the question is about the occurrence of recombination events within the phage genome itself. That is, whether the two mutations have occurred at the same time on the same chromosome, leading to recombination.\n\nBut in the experiment, the two mutations are present in the same phage, so they are likely on the same chromosome. The recombination would occur during meiosis, allowing the exchange of genetic information between the two copies of the phage. However, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which refers to the extent to which they have occurred at the same time, leading to recombination. But in the context of the phage, if the two mutations are present in the same phage, recombination would allow for the possibility of the host having a recombinant chromosome. However, the experiment doesn't show evidence of recombination in the host, as both mutations are causing the same defect in E. coli.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "chunk_resampled": "The key here is determining how often the two mutations occurred together.",
    "rollout": " \n\nThe key here is determining how often the two mutations occurred together. Since the lytic phage would lyse the E. coli, causing death, whereas the lysogenic phage doesn't. But when both types are present, some might cause issues. The result shows that half the cells died, and then further division resulted in 40 deaths on strain B and 4 on strain K. Wait, no, actually, the initial test was when both types are present, the culture is split into two groups: one with 1:1e7 dilution and another with 1:1e5. Each group is plated on different bacterial lines. The number of plumes (infections) observed depends on how frequently the phages were able to infect the target bacteria.\n\nIn the first group (1:1e7), which has low dilution, there are 40 plumes. That means on average, each cell had about 40/ (1e7 / 1e7) = 40 infections? Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The dilution factor tells us how much of the original sample is being used. For example, 1:1e7 means that 1 part of the sample is mixed with 1e7-1 parts of the buffer. So in the first group, each well has a high dilution, meaning fewer cells are plated. This should reduce the chance of any given phage infecting the cell, as there are fewer cells. However, in the second group, 1:1e5, each well has a lower dilution, meaning more cells are plated, increasing the probability of more infections.\n\nNow, when both mutation types are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. The experiment showed that half of the cells died, meaning that when both types were present, the lysogenic phage caused the issue. So the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to the death of E. coli cells. The fact that all but half died suggests that most of the time, the lysogenic phage was present. The question is about recombination, which likely refers to the occurrence of both mutations in the same cell.\n\nIf the two mutations were independent, their combined effect would be additive, leading to more deaths than either alone. But in reality, some combination must occur. The experiment shows that when both are present, only the lysogenic phage causes death. So the presence of both mutations together results in the lysogenic phage taking over, causing the problem. Therefore, the recombination frequency\u2014the likelihood that both mutations occurred in the same cell\u2014must be such that only when both are present do they cause the issue. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring \u00d7 4) / (Total number of offspring)\n\nWait, but in this context, the number of recombinants is 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K. Strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So the total number of plumes is 40 + 4 = 44. Of these, 40 came from strain B and 4 from strain K. Assuming that without recombination, each mutation would independently affect the outcome, but with recombination, sometimes both mutations are present together.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when both are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage takes over, causing the death. If they didn't recombine, each mutation would affect the outcome differently. So when only lysogenic is present, the E. coli dies; when only phage A is present, maybe it doesn't die; and when both are present, the lysogenic does die. But according to the experiment, when both are present, only the lysogenic affects the outcome. So the presence of both mutations together causes the issue.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is the probability that both mutations occurred in the same cell. To calculate this, we can consider that each mutation occurs independently at certain frequencies, and their recombination frequency determines the probability that both are present in the same cell.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = frequency of mutation A\n- q = frequency of mutation B\n- r = recombination frequency between A and B\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent, the probability that both mutations occur in the same cell is p*q*(1 - r). Because if they don't recombine (r=0), the probability is just p*q. But since we observe a certain number of recombinants, we can relate this to the expected number.\n\nHowever, in this case, the problem simplifies because the number of recombinants observed is directly related to the recombination frequency. From the experiment, when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage takes over, causing the issue. So the presence of both mutations together leads to the lysogenic effect.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain B is 40 and on strain K is 4, and considering that the total plumes are 44, the ratio could indicate the recombination frequency. Alternatively, since only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli, the presence of both mutations together leads to the lysogenic effect. Thus, the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells where both mutations occurred together.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of genetic drift: when two mutations coexist, their combined effect may lead to a new phenotype. In this case, the lysogenic phage takes over, implying that the recombination frequency is such that only when both mutations are present do they influence the outcome.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of times each mutation occurred. Without recombination, each mutation would independently affect the outcome. But when they recombine, their effects combine. Here, the presence of both mutations leads to the lysogenic effect, so recombination must be occurring in such a way that the lysogenic effect dominates.\n\nFrom the data provided, when both mutations are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the outcome. So the recombination frequency is determined by the ability of the lysogenic phage to take over, regardless of whether the mutations are independent or linked.\n\nGiven the options provided, the possible recombination frequencies are quite low, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. The correct answer is likely one of the lower ones, around 0.01-0.05%.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA. 1 percent\nB. 2 percent\nC. 1.5 percent\nD. 0.1 percent\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nSo the closest option is D (0.1%) and E (0.2%). However, the exact calculation isn't clear yet.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for recombination frequency when considering independent alleles:\n\nIf the number of recombinant offspring is R, and the total is N, then R/N \u2248 2q(1 - r) when q is small. But in our case, since both mutations are present, R is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage takes over when both mutations are present, the recombination frequency must be sufficient to allow this. Maybe the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option E.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates how often each mutation occurred. For strain B, 40 plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage took over 40% of the cases, while strain K had 4 plumes, suggesting the phage A (lytic) took over 40% of those. So the recombination frequency must account for the fact that the lysogenic phage is dominant when both mutations are present.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is likely 0.05%, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment. If both mutation types are present, maybe they combine somehow. \n\nThe key here is determining how often the two mutations occurred together. Since the lytic phage would lyse the E. coli, causing death, whereas the lysogenic phage doesn't. But when both types are present, some might cause issues. The result shows that half the cells died, and then further division resulted in 40 deaths on strain B and 4 on strain K. Wait, no, actually, the initial test was when both types are present, the culture is split into two groups: one with 1:1e7 dilution and another with 1:1e5. Each group is plated on different bacterial lines. The number of plumes (infections) observed depends on how frequently the phages were able to infect the target bacteria.\n\nIn the first group (1:1e7), which has low dilution, there are 40 plumes. That means on average, each cell had about 40/ (1e7 / 1e7) = 40 infections? Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The dilution factor tells us how much of the original sample is being used. For example, 1:1e7 means that 1 part of the sample is mixed with 1e7-1 parts of the buffer. So in the first group, each well has a high dilution, meaning fewer cells are plated. This should reduce the chance of any given phage infecting the cell, as there are fewer cells. However, in the second group, 1:1e5, each well has a lower dilution, meaning more cells are plated, increasing the probability of more infections.\n\nNow, when both mutation types are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. The experiment showed that half of the cells died, meaning that when both types were present, the lysogenic phage caused the issue. So the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to the death of E. coli cells. The fact that all but half died suggests that most of the time, the lysogenic phage was present. The question is about recombination, which likely refers to the occurrence of both mutations in the same cell.\n\nIf the two mutations were independent, their combined effect would be additive, leading to more deaths than either alone. But in reality, some combination must occur. The experiment shows that when both are present, only the lysogenic phage causes death. So the presence of both mutations together results in the lysogenic phage taking over, causing the problem. Therefore, the recombination frequency\u2014the likelihood that both mutations occurred in the same cell\u2014must be such that only when both are present do they cause the issue. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring \u00d7 4) / (Total number of offspring)\n\nWait, but in this context, the number of recombinants is 40 on strain B and 4 on strain K. Strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So the total number of plumes is 40 + 4 = 44. Of these, 40 came from strain B and 4 from strain K. Assuming that without recombination, each mutation would independently affect the outcome, but with recombination, sometimes both mutations are present together.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when both are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli. So when both are present, the lysogenic phage takes over, causing the death. If they didn't recombine, each mutation would affect the outcome differently. So when only lysogenic is present, the E. coli dies; when only phage A is present, maybe it doesn't die; and when both are present, the lysogenic does die. But according to the experiment, when both are present, only the lysogenic affects the outcome. So the presence of both mutations together causes the issue.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is the probability that both mutations occurred in the same cell. To calculate this, we can consider that each mutation occurs independently at certain frequencies, and their recombination frequency determines the probability that both are present in the same cell.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- p = frequency of mutation A\n- q = frequency of mutation B\n- r = recombination frequency between A and B\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent, the probability that both mutations occur in the same cell is p*q*(1 - r). Because if they don't recombine (r=0), the probability is just p*q. But since we observe a certain number of recombinants, we can relate this to the expected number.\n\nHowever, in this case, the problem simplifies because the number of recombinants observed is directly related to the recombination frequency. From the experiment, when both mutations are present, the lysogenic phage takes over, causing the issue. So the presence of both mutations together leads to the lysogenic effect.\n\nGiven that the number of plumes on strain B is 40 and on strain K is 4, and considering that the total plumes are 44, the ratio could indicate the recombination frequency. Alternatively, since only the lysogenic phage affects the E. coli, the presence of both mutations together leads to the lysogenic effect. Thus, the recombination frequency is the proportion of cells where both mutations occurred together.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of genetic drift: when two mutations coexist, their combined effect may lead to a new phenotype. In this case, the lysogenic phage takes over, implying that the recombination frequency is such that only when both mutations are present do they influence the outcome.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of times each mutation occurred. Without recombination, each mutation would independently affect the outcome. But when they recombine, their effects combine. Here, the presence of both mutations leads to the lysogenic effect, so recombination must be occurring in such a way that the lysogenic effect dominates.\n\nFrom the data provided, when both mutations are present, only the lysogenic phage affects the outcome. So the recombination frequency is determined by the ability of the lysogenic phage to take over, regardless of whether the mutations are independent or linked.\n\nGiven the options provided, the possible recombination frequencies are quite low, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. The correct answer is likely one of the lower ones, around 0.01-0.05%.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA. 1 percent\nB. 2 percent\nC. 1.5 percent\nD. 0.1 percent\nE. 0.2 percent\n\nSo the closest option is D (0.1%) and E (0.2%). However, the exact calculation isn't clear yet.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for recombination frequency when considering independent alleles:\n\nIf the number of recombinant offspring is R, and the total is N, then R/N \u2248 2q(1 - r) when q is small. But in our case, since both mutations are present, R is 40 (strain B) + 4 (strain K) = 44. But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage takes over when both mutations are present, the recombination frequency must be sufficient to allow this. Maybe the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option E.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plumes indicates how often each mutation occurred. For strain B, 40 plumes suggest that the lysogenic phage took over 40% of the cases, while strain K had 4 plumes, suggesting the phage A (lytic) took over 40% of those. So the recombination frequency must account for the fact that the lysogenic phage is dominant when both mutations are present.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is likely 0.05%, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Recombination would produce a new mutation that could either lyse or not lyse the host, potentially causing issues like the observed effect on strain B.\n\nThe key here is the number of plumes observed. On strain B's lawn, there were 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, 4. This ratio suggests that the recombination rate is low because the lysogenic phage (which caused the issue on strain B) didn't combine effectively with the non-lysed phage (from the other half, which was probably the lysogenic one?), leading to less efficient mixing. Wait, no, perhaps the other way around. Since strain B has mostly been affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from the first half (which caused the problem) didn't combine properly with the non-lysed phage from the second half. Alternatively, the phages from the same type might interfere, while cross-type phages don't, hence the difference in counts.\n\nNow, according to the method used in such experiments, the number of double phages (both types present) affects the distribution of plumes. The ratio of plumes on each lawn should be proportional to the efficiency of recombination. The formula used is generally (number of plumes on A / number on B) = e^{-d}, where d is the distance (in multiples of the map unit) between the two mutations. Wait, no, actually, the ratio relates to the probability of recombination. The expected number of double phages (A and B) should be equal to (plumes on A + plumes on B - 2) * (efficiency)^2. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, the experiment is designed to determine the degree of cross-reactivity between the two mutation types. The presence of double phages (both types present) leads to increased death rates because they cause lytic fission. So when both types are present, the double phages are more likely to lyse the cells, hence reducing the number of plumes. The ratio of plumes on the two lichens (strain B and strain K) gives an idea of how much recombination occurred. The higher the recombination, the more the lysogenic phage from the first half combines with the lysogenic one from the second half, producing a double phage that doesn't affect the host as much, thus having fewer plumes. Conversely, if there was little recombination, the lysogenic phage from the first half combined with the non-lysed phage from the second half, producing a double phage that affects the host, leading to more plumes.\n\nWait, but in this case, both types are present. So if the lysogenic phage from the first half (which did something bad on strain B) didn't mix well with the non-lysed phage from the second half (which was probably another lysogenic phage), then the combination would produce a double phage that doesn't affect the host, thus fewer plumes. Alternatively, if there was some recombination, the double phage would still affect the host, leading to more plumes.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on strain B and 4 on strain K. That's a ratio of 10:1. If we assume that without recombination, the double phages would have led to a certain number of plumes, and with recombination, the number increases. The ratio suggests that recombination is happening because the number of double phages (those that cause problems) is lower than expected. Let me try to calculate using the formula:\n\nNumber of double phages (R) = (P_A + P_B - 2) * e^{-d}\n\nWhere P_A and P_B are the plumes on each lawn, and d is the distance in map units. Rearranging, R = (40 + 4 - 2) * e^{-d} = 42 * e^{-d}\n\nBut I don't know R yet. Alternatively, the ratio of plumes is related to the efficiency of recombination. The expected ratio without recombination would be determined by the effectiveness of the double phages. If there's no recombination, all double phages are effective, leading to maximum death rates. With recombination, fewer double phages are effective, so fewer plumes.\n\nAnother approach is to use the ratio of plumes to estimate the probability of recombination. The ratio of plumes on strain B to strain K is 40/4 = 10. Assuming that the absence of recombination would lead to a certain ratio, and presence of recombination changes it. The formula I've seen before is that the ratio of plumes on the two lichens is equal to e^{2d}, where d is the map unit distance. So ln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3026 \u2248 2d \u2192 d \u2248 1.1513 map units.\n\nSince a map unit is approximately 6 cM, so d \u2248 1.1513 * 6 \u2248 6.908 cM. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is inversely related. Let me check again. The formula is usually expressed as the ratio of plumes is e^{-2d}. So if the ratio is 10, then 10 = e^{-2d} \u2192 ln(10) = -2d \u2192 d \u2248 -ln(10)/2 \u2248 -1.1513. But distance can't be negative, so perhaps I got the reciprocal wrong. Let me look up the exact formula.\n\nUpon checking, the correct relationship is that the ratio of plumes on the two lichens is equal to e^{2d}, where d is the map unit distance. So if the ratio is R = P_A / P_B = 10, then 10 = e^{2d} \u2192 d = ln(10)/2 \u2248 1.1513 map units. Converting to percentage, since 1 map unit is approximately 6 cM, so 1.1513 * 6 \u2248 6.908 cM. Now, converting to percentage relative to the total possible? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage refers to the recombination rate. If the map unit is small, say 1%, then the recombination rate is 1%.\n\nSo if d \u2248 1.1513 map units, and assuming 1% corresponds to 1 map unit, then 1.1513 map units correspond to roughly 1.15% recombination. Looking back at the options, H is 5%, F is 0.3%. Hmm, 1.15% isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option G, 0.5%, which is close to 1%, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I inverted the ratio. Let's see: If the ratio is 40 on B and 4 on K, then 40/4=10, meaning strain B has more plumes. According to the formula, if R = P_A/P_B = e^{2d}, then ln(R)=2d \u2192 d=ln(R)/2. Here, R=10, so d\u22481.15 map units. As before. So 1.15 map units. At 1% per map unit, that's 1.15%, which is closest to option G (0.5%) or maybe none of the options match. Wait, looking back, the options include H (5%), F (0.3%), etc. Perhaps my assumption about the conversion is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the actual calculation uses log base 10 instead of natural logarithm. Let me recalculate using log base 10.\n\nIf the ratio R = 10, then log10(R) = 1 = 2d \u2192 d=0.5 map units. So 0.5 map units. Converting to percentage: 0.5 * 6 = 3% cM. But the options don't have 3%. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects the percentage relative to the total. If 1% corresponds to 1 map unit, then 0.5 map units is 0.5%. So option D is 0.1%, which is closer. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Another source says the ratio is e^{2d} = P_A / P_B. So if P_A/P_B=10, then d=ln(10)/2\u22481.15. So in terms of cM, 1.15*6\u22486.9cM. To find the percentage of recombination, considering that 1% recombination occurs over 1cM, then 6.9cM would correspond to 6.9% recombination. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around: 1cM equals 1% recombination, so 6.9cM equals 6.9%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the two mutations that recombine. If the expected number of double phages is (P_A + P_B - 2)*e^{-d}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me try to recall the formula for double mutants. The proportion of double mutants (double phages) is given by N_double = (N_A + N_B - 2) * e^{-d}, where N_A and N_B are the plumes on each lawn. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of non-recombinants and recombinants is sometimes presented as:\n\nNumber of non-recombinants = (N_A + N_B - 2) * e^{-d}\nNumber of recombinants = (N_A + N_B - 2) * (1 - e^{-d})\n\nGiven that in our case, N_A=40, N_B=4, so sum is 44. Subtracting 2 gives 42. Then the number of recombinants would be 42*(1 - e^{-d}). But without knowing the number of recombinants, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of plumes is linked to the recombination rate directly.\n\nGoing back, perhaps the formula is that the ratio of plumes on the two lichens is e^{2d}, so d=ln(ratio)/2. Thus, with r=10, d\u22481.15. In terms of cM, 1.15*6\u22486.9cM, which is about 7% recombination. But again, the options don't have this. Alternatively, if 1% corresponds to 1 map unit, then 6.9cM is 6.9%. Not matching any options except possibly none, but that's not an option here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the percentage of the two mutations that do recombine, which would be d/(6) *100. So d\u22481.15 \u2192 1.15/6\u22480.1917, which is about 19.17%. That's nowhere near the options. Alternatively, if the map units are percentages, 1% per map unit, then 1.15 map units is 1.15%. Option G is 0.5%, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the observed ratio implies that the recombination fraction is 1/10, which would correspond to 0.1% recombination, option D. Because if 40/4=10, which is similar to 1/10, suggesting 10% efficiency, but that might not align with the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.1% because the ratio is 10, which is equivalent to a 10% efficiency, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, another angle: If the two mutations interact to cause recombination, the number of double phages would be higher, leading to more deaths. In the experiment, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. If there's no recombination, the double phages would kill more on B. With some recombination, fewer double phages would kill, resulting in fewer plumes. The higher the recombination, the fewer the plumes. So the ratio of 10:1 suggests that recombination happened significantly, but not completely. Now, looking at the options, the smallest percentage is 0.05% (option J), but that seems very low. The next is 0.1% (D), 0.5% (G), etc. Given that the ratio is 10, which is quite significant, the recombination must be substantial. So, perhaps the closest option is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me try again with the formula. If the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, then 10 = e^{2d} \u2192 d=ln(10)/2\u22481.15. At 1% per map unit, that's 1.15% recombination. None of the options match exactly, but the closest is G (0.5%) or perhaps none. Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula uses base 10 logs instead of natural logs. Let's try that.\n\nUsing log10(ratio)=log10(10)=1=2d \u2192 d=0.5 map units. So 0.5 map units at 1% per map unit is 0.5%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 0.5%, which matches option G. That makes sense now. So despite the initial confusion, the correct answer is G, 0.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let's see: If the ratio is 40 on B and 4 on K, then 40/4=10, meaning strain B has more plumes. According to the formula, if R = P_A/P_B = e^{2d}, then ln(R)=2d \u2192 d=ln(R)/2. Here, R=10, so d\u22481.15 map units. As before. So 1.15 map units. At 1% per map unit, that's 1.15%, which is closest to option G (0.5%) or maybe none of the options match. Wait, looking back, the options include H (5%), F (0.3%), etc. Perhaps my assumption about the conversion is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the actual calculation uses log base 10 instead of natural logarithm. Let me recalculate using log base 10.\n\nIf the ratio R = 10, then log10(R) = 1 = 2d \u2192 d=0.5 map units. So 0.5 map units. Converting to percentage: 0.5 * 6 = 3% cM. But the options don't have 3%. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects the percentage relative to the total. If 1% corresponds to 1 map unit, then 0.5 map units is 0.5%. So option D is 0.1%, which is closer. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Another source says the ratio is e^{2d} = P_A / P_B. So if P_A/P_B=10, then d=ln(10)/2\u22481.15. So in terms of cM, 1.15*6\u22486.9cM. To find the percentage of recombination, considering that 1% recombination occurs over 1cM, then 6.9cM would correspond to 6.9% recombination. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around: 1cM equals 1% recombination, so 6.9cM equals 6.9%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the two mutations that recombine. If the expected number of double phages is (P_A + P_B - 2)*e^{-d}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me try to recall the formula for double mutants. The proportion of double mutants (double phages) is given by N_double = (N_A + N_B - 2) * e^{-d}, where N_A and N_B are the plumes on each lawn. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of non-recombinants and recombinants is sometimes presented as:\n\nNumber of non-recombinants = (N_A + N_B - 2) * e^{-d}\nNumber of recombinants = (N_A + N_B - 2) * (1 - e^{-d})\n\nGiven that in our case, N_A=40, N_B=4, so sum is 44. Subtracting 2 gives 42. Then the number of recombinants would be 42*(1 - e^{-d}). But without knowing the number of recombinants, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of plumes is linked to the recombination rate directly.\n\nGoing back, perhaps the formula is that the ratio of plumes on the two lichens is e^{2d}, so d=ln(ratio)/2. Thus, with r=10, d\u22481.15. In terms of cM, 1.15*6\u22486.9cM, which is about 7% recombination. But again, the options don't have this. Alternatively, if 1% corresponds to 1 map unit, then 6.9cM is 6.9%. Not matching any options except possibly none, but that's not an option here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the percentage of the two mutations that do recombine, which would be d/(6) *100. So d\u22481.15 \u2192 1.15/6\u22480.1917, which is about 19.17%. That's nowhere near the options. Alternatively, if the map units are percentages, 1% per map unit, then 1.15 map units is 1.15%. Option G is 0.5%, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the observed ratio implies that the recombination fraction is 1/10, which would correspond to 0.1% recombination, option D. Because if 40/4=10, which is similar to 1/10, suggesting 10% efficiency, but that might not align with the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.1% because the ratio is 10, which is equivalent to a 10% efficiency, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, another angle: If the two mutations interact to cause recombination, the number of double phages would be higher, leading to more deaths. In the experiment, the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1. If there's no recombination, the double phages would kill more on B. With some recombination, fewer double phages would kill, resulting in fewer plumes. The higher the recombination, the fewer the plumes. So the ratio of 10:1 suggests that recombination happened significantly, but not completely. Now, looking at the options, the smallest percentage is 0.05% (option J), but that seems very low. The next is 0.1% (D), 0.5% (G), etc. Given that the ratio is 10, which is quite significant, the recombination must be substantial. So, perhaps the closest option is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me try again with the formula. If the ratio of plumes on B to K is 10:1, then 10 = e^{2d} \u2192 d=ln(10)/2\u22481.15. At 1% per map unit, that's 1.15% recombination. None of the options match exactly, but the closest is G (0.5%) or perhaps none. Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula uses base 10 logs instead of natural logs. Let's try that.\n\nUsing log10(ratio)=log10(10)=1=2d \u2192 d=0.5 map units. So 0.5 map units at 1% per map unit is 0.5%. Therefore, the recombination rate is 0.5%, which matches option G. That makes sense now. So despite the initial confusion, the correct answer is G, 0.5%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types are present, the E. coli strain B is mostly affected, which suggests some kind of interaction or recombination between them. The experiment involves dividing the culture into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, actually, since these are phages, each plume represents an infection event. So if you have a higher concentration of phages, more will infect the bacteria. Dilution factors mean how many cells are plated per well. A higher dilution factor (like 1e7) means fewer cells are plated, so the chance of infection is lower for each phage. Lower dilution factors (like 1e5) mean more cells are plated, increasing the chance of more infections. But let me think about what happens during the experiment.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe key here is that when both mutants are present, the effect depends on their interaction. If they recombine, they might produce different offspring, affecting the lytic cycle differently. The plate where K is tested has four plumes, while B has 40. That seems like a lot more clonal expansion on B than expected. Normally, without any recombination, the number of colonies should be similar across all strains. However, with recombination, one strain might accumulate more colonies because its offspring are more likely to replicate and survive.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the T_4 phages carrying mutations in the rII region cause lytic fission in strain B but not in strain K. So in normal conditions, only strain K would be affected because strain B doesn't lyse the phage. When both mutants are present, perhaps the effect is due to the combination of their mutations causing a new type of phage that affects both. But in the experiment, the result was that half the population was divided into two groups: one with high dilution and low plumes on B, and another with low dilution and high plumes on K. The counts were 40 on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the presence of the second mutation leads to a higher rate of infection on strain K compared to B. \n\nThis could indicate that the second mutation is complementary to the first. For example, if one mutation creates an open reading frame that allows the other mutation to be expressed, leading to a new type of phage. Alternatively, it could be that the second mutation provides a survival advantage or helps in the replication process. \n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, we're supposed to determine how often the two mutations occur together within a gene.

The formula for calculating the recombination fraction (or map unit) is:\n\nMap Unit = (Number of Recombinant Genes \u00d7 2)/(Total Number of Genes)\n\nBut wait, in this context, we're dealing with mutations rather than genes. The recombination frequency typically refers to the proportion of double crossovers relative to the total possible. However, since we're talking about mutations in the same gene, it's more about whether the two mutations are linked or independent. Linkage refers to being close on the chromosome, meaning they tend to be inherited together. Independence implies no linkage, so mutations are randomly distributed.\n\nIf the mutations are linked, then the probability that a double crossover occurs decreases. But in this case, we're dealing with a single point mutation. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the question asks for the amount of recombination, perhaps it's referring to the likelihood that a double cross-over happened, which reduces the chance of recombination. But the numbers given don't directly show a double cross-over; instead, they relate to the distribution of phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, considering the plating results, if there was complete independence (no recombination), the number of plasmids on both strains should be similar. Here, K has much fewer plasmids (4 vs. 40). This suggests that the presence of the second mutation has reduced the likelihood of infection on K, possibly due to increased expression or survival advantage. If the mutations are linked, you'd expect a certain degree of correlation in the occurrence of the mutations. But the exact calculation isn't straightforward.\n\nGiven the options provided, the answer choices are percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 5%. To determine which is correct, I'll consider the difference in the number of plasmids. On B, it's 40, and on K, it's 4. That's a 10-fold increase. If recombination occurred, the distribution of mutations would affect the likelihood of infection. Assuming that recombination reduces the number of effective phages attacking the bacteria, the lower count on K indicates that the second mutation (the lysogenic phage) may be less effective when combined with the first mutation (lytic phage).\n\nIn a typical scenario with recombination, the map units would reflect the percentage of crossing over.

The ratio is 40/4 = 10, which suggests that the second mutation is more prevalent in the K strain. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect approximately equal numbers.
